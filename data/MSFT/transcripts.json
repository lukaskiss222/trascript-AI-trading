We are pleased to be with you today to share our results and talk with you about how we see fiscal 2007 shaping up. I will start today\u2019s call with highlights from last year\u2019s performance and then give you an overview of our expectations for next year. Let me remind you that we will discuss quarter 4 and fiscal year \u201906 results on the reporting structure of seven operating segments, and we will provide fiscal year 2007 guidance under the new reporting structure of five segments. You heard directly from Frank Brod on Monday of this week, when we provided you with a preview of our new reporting structure. I would like to say that I am delighted that Frank has joined our team during the quarter as Chief Accounting Officer. He brings a wealth of knowledge to the team with his prior work experience, plus his participation in the standard-setting process at the FASB. Looking at results, fiscal year 2006 marked our return to double-digit revenue growth, with top-line growth coming within our guidance provided at our last financial analyst meeting. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, resulting in 11% growth over fiscal year 2005. Not only did we benefit from better-than-expected PC demand and an overall healthy tech economy, we also enjoyed strong customer acceptance of our newly launched products. Our Home and Entertainment, Server and Tools and Business Solutions groups, which all had launches during the year, turned in a combined 20% plus year-over-year revenue growth. The Home and Entertainment division made significant progress, and sold 5 million Xbox 360 consoles for the year. Second, our core businesses turned in an excellent performance with double-digit bookings growth in both the quarter and full year. Unearned revenue finished the year growing 19%, which is a tremendous performance. We saw broad-based strength from business customers for not only our core Windows, Office and server products, but also increased demand for communications products and services. Third, you will see the both Business Solutions and Mobile Embedded Devices exceeded our original revenue guidance for the year, and achieved operating profitability, which we forecast to be sustainable going forward. We are particularly pleased about hitting this missed milestone, given the change in our reporting structure, and I want to give credit in particular to the teams working on those businesses. Finally, we made substantial progress on our strategy of returning cash to shareholders during fiscal year 2006. We have purchased over $6 billion of shares since I last talked with you, and we closed the year returning over $23 billion of cash to shareholders through dividend and stock repurchases. I am very pleased to announce on the second anniversary of our $30 billion stock buyback plan that we have completed that program in half the time originally authorized. With that program now completed, our Board of Directors has authorized a $20 billion tender offer to be completed over 20 business days, starting tomorrow. They have also given authorization to repurchase up to an additional $20 billion of company stock at management's discretion. This latter authorization expires in June, 2011. Moving to fiscal 2007 guidance, the coming year brings the second major installment on our multi-year product cycles and a period of improving revenue growth for the company. Let me make a couple of key points about the year. First, we are expecting continued double-digit revenue growth. The launches of Windows Vista and Office 2007 will drive significant revenue growth in the second half of the year. Combine that with the seasonally strong entertainment and devices revenue around the holiday, and you will see a very strong revenue growth in Q2 and beyond. Second, growth in operating income in the first half of the year will lag revenue growth due to increasing mix of Xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments and preparations for the launches of our flagship products. This trend should reverse in the second half of the year, when we expect operating income will grow faster than revenues. Third, we are making some big investments in key areas of long-term growth. You are going to hear more from me today on these subjects, with additional color and detail at the financial analyst meeting next week, about how these investments will help drive future growth for the company. Fiscal 2007 is going to be an important and exciting year for us. We are very pleased with our expected top-line growth and we believe we are making the right investments for our future. In particular, our announced tender buyback combined with our expected revenue performance lays the groundwork for strong EPS growth in fiscal 2007, while still investing in innovations to drive future long-term growth. With those high-level themes for 2006 and 2007, I am going to turn the call over to Colleen now for some more details on how the 2006 fiscal year closed out.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. In the interest of providing more time on today's call for Chris to discuss our fiscal year 2007 guidance, I am going to keep my remarks about our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 performance brief. Overall, it was a strong finish to the year. Specifically, during the quarter: I will now provide more detail on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top-line financial and business momentum points and then follow-up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. Revenue growth for the quarter was 16%. That is the fastest quarterly growth rate in over two years and the highest Q4 growth rate in seven years. Strong results in Home and Entertainment, Server and Tools, and the Client businesses were the primary drivers, accounting for 85% of the absolute revenue growth in the quarter. Overall, five of our seven business groups recorded double-digit growth rates. Revenue growth for the year was 11%, with quarterly growth rates accelerating throughout the year, driven by strong product launches such as SQL Server 2005, Xbox 360, Dynamics CRM 3.0, and Visual Studio 2005. Our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server and Tools performed well. Taken together, they achieved double-digit revenue growth and exceeded our expectations of a year ago. Healthy PC and server hardware market growth were key contributors to our results, both during the quarter and during the year. The PC market was stronger than we expected, with an estimated growth rate of approximately 11% to 12% in Q4. The consumer segment growth rate outpaced that of the business segment by a factor of two and all regions registered double-digit growth, with the exception of North America and Japan. Our mix of product billings continued to evolve this quarter, with approximately 30% from the OEMs, 40% from multi-year licensing agreements, 15% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Relative to prior year, our mix continues to highlight a noticeable swing from license-only sales to multi-year licensing agreements in front of flagship product launches such as Windows Vista and Office 2007, scheduled for later this year. As a result, we had a very strong quarter overall from a volume licensing perspective, with strong renewals on enterprise agreements in particular. We estimate that EA renewal experience is trending to the high-end of our historical range of 66% to 75%. In addition, select and open annuity growth significantly outpaced non-annuity licensing. Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at a record $10.9 billion, up 19% over the same period in the prior year, and a record $2 billion increase over the prior quarter. Our contracted not-billed balance at the end of June was also sequentially higher, and continues to exceed $9 billion. If you consider our reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted not-billed balances, you will find that bookings growth exceeded 25% for the quarter, and over 10% for the full fiscal year. We believe these results are indicative of not only strong customer acceptance of our recently launched products, but more importantly the compelling value proposition and growing customer demand for our future products. I want to also point out that our revenue results for the quarter include about $180 million, or 2 percentage points of growth, resulting from a change in the billing methodology for OEM distributors in our system builder channel. We now bill and record revenue for all of our OEM distributors regardless of their size when the product is delivered to them. Now I would like to provide revenue highlights by business segment. Client revenue grew 12%, driven by OEM revenue growth of 13%. OEM revenue growth resulted from 19% license unit growth. The 6 percentage point difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth this quarter was caused primarily by growing volume in emerging markets and the relative strength of the consumer segment of the market. We were particularly pleased with growth of 6% in Client's commercial and retail licensing products, driven primarily by strong growth in multi-year contract agreements. This is the first quarter of growth for Client's commercial and retail licensing business since Q1 of fiscal 2005. Server and Tools delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 16th consecutive quarter --18% revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong momentum from new product launches earlier in the year, including SQL Server, which grew over 35%. Windows server performance also remained strong, with net deployment growth consistent with overall X86 server market growth. Information Worker revenue grew 6% to $3.1 billion, driven by strong growth in multi-year contract agreements for Office and momentum in our real-time communications business. The shift to annuity offerings for Office accelerated this quarter, signaling strong customer demand for our upcoming Office 2007 product. As a result, unearned revenue for Information Worker was up 28% from the prior year. MBS revenue was up 16% from the prior year, resulting from continued strength in our Dynamics ERP products, as well as Dynamics CRM momentum. During the quarter, over 50,000 new Dynamics CRM users were added as the product grew rapidly across all segments, geographies and industry verticals. Strong revenue growth and efficiencies drove MBS operating profitability for both the quarter and for the first time ever, for the full year. MSN revenue was $580 million, and down 3% with flat advertising growth and a 13% decline in access revenue. Display revenue for the quarter grew in line with the market and we continue to make good progress in ramping our adCenter platform. Currently, we are servicing 100% of our U.S. search traffic on adCenter, along with traffic in select countries internationally. MED capped off a very strong year and its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in excess of 40%. During fiscal 2006, license growth for Windows mobile-based phones was 90% and the division achieved operating profitability for the first time ever. Lastly, Home and Entertainment growth of 94% during the quarter was driven by strong performance across all of its businesses. Xbox grew over 125% as a result of 1.8 million Xbox 360 unit shipments during the quarter. With an installed base of 5 million consoles and growing, key profit drivers such as Xbox 360 software and accessory attach, remain very strong relative to previous console launches from competitors. Now for the rest of the income statement. While revenue increased 16% for the quarter and 11% for the year, cost of revenue increased 53% and 27% respectively, due primarily to Xbox 360 console volumes. As a result, gross margin relative to the prior year was down 4 percentage points for the quarter and 2 percentage points for fiscal 2006. Q4 operating expenses, other than cost of revenue, increase $414 million, or 8% excluding legal charges. Aside from cost of revenue, operating expenses excluding legal charges in fiscal 2006 increased 11%. Operating income for the quarter was $4.2 billion, excluding legal charges, up 13% or $487 million. If you set aside legal charges in the Home and Entertainment results, which were disproportionately impacted by negative margin console sales, operating margins in Q4 improved by 2 percentage points over the prior year. Looking at the full fiscal year, operating income was $17.6 billion, excluding legal charges, up 6% or $960 million from the prior year. Operating margins in fiscal 2006 were also negatively impacted by strong Xbox 360 console sales. If you normalize for legal charges and Home and Entertainment results, you will find that operating income grew slightly faster than revenue and operating margins were consistent with the prior year. Investment income and other totaled $317 million during the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 34% as a result of non-deductible legal charges. The effective tax rate for the quarter and the year, excluding non-recurring items, was 31%. Diluted shares outstanding were 10.3 billion for the quarter and 10.5 billion for the year, down 5% and 3% respectively from the prior year as a result of execution against our share repurchase program. Boiling it all down, earnings per share, excluding legal charges for the quarter, were $0.31. For the full year, we delivered earnings per share, excluding legal charges and tax benefits, of $1.27, which is in line with the guidance we provided to you a year ago. Chris will now provide you with our expectations for Q1 and fiscal year 2007.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. I am going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and the first quarter, and then close with my comments with some color on today's stock buyback announcement. Before we get into specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. The fiscal 2007 forecast assumes a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand from where we exited in 2006, and our forecast does not include any significant impacts from foreign exchange movements. We expect PC unit demand to continue to remain healthy but to moderate from the growth rates we saw in 2006, particularly in our fiscal second quarter, ahead of the launch of Windows Vista. Specifically, we expect PC unit growth for fiscal 2007 to be 8% to 10% for the year and between 9% and 11% for the first quarter. We estimate that PC unit growth rates will be higher in consumer segments than in business segments, and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. On the server hardware front, we estimate the total market should grow 10% to 12% for the year. Let me go through some detailed guidance. For the full year, we expect our revenue to come in between $49.7 billion to $50.7 billion, growing 12% to 14%. This is in line with the guidance we gave you in April and is actually a little better on dollar terms, given our stronger finish to fiscal year 2006. Our growth is driven by broad-based revenue growth across all of our five segments. For the first quarter, we expect revenue of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, which represents a growth rate of 9% to 11%. There are a couple items to note when you consider our first-quarter revenue: When thinking about the shape of the year, given the timing of our key product launches, you should expect revenue growth to be strong, beginning in the second quarter, driven in part by revenue growth from our Entertainment and Devices divisions. Furthermore, we expect an increase in the seasonality of our total expenses in the first half due to increased product costs associated with EDD console shipments. Revenue guidance in our recently announced five business units reporting structure is as follows: for Client, we expect full-year growth to be 8% to 10% and Q1 growth to be 5% to 6%. That guidance includes improvement in the commercial and retail portion of our business due to our launch of Windows Vista, targeted to go to businesses in November and consumers in January. For the OEM portion of the business, we expect revenue to grow slower than the PC hardware market, due to increased concentration amongst larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets. Server and Tools revenue should grow 14% to 15% for the year and 12% to 14% for the first quarter. Coming off the impressive growth in last year, Server and Tools will continue to show double-digit growth throughout the year from the sustained momentum of SQL Server and Visual Studio, combined with growth in Windows Server, our security and management products, and enterprise services. We forecast revenue in the Online Services group to grow between 7% and 11% for the year and be flat to down 4% in Q1. Growth in the first half of fiscal 2007 will be negatively impacted on a year-over-year comparison due to the transition to our adCenter platform in the U.S., and our upcoming transition to adCenter in the U.K. slated to begin in August. We are pleased with the non-financial results from adCenter, such as 100% of our U.S. search traffic running through the platform and the positive feedback from advertisers on the ROI of their advertising programs. Microsoft Business division revenue should grow 9% to 10% for the year, and about 3% to 5% for the first quarter. Revenue growth in Q1 will be tempered by customers' preference to purchase annuity contracts, as well as a decrease in the rate of license-only purchases in front of the launch of Office 2007, expected later in the calendar year. We are expecting strong revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year. We feel that our customers' continued preference to purchase annuity contracts indicates their excitement about Office 2007. We also expect continued strong demand from our Dynamics products, building upon the momentum in fiscal 2006. For the Entertainment and Devices Division, we are forecasting another strong year with full-year revenue growth of 31% to 46%, and first-quarter growth of 53% to 60%. The yearly guidance implies by the end of the fiscal year we will have sold 13 million to 15 million Xbox 360 consoles since launch. The EDD team is carrying good momentum into fiscal year \u201807 and growth will benefit from holiday sales of Xbox 360, increased commercial rollouts of IPTV, and continued introductions of devices running Windows Mobile 5.0 with Direct Push technology. Operating income for the year is expected to be between $18.9 billion and $19.4 billion, growing at 8% to 10%, excluding legal charges. For the quarter, we expect operating income to be between $4.0 billion and $4.2 billion. Quarter 1 operating income includes the impact of a higher overall mix of lower-margin revenues for Xbox 360, increased costs associated with the Online Services group, as well as operating costs in preparation for the launch of Windows Vista and Office 2007. On today's call, with our planning process now complete, I would like to give you some additional color and guidance on expenses that we do not usually give in our earnings call. We do not expect to give this level of detail going forward, but know there is a lot of interest in the area for next year. Because of our evolving mix of businesses and given the wide range of COGS estimates in the financial community, I want to provide you with some guidance here on how we think about it going into our fiscal year. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue should increase between 1 to 2 points for the year, and should be up 3 points in Q1, resulting from an increase in the number of Xbox 360 consoles we will sell, additional costs associated with infrastructure and content costs in our Online Services group, and support and packaging costs for the retail launches of Windows Vista and Office 2007. Also, as we discussed in our third-quarter earnings call, we will be increasing our operating expenses to fund a variety of investments and activities in fiscal 2007. I would like to provide additional color on the size of that spending today and you will hear more about the strategic nature of these investments next week at our financial analyst meeting. On our last earnings call, you will recall that I categorized our spending into four general areas, which were the following: In regard to the first group, Xbox products costs, we have now given you guidance on the number of units we are forecasting to sell by the end of fiscal year and have provided company-wide growth estimates for our cost of revenue, which was expressed as a percentage of revenue. This information should help you quantify the impact of Xbox. The second group, marketing and field sales costs, contains two distinct pools of spend. The first pool is what I consider launch costs, and totals approximately $450 million of increased spending in fiscal year \u201807 over fiscal year \u201806. That is the amount we will spend in various areas, such as creating awareness for Office 2007, Windows Vista and marketing for Xbox during the holidays. The second pool contains investments we will make in our sales force to ensure we have the appropriate level of resources to successfully execute in taking all of our new products to market and serve customers. The second pool represents roughly $450 million. Combined, this marketing and field sales category is in the range of a $900 million investment next year. The total increase in spending also reflects general increases in salaries and costs in that area, and will help us deliver our record $5 billion to $6 billion sale increase forecasted for the coming fiscal year. The third group is developing either current high-growth products or developing new products and services to lay the groundwork for future growth. This group includes both announced products, such as our efforts in unified communications, mobility, business intelligence, security, high-performance computing, web servers, management, IPTV and also unannounced products and services that we believe are likely during the year. It also includes spending on our long-term research efforts. This is by far the largest amount of incremental investment for the company in fiscal year \u201807 compared to fiscal year \u201806, and totals approximately $1 billion across all of our business groups and corporate research staff. Our $1 billion consists of $200 million to $300 million in each of the following four groups: MBD, Server and Tools, EDD, and our Corporate Research group. These efforts in general are much longer-term and therefore drive modest amounts of revenue in the coming fiscal year. The fourth and final group of expenses is the incremental amount we will be spending on our services strategy. We intend to grow operating expenses in total in this area by approximately $500 million in fiscal year \u201807. This will be spread across developing and acquiring content to fuel our display advertising, continuing to build out and improve our search offerings and ad platforms, and funding increases in our infrastructure for data centers and equipment. The return on this spend is to some extent in fiscal year 2007, but also further out to support our MSN and large strategies. This group also includes spending on our Office Live and CRM Live products. All told, adding up these four buckets should amount to approximately $2.4 billion of incremental investments in fiscal year \u201807. As you can see by our guidance, total operating expenses excluding cost of goods sold are growing by about $2.7 billion and that maps to the presentations by company management to investors during the quarter, adjusted for our assumptions around foreign exchange rates. The remaining $300 million of operating cost growth is largely due to general increases in costs and unallocated acquisition amounts that we may do during the year. These acquisitions generally have a high year one accounting cost. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $1.43 to $1.47, and $0.30 to $0.32 for the first quarter. These numbers assume the full completion of our announced tender offer, which we estimate will have an impact of between $0.05 to $0.06 for the full fiscal year, and $0.01 in quarter 1. These earnings also assume an effective tax rate of 30.5%. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2007 up 4% to 6%. Contracted not-billed should also finish 2007 up from current levels. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201806 to the first quarter of fiscal year \u201807, we expect the sequential decrease to be significantly greater than what you have seen in the last two years. This decline will be due to the absolute size of our fiscal fourth quarter annuity billings, relative to what we are projecting for quarter 1, as well as the relatively small amount of contract value that is up for renewal. Also, when looking at our full-year unearned revenue guidance, we are modeling a moderation in the recent annuity mix of our billings as both Office 2007 and Windows Vista will be available to customers in the second half of the year. I am asked by investors about areas of upside opportunities and downside risks to our guidance. Aside from our normal competitive, legal and general market risks -- in particular PC and server growth rates -- we have our share of execution risks in the next year. Our plan relies on execution on product launches and our ability to connect with customers once the products are in the market. There is also uncertainty around timing, supply and consumer response to upcoming game console launches by major competitors. Finally, as management has stated previously, the cost of acquiring and serving customers in our online businesses could increase. Specifically in terms of EPS guidance, our guidance assumes successful completion of the announced tender, with the resulting reduction in shares more than offsetting the loss of investment income from the cash used in the tender. Some potential upside to our guidance includes: Before moving to the Q&A, I would like to make a couple of comments regarding the specifics of the share repurchase plan we announced today. The first component of today's buyback announcement is a $20 billion tender offer that, assuming it is fully completed inside the tender range, will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 8%.  The period for people to tender their shares will begin tomorrow, July 21st, and is scheduled to expire on or about August 17th of this year. The tender offer is priced between $22.50 and $24.75 per share. Our executive officers and directors have advised that they will not be tendering any shares. The second component of the announcement is an authorization for a $20 billion stock repurchase plan to be completed at a pace and size to be decided upon by management, and with an authorization expiry date of June, [2011]. I would like to reemphasize the amount that we purchased under this program could vary throughout the term of the plan and there is likely to be quarters where we have little or no activity against it. It is also important to note that this is simply an authorization, not a commitment. We will always report our activity of any quarterly [arrears], but I do not intend to comment on any potential forecast activity. So to wrap up, the fourth quarter served as a strong close to what turned out to be a good year. Full year revenue growth of accelerated to double-digits, gaining momentum throughout the year, helped by customer acceptance of our newly launched products and continued robust PC and server hardware sales. 2007 is shaping up well. We are looking to generate another year of double-digit revenue and EPS growth as we deliver new releases of our two flagships products, Windows Vista and Office 2007, and build upon the momentum in Server and Tools and Entertainment and Devices. We will make significant investments in a variety of areas to build the next wave of growth for the company, and we will continue to execute on a strategy of returning cash to shareholders. That wraps up my financial comments. I am looking forward to catching up with a number of you next week at our financial analyst meeting. You will hear then from our business leaders and receive further insight on the topics we have discussed today, and our thoughts for 2007 and beyond. So we have some time for questions. I will hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started, and thank you.\nColleen Healy: Great. Let\u2019s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you, good afternoon. I was wondering, Chris, if you could give us an idea what Vista release assumptions are embedded into your guidance for fiscal year \u201807 in terms of timing? Then I just have a follow-up to that, if possible.\nChris Liddell: Sure, Heather. Embedded in that in Vista is the November release to business and January to consumers. On the Office side, by the end of the year for business and the beginning of next year for consumers, so it is the same base case as we have previously talked about.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, and I guess the granularity that I was looking for is if so many people are moving to annuity agreements as a result of Vista, as evidenced by your strong bookings growth this quarter, even if it did slip from the January consumer release out for let's just say a month or two, would it really impact your guidance that much, given that the enterprise customers have basically paid you already and you are just recognizing that revenue on a systematic basis?\nChris Liddell: Yes, that is a good observation and you are correct. There will be a relatively modest impact. There will obviously be some FTP sales that we would lose if it was to be deferred. To give you a sense of order of magnitude, and obviously this depends on the shape of the year as much as anything else, but if we were to see a slip let's say of a quarter, to give you a financial magnitude, we think that would have an impact of around $200 million to $400 million. Obviously, revenue that we would like to see but not significant in the overall guidance.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Heather. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. One, if you could just talk about when you expect to actually do your launch-related spending? In other words, Bill Gates I think was mentioned in the press talking about an 80% probability of release of Vista on time in January. I am wondering how you are going to be timing the actual launch activities surrounding what still seems to be sort of a moving target. Secondly, if you could give us a little bit more color on how this Dutch auction process will actually work mechanically? Not to expect too much on it, but if you could just give us a little more bit more color on how you can accomplish the range of $22.50, $24.70, that will be useful perspective as well. Thank you.\nChris Liddell: In terms of spending, obviously we will time that around the launch date. As we get more and more closer to that and more certain of that, we will start to work that in. We have embedded some plans already and that is characterized inside not only our first-quarter guidance but for the year overall. Some of the decisions, we will wait until we have the absolute date locked in. At this stage, we have some flexibility around that. At this stage, it is not going to be a significant difference in [pattern] of spending, but as when we lock the date in we will certainly press the button on the total spending overall. In terms of the Dutch auction, just to go back to basics, it will open tomorrow and close on August 17th, as I mentioned. People will be able to sell or offer to sell shares inside the range that we have bid during that period. In essence, they will be able to offer a certain number of shares at price points inside the range. So X shares at Y price, X plus Z at Y, at different price points. So we will have a schedule of prices at which people are willing to sell shares. We will add up the aggregate of all of those offers and strike a price which clears the market. The price at which we can buy $20 billion of value of shares, that price is the price that we will pay to everyone who has bid whether they have bid below that or not. We will play the clearing price then to all successful sellers. It is like an auction system. It is a Dutch auction in the sense that people will bid at different price points against us, and then we will take a clearing price on the market inside the range.\nKash Rangan: So the clearing price ought to be somewhere between that range you are talking about? In a best case scenario, it would be $24.70, but maybe not exactly at that level?\nChris Liddell: There are $0.10 increments inside the range. It clearly could obviously be at the absolute bottom or the absolute top of the range. It does not have to be inside the range. It could be inside or equal to the range limits.\nKash Rangan: Great, thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Kash. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Goldman Sachs.\nRick Sherlund: Thank you. Just to follow up on Kash's comment, for clarification, you would expect one date where you will have a clearing price, so there is only one date within that range where the transaction will take place?\nChris Liddell: Yes, that is correct. That is the last day. Up until that time, people can offer to tender but we will not strike the price until the very last day, by which time all offers to sell will be collected. We strike it on, if you like, the last minute of the last day. Any offers made before that will just simply be aggregated into that timing.\nRick Sherlund: Will there be an advantage to offering earlier, or would you sense that people would wait until the last couple of days to submit their offers?\nChris Liddell: Well, there is no advantage from a seller's point of view because we are not legally able to buy early. We are constrained by the rules of tender, which we are obviously following totally. People can logistically get some advantage, if they want to but it is entirely up to them. We do not want to influence behavior at all. We just want to stick inside the rules but the rules specify that we cannot accept offers until the final.\nRick Sherlund: Okay. On the Online Services group, the guidance for the year was revenue growth of 7% to 11%, which looks pretty encouraging. I am wondering if you can offer any insight into how much of this is coming from Windows Live, MSN? Are you assuming that MSN, when adCenter begins to gain traction, I wonder if you can just give us a little more granularity on what is behind those numbers?\nChris Liddell: From a revenue growth point of view, Windows Live is not a significant contributor in fiscal year \u201807. It obviously helps to drive some traffic but we are not seeing that has a big increment in this year. That is an investment in future years. adCenter will certainly help. What you have year over year is quite different shapes, so we came out of last fiscal year with our revenue for search effectively going down as we moved off, over to and onto adCenter, through the shape of this year, we are now fully on adCenter in the U.S., and as we start to get better comparables as we go through the year, you will see much better quarter-on-quarter comparison. As we scale up adCenter, it will also help, clearly. During the course of the year you will see an improvement and that is certainly embedded in the numbers that you see. Also, obviously the Access business is still decreasing, but it is becoming less significant in terms of the decrease. We are looking forward to a good continued year on the display side and a transition year on the search side.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Rick. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie DiBona with Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie DiBona: I would actually like to follow up on Rick's question here around MSN, because if we look at that guidance, how should we evaluate adCenter? When can we start to see you start to turn the corner and at least track towards the overall search ad market here? We would expect obviously access to be declining and display to be sort of in line with the market. Just those two things could get you to the guidance you have here. Could you give us some more granularity on how we can evaluate your progress with adCenter?\nChris Liddell: Yes, I think there is two ways, Charlie. One is, if you like, qualitative and through the year, we will share as much visibility as we can. I know Kevin and Ray are certainly intending to talk about it next week, just about some of the kind of qualitative metrics as we transition adCenter. The number of advertisers on us, for example, the general level of acceptance. That will give you some leading indicators of how we see the health of it. In terms of lagging indicators, the bottom line, you will be able to see our overall revenue growth. You will obviously be able to make some assumptions about what is happening on the display side because generally speaking, we are tracking in line with markets there. The access will be progressively less of a factor, so the delta will be the search side and you will be able to see, as the year goes on, on a quarter-by-quarter basis when you compare it both sequentially and also to the previous quarter, you will be able to see some of the adCenter impact directly from a financial output point of view.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Charlie. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Holt with JP Morgan.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. My question is about the detail on the expenses for fiscal \u201807, which was very helpful. Historically, you said that some of the Xbox ramp expenses are effectively going to be one-time in nature. Presumably, some of the marketing and launch-related costs for Vista and Office are also going to be one-time oriented. As you think about the long-term spending profile for the company, if you could detail what you view as sort of a moment-in-time set of expenses versus what we should expect to see on an ongoing basis?\nChris Liddell: We have tried to give you visibility in that by talking about launch spending -- launch and marketing spending as a category. I will not describe it as entirely one-off because there are other launches that happen year by year, but we bracketed that, and that is the $450 million. In terms of Vista, Office 2007 and Xbox launch-related spending, that is in the category of 450, so that gives you some visibility as to, on a year-by-year basis, what you might consider as one-off. In terms of the other areas of spending, they are more ongoing in nature. Clearly in some of the businesses, we are building the business up so it is not necessarily continuous at that level. But they are not, if you like, one-off in nature, in particular when we are hiring R&D and salespeople who are continuous there afterwards.\nAdam Holt: If I could ask a follow-up on the bookings strength in the quarter, you noted that renewal rates were tracking towards the high-end of historical levels. Does that imply that renewals were primarily behind the strength in unearned in the quarter, or did you also see an up-tick in new customer billings? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: It was a bit of both. Certainly the renewals was very strong, as you point out, and that was -- I think that was the majority of it, but also we saw good acceptance on the new side as well. The field did a fabulous job in the fourth quarter and really got out there. They had some visibility and some good products to sell and they took the opportunity to do a great job, both with existing and new customers.\nAdam Holt: Thank you very much.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Adam. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Credit Suisse.\nJason Maynard: Good afternoon. I had one follow-up question on spending for FY07. I wanted to get a little bit more color on what your expectations are around for cap-ex. Specifically, over a couple-year period, should we see a material change in terms of how you look at cap-ex as you build out data center infrastructure for a lot of your online services?\nChris Liddell: Yes, cap-ex is going up, and we certainly talked about that externally. We will see an increase year over year of around $600 million to $700 million on cap-ex, but that covering cap-ex of all nature, so it is not only in the MSN area, which is probably the one that people are most interested in. It is also general facilities cap-ex. In the MSN area, year on year we are probably looking at an increase, depending on some of the decisions we are going to make, around $200 million to $300 million year on year. That is building the infrastructure that we believe is necessary for the future of the business, so we will be building capacity that we not only need next year but also starting to build capacity for future years there afterward, as well.\nJason Maynard: I have one quick follow-up on Server and Tools, just to try to get a little bit more color around your expectations for Windows Server growth. Specifically, any commentary you are seeing about growth rates relative to the Linux growth rate opportunity as well.\nChris Liddell: We are happy with the trends there. As I mentioned, we have grown, broadly speaking, in line with the market. We now have a product that can compete in the high-performance area so we think that is a good opportunity. Some of the spending we are looking at, some of the incremental spending that I bucketed into the growing and new areas, is targeted at the Windows Server area, in particular in some of the markets where Linux is strong. You are not necessarily going to see a benefit from that in fiscal year \u201807 for the reasons we talked about, but certainly that is an area where we think there is a fabulous opportunity for us and it is hence one of the reasons why we are investing in it.\nJason Maynard: Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thank you. We may have time just for one or two other questions. Next question, please, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: I was wondering, Chris, if you could give us any kind of breakdown in terms of your Client -- for guidance achieving -- on the benefits from China, particularly with Acer and Lenovo now standardizing on the Microsoft products.\nChris Liddell: We saw good growth in OEM units relative to PC units in the quarter, and we are predicting that general trend is not necessarily to be as strong as it is out of the quarter, but going forward. It is too early to really say there is a substantial difference as a result of those contracts but our efforts aimed at anti-piracy generally we believe adds let's say 1 to 2 percentage points on our year-by-year basis -- it might move around in the quarter -- between OEM units and PC units. Clearly the price point for some of those sales is lower so it does drag down our average price, but in terms of our growth rate, it generally helps by about 1% to 2%.\nBrendan Barnicle: Great, thank you.\nColleen Healy: Great, thanks. Next question, please, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Regarding MSN, how should we think about the return to profitability? Is that more of a \u201808 timeframe? If you could also just follow up regarding adCenter. You mentioned it is online now in the U.S. The rest of the world, your timing on when you expect that initiative will be fully up?\nChris Liddell: In terms of MSN, it is full-on the U.S. It is in the U.K. in August. It is in France now. It is in Singapore now. We are not giving a particular schedule for when we will be 100% in the year but clearly it is in our line of sight. It is not far off that we are going to have 100% of our business anyway on adCenter. What was the other half of your question? Sorry.\nBrent Thill: Regarding profitability in MSN.\nChris Liddell: Profitability, yes. We have said, as I said in the previous quarter, that we do not expect MSN to be profitable in this fiscal year. By definition, therefore, it is later out than that. Based on the revenue guidance that we have given and some of the expense guidance that we have given, I imagine people will be able to get some shape of what we are looking at. We see for MSN that fiscal year \u201807 will be an investment year.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thank you. We have time for one last question please, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Laura Lederman with William Blair.\nLaura Lederman: Saved by the bell. Real quickly, can you talk about SQL Server growth? Is that going to be in line with the Server and Tools growth, or higher? You have done so great in the database market for several years. Also, when you talk about the 50,000 new users for CRM, could you talk about how much of that was hosted in the quarter versus how much was on premise? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: On the SQL Server side, we are looking at 35% growth. It has been extremely successful and is growing faster than the Server and Tools business overall. I am not sure I want to put a number out for what that will look like going forward but embedded inside our guidance is what we consider to be very good growth. We still think from a price point of view, a quality point of view, it is a great product relative to its competitors -- all the reason why we have been able to achieve market share growth in the past. There is no reason to assume they are not going to continue in the future.\nColleen Healy: Laura, could you repeat your hosted question? We just did not hear it.\nLaura Lederman: Sure. The 50,000 new users added for the CRM last quarter, can you give us a sense how much of that was hosted, how much of that was on premise? What is going on there in the mix?\nColleen Healy: Yes, we are delighted with that figure, even stacking against competitors. It is a nice volume for us. It is good momentum. It really does represent the choices that we are giving customers, Laura. It is not just hosted. It is not just a license from Microsoft. As you know, currently you can buy a license from Microsoft, host it yourself. You can go to our partners -- they will host it for you. The 50,000 is inclusive of both of those. We are looking forward to being able to offer additional choice to consumers by hosting ourselves, really starting second quarter of calendar year 2007.\nLaura Lederman: Final question, if you look at the Business division growth of 9% to 10% for \u201807, can you talk a little bit about what you see driving that, and the components as well? Just a little bit of granularity.\nChris Liddell: Sure, that is for the division overall. Obviously with Office 2007 coming along, that is a big driver, although that is more of the second half of the year. Also, as we see some of these enterprise agreements that we are signing flowing through the accounts, that will certainly help. Growth in the CRM and ERP products, so the old MBD segment will continue to grow very strongly and that will help the overall division as well. In particular in the second half of the year, but general strength across all of those areas.\nLaura Lederman: Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Great.\nChris Liddell: We are going to have to cut off now, but I appreciate all of your questions. I will hand it back to Colleen. Look forward to seeing a number of you in a week's time.\nColleen Healy: Thank you, everybody, for your participation in today's call.

Chris.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us for today's call. I'm going to begin with the key points from our third quarter's performance and then take a look at quarter four and fiscal 2007. During the quarter, revenue growth accelerated to 13% from 9% in quarter two and 6% in quarter one. We had good market momentum of recently launched products, which remained strong, and we continued our execution on returning cash to shareholders. Our operating income was, however, lower than we had guided in the quarter, which can be attributed in the following order to: We continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses, particularly in driving revenue. Revenue growth for our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server & Tools grew a combined 9% year-over-year for the quarter. We continue to see strong corporate demand and strength in PC and server hardware unit shipments. Revenue growth of 29% in the business groups that have had recent product launches demonstrates our ability to choose the right places to focus our innovation efforts and make investments. Some specific examples are SQL Server, which continues to post impressive year-over-year growth rates. Its quarter three revenue growth, in excess of 30%, drove Server & Tools to its highest quarterly revenue growth rate for the year. Also, Home & Entertainment, Mobile & Embedded & Business Solutions all had good sales quarters. Combined, they posted over $0.5 billion of absolute revenue growth over the prior-year period, which equates to 68% growth. In the quarter, we also made significant strides in ramping up the supply of Xbox 360 consoles. We also continued our momentum on returning cash to shareholders, purchasing $4.9 billion worth of our stock, which brings us just over $15.5 billion of stock repurchases this fiscal year. Now, I would like to make a few points about how the fiscal fourth quarter is shaping up. First, we continue to expect strong double-digit revenue growth, driven by sustained momentum across all of our businesses. Q4 is usually a seasonally good quarter for revenue in our Information Worker, Server & Tools and Business Solutions groups, and we expect that trend to continue. We also expect increasing growth from Home & Entertainment with the improving supply of Xbox 360 consoles. Second, we will continue to accelerate the rate at which we invest in our business. Since we provided guidance three months ago, we have completed our senior-level strategy reviews and reassessed the strength of customer demand for our existing and potential new products. We see an increasing set of opportunities and, admittedly, challenges. We're going to target them with investments that leverage our ability to win. As I mentioned on the last call, we're investing in our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server & Tools to prepare for the most significant wave of product launches in a decade. We are aggressively investing in MSN to continue to meet the competitive challenges we see and develop and deploy a world-class set of online services, and we are quickening the pace of development in a number of high-growth new business areas. I will discuss these investments later in the call. With that overview, I would like to turn the call over to Colleen for more details on the quarter, and then I will provide you with more details on our fourth quarter and a preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2007.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, the accelerating revenue growth thus far in fiscal year '06 resulted in 13% growth during the quarter, which was driven by customer demand for our new products as well as healthy PC and server hardware sales. Specifically during the quarter, revenue was $10.9 billion, consistent with guidance entering the quarter. Operating income was $3.9 billion, which includes $397 million of legal charges and was lower than our guidance. Earnings per share were $0.29, which includes $0.03 for legal charges. And we returned over $5.8 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I will highlight drivers of the strong revenue performance during the quarter, as well as outline the areas of incremental costs and investments. I will start by discussing top line financial and business momentum points, and I will follow up with revenue performance for each of the business groups. Then I will discuss operating expenses, and I will wrap up with an overview of operating income performance, as well as balance sheet and cash flow information. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. Revenue growth this quarter was driven by strong business and consumer market momentum for our new products. Server & Tools had yet another outstanding quarter, growing over 16%. Home & Entertainment grew 85% as Xbox sales more than doubled. MED and MBS grew 46% and 21%, respectively, on robust demand for our Windows Mobile and Microsoft Dynamics product lines. Taken together, these four businesses grew revenue 29% and delivered roughly 75% of our absolute revenue growth for the quarter. We were also very pleased with the continued strength in PC shipments for the quarter, which resulted in Client revenue growth of 8%. The IT spending environment was largely in line with our expectations. As mentioned, PC hardware and server market growth remains robust. Demand was generally healthy across all customer segments, and from a regional perspective, EMEA and emerging markets continue to be relatively strong. We estimate PC market growth during the quarter at 12% to 13%, which was in line with our expectations three months ago. Consistent with the past several quarters, consumer PC shipment growth outpaced business shipments, and emerging market growth continued to significantly outpaced mature markets. PC unit demand was broad-based regionally, with double-digit growth rates in all geographies except for North America and Japan. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was around 35% for OEMs, 27% for multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license-only sales and the balance from our other businesses. This mix is different from the prior year, as a result of strong growth in our Home & Entertainment business and a shift from license only to multi-year licensing agreements. We had good results overall from a volume licensing perspective, with strong renewals on enterprise agreements. In addition, select and open annuity results for the quarter were very strong relative to non-annuity licensing. As a result of these robust annuity licensing results, our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at $8.9 billion, which was a little higher than we had anticipated, and up 12% over the same period in prior year. Our contracted not billed balance at the end of March was lower sequentially and continued to exceed $9 billion. Taking into account our reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted not billed balances, you will find that our bookings growth for the quarter approached 15% overall and in excess of 10% for our core businesses of Client, Information Worker and Server & Tools. Now, let's work our way through the P&L. Revenue growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange rates. Breaking this down by business segment, Client revenue grew 8%, driven by OEM revenue growth of 10%, offset by a 6% decline in commercial and retail licensing. The OEM revenue growth resulted from 16% license unit growth. As you have seen in previous quarters, the difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth is caused primarily by three factors: Consistent with the relative strength in the consumer segment of the market and the growing momentum behind Windows Media Center, we continue to see a change within the sales mix of our Premium Edition operating system licensed to OEMs. While OEM premium mix of 53% was up 4 percentage points from the prior year, a larger percentage of Premium Edition sales were made to consumers purchasing Windows Media Center, which carries a lower price relative to Windows Professional. During the quarter, we made strides against piracy, as the pace of Windows unit sales outpaced the overall PC hardware market. The Company also recently signed a number of agreements to promote the use of Microsoft-licensed software with four of the leading PC OEMs serving the Chinese market. Server & Tools delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 15th consecutive quarter, as the Windows server system enjoyed broad adoption. SQL Server is a hit with businesses, growing in excess of 30% this quarter. SQL Server revenue growth continues to dramatically outpace offerings from competitors in the database market. The value proposition SQL Server 2005 offers to businesses to enable them to simply and powerfully integrate, analyze and report their data is outstanding. Customers including enterprises are increasingly selecting SQL as the database to run their most demanding workloads for mission-critical applications. Information Worker revenue grew 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in all channels. We continue to see an increased shift to our annuity offerings when customers choose to license our Office products. We attribute this to customers' desire to acquire both Office 2003 and Office 2007 upon its release later this calendar year. We have announced the Office 2007 suite line-up and pricing to customers. We have also rolled out the beta of Office Live. We have been pleased with the great response Office Live has received, with over 50,000 subscribers actively participating in the beta. MBS revenue was $216 million, which was higher than our expectations and up 21% from the prior year, driven by 28% growth in license revenues, primarily in the ERP product line. We are happy with the traction that our Dynamics ERP and CRM products are receiving in the marketplace. March marked a couple of important milestones for MBS. First, we had record turnout at our customer and partner event in Dallas, with over 5,500 customers and partners in attendance, which was over 1,000 more attendees than last year. Second, we also began our first national brand advertising campaign in a number of major publications. MSN revenue was $561 million and down 3%, with advertising growth of 7%, offset by an expected decline of 31% in narrowband access revenue. Display advertising revenue grew for the quarter, led by strong growth in advertising on our home page, instant messaging and Hotmail properties. Advertisers are finding that the critical mass of users on MSN and Live makes those properties the place they need to be. On the search advertising front, we made good progress during the quarter in transitioning our business from Yahoo!'s platform to our own platform. MSN Ad Center serviced over 70% of MSN's U.S. search traffic by the end of March, up from about 18% three months ago. Because we are still building to a critical mass of advertisers on our platforms, and we experienced lower than expected performance from partner-driven search ad pricing, revenue per search fell from the prior year's period.  Therefore, even though we experienced growth in search volumes, search ad revenue was down as we continue to transition to our proprietary ad platform, which we believe is the right business decision for the long term. We continue to make progress on delivering Live enabled services, which are aimed at enhancing the Internet experience.  During the quarter, we released five Live betas, averaging a beta release faster than every 20 days. The MED group capitalized on the growing market demand for connected devices. Broad strength across the Windows Mobile and Windows Embedded product lines led to our fourth consecutive quarter of MED revenue growth in excess of 40%. In particular, momentum behind our Windows Mobile product line continued to accelerate in the third quarter. Licenses for connected phone-enabled devices grew in excess of 85%, driven by device launches from leading manufacturing partners and mobile operators such as Palm, HTC, UTStarcom, Verizon Wireless, Cingular and T-Mobile. Also, mobile operators shipping Windows mobile-based devices increased from 93 in the prior quarter to over 115 in Q3. Xbox revenue growth of 133% drove Home & Entertainment results for the quarter. We extended our market leadership position in next-generation gaming and turned a major corner in the quarter with our Xbox 360 console supply. We are now in nearly 30 countries, and console supply is ramping significantly. The number of games available for the platform continues to increase, with 80 expected to be available by the end of June. We are seeing tremendous momentum behind our Xbox Live service. We're building on our strong early start and becoming increasingly optimistic in our console outlook for shipments. Consumer demand for Xbox 360 consoles remains very strong. Console supply increase throughout the quarter, due to improving component supplies and the addition of Celestica to Winstron and Flextronics in manufacturing. As a result, Q3 shipments of 1.7 million consoles were heavily weighted to the month of March. Attach rates remain at record levels, although revenue in the quarter was slightly below forecast, due to the back-end nature of the console sales. According to NPD, our life-to-date attach in the US through March for software and peripherals was 4.5 and 3 per console, respectively, higher than any other gaming console at this point in its lifecycle. Despite a relatively small installed base, three of the top ten selling video games in the US in March were for the Xbox 360 platform. Xbox Live momentum continues on a number of fronts. Over half of all Xbox 360 consoles sold connected to the service either through Silver or Gold tier memberships. Xbox Live Marketplace reached 10 million downloads of digital content in less than five months, and there have been over 4 million downloads from Xbox Live Arcade since launch. The momentum and success of Xbox 360 has resulted in a faster-than-expected transition to next-generation gaming. As a result, our Xbox Version 1 software revenues in the quarter continued to decline and were softer than we expected. Lastly, we extended our leadership position in IPTV software with Deutsche Telecom's announcement that it will launch its IPTV services across Germany later this year, using Microsoft IPTV Edition platform. This is our largest IPTV agreement in Europe to date and our second-largest worldwide. Now, for the rest of the income statement and the balance sheet. While revenue increased 13% during the quarter, cost of revenue increased 49%, due primarily to Xbox 360 console volumes. The majority of the variance from our forecast was driven by strong Xbox 360 unit shipments, with the rest due in higher console costs. Other operating expenses increased $427 million or 10% excluding legal charges. This was also higher than our expectations, due primarily to the following drivers. First, we invested more aggressively in our MSN business to enhance the service experience of our users, our advertisers and our partners, as well as to increase our broad collection of assets to position ourselves for monetization over the long term. We are focused on building upon our strong momentum in display advertising, making enhancements to our ad platform, improving search and augmenting physical infrastructure. Second, we increased investment in marketing and readiness programs across a number of different areas for recently launched products, as well as future product launches. This investment included global advertising and increased hiring for field sales and marketing positions, specifically and our enterprise and small and medium business sales forces. Lastly, we continue to hire aggressively in support of R&D, focused on new product development, examples of which include Longhorn Server, Exchange 12 and Communication Services. Even with these investments, if you set aside legal charges and the Home & Entertainment results, which are disproportionately impacted by negative margin console sales, you'll find that operating margins remained stable during the quarter, with operating income growth in line with revenue growth. Investment income and other totaled $427 million, and our effective tax rate was 31%. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 10.4 billion, down 5% from the prior year as the result of execution against our share repurchase program. I would like to now provide a brief summary of the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. We generated over $4.5 billion in cash from operations, a 9% decline from prior year, due primarily to the timing and magnitude of legal settlement payments. Of the over $5.8 billion returned to shareholders during the quarter, $4.9 billion was for the repurchase of 181 million shares, of which $4.7 billion doubled in the quarter. We had about $6.4 billion remaining of our $30 billion approved repurchase program at the end of the quarter. Cash and equivalents and short-term investments of $34.8 billion were up slightly from the second quarter, due to securities pledged as collateral under our securities lending program. The related balances due to the program can be seen in securities lending payable in current liabilities, largely offset by its corresponding amount in short-term investments. So, in summary, we delivered accelerating double-digit revenue growth, driven by new product momentum and healthy PC and server hardware shipments. We achieved double-digit bookings growth in our core businesses in front of a big year of product launches. Excluding the results of Home & Entertainment and legal charges, operating income grew in line with revenue, even with the big investments necessary to drive future revenue growth. We repurchased $4.9 billion in company stock, the second-largest quarterly share repurchase in company history. Chris will now provide you with our expectations for Q4 and fiscal 2007.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. So, I am going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of what we are expecting for the fourth quarter, followed by a preliminary snapshot of fiscal 2007. Please keep in mind that all of our growth figures that I will be using reflect year-over-year growth to the comparable period, unless otherwise noted. Before giving specific financial guidance, let me outline some of the key assumptions that we've used for the fourth quarter. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, PC unit growth should be 10% to 11%. Our expectations for growth in the total server hardware market remain unchanged at 11% to 13% for the full fiscal year, and we're assuming that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a major impact on our year-over-year growth rates in our forecast. Also, we continue to expect overall IT spending and our ability to participate in the marketplace to remain healthy. So for some detailed guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% to 15%. Revenue by business group is as follows. For Client, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the fourth quarter. We expect OEM units to grow roughly in line with the market, and we expect commercial and retail business growth to lag overall growth. In Server & Tools, we're raising our expected revenue growth to 17% to 18% for the fourth quarter. We expect that the strong customer acceptance of SQL Server in the last two quarters will continue in the fourth quarter. Information Worker revenue should grow 5% to 6% for the fourth quarter. We expect the increased annuity mix in our billings to continue as we move closer to the launch of Office 2007. And we will continue to look forward to releasing a broad public beta of Office 2007 this spring. For Microsoft Business Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be between 11% and 13% for the fourth quarter. Our new Dynamics products have been met with great customer and partner enthusiasm, and we look forward to carrying that momentum into Q4 and beyond. Our new Dynamics branding campaign started in March and should provide good momentum going forward. For MSN, we're expecting revenue to decline 4% to 5% for the fourth quarter. This reflects continued decreases in our access business, continued transition to Ad Center for delivering our paid search results, offset by growth in display revenue. Mobile & Embedded Devices revenue should grow between 15% and 25% for the fourth quarter, driven by the availability of new devices based on Windows Mobile 5.0. Home & Entertainment revenue is expected to grow 85% to 110% for the fourth quarter. This reflects a reduction in the implied revenue guidance we gave you in January, due primarily to lower expectations for the Xbox 1 business. We continue to see very strong demand for Xbox 360 consoles, and we are making good progress in our ability to supply that demand. Because of this increased optimism and strong console shipments in Q3, we are tightening our previously announced fiscal year shipment guidance of 4.5 to 5.5 million consoles to the top end of that range, to 5.0 million to 5.5 million consoles. Given the growing mix shift to annuity billings in front of key product launches in fiscal year '07, we are increasing our unearned guidance, and now expect unearned revenue to finish the year up 10% to 12%, up 2 percentage points from where we guided in January. We continue to estimate that our contracted not billed balance will finish the year above $9 billion. So when you combine our overall revenue growth within the net increase in unearned and contracted not billed, you'll see that we are delivering strong year-over-year booking performance for the Company in fiscal 2006. Operating income should be between $4 billion and $4.2 billion, representing 34% to 40% growth over the prior year, or 7% to 11% growth if you exclude legal charges of $756 million taken in that year-ago quarter. For fully-diluted earnings per share, we expect $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter, and expect to have an effective tax rate of 31% for quarter four. So with quarter four guidance, we arrive at the following expectations for the full fiscal year 2006: revenue between $44.0 billion to $44.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 11%; operating income of $16.6 billion  to $16.8 billion, including certain legal charges of $361 million in Q1 and $397 million in Q3. For fully-diluted GAAP earnings per share, we expect $1.22 for fiscal year '06. If you were to adjust for certain legal charges of $0.02 a share in quarter one and $0.03 a share in quarter three and the tax benefit of $0.01 a share in quarter two, earnings per share would be $1.26. The quarter four guidance is below the implied numbers we provided in January, and I would like to walk through three main drivers of the guidance change, which is split broadly evenly into the following areas. First, we will experience higher product costs in order to enable us to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles to the market as quickly as possible. We are making a strategic choice to produce and sell the maximum possible number of consoles to stretch our lead of installed base in this next generation over Sony. This will, however, cost us some income growth in the short term. In Q3, we addressed console supply challenges through securing components and improving manufacturing yields. These additional costs are not expected to continue beyond quarter four. Second, marketing partner readiness and increased hiring in our sales force for new and soon-to-be-released products will secure their success and drive momentum. These efforts are underway and will continue in quarter four and into fiscal 2007. Examples include an increased pace of Xbox 360 marketing to coincide with increased supply, working with our OEM partners on prelaunch Windows Vista readiness programs and continuing hiring of Information Worker solution specialists. Third, we intend to quicken the pace of development on businesses where we can drive growth and build meaningful share. This includes such areas as services, unified communications and collaboration, business intelligence, security and high-performance computing. We also intend to gain growth step-ups through acquisitions. We have accelerated the pace of targeted acquisitions and the associated costs are included here. In regards to services, we plan to scale global sales resources for Ad Center through the developer ad platform and increase our customer support activities to optimize the experience for our advertising partners. We will also further develop and extend our search platform. This includes not only continuing to improve relevance, but also to move into critical developing areas such as local and mobile search. We will continue to add new, significant content for our MSN and Live portals, while utilizing acquisitions to quickly fill out technology and other offerings, and increase our investments in infrastructure to ensure that we can deliver world-class performance to our customers around the world for Windows Live, MSN.com, Xbox Live and Office Live. We have been making good progress in various aspects of our services plan, such as the pace of transition to ads served by Ad Center and the continued increase in users, particularly on Hotmail and Messenger, where we added approximately 40 million Hotmail and 65 million Messenger accounts over the last year. We're delighted to have Steve Berkowitz join the team to run the online business group. Steve was recently was a CEO of Ask.com and brings to Microsoft a deep industry knowledge on how to successfully run an online business, including both search and advertising. We are looking to his contributions to help shape and drive our strategy in this space. Although we expect that the investment areas for our services plan that I highlighted earlier will defer operating profitability for MSN in fiscal year '07, they will position us to better monetize our online businesses over the long term, through building volume of both searches and page views, using Ad Center to offer advertisers a superior platform from which to coordinate their marketing efforts and building the volume of ads run through Ad Center by increasing the number of advertisers on our platform and expanding Ad Center geographically. I also want to highlight that our strategy in services is not competing against any single competitor in any one area, but to deliver value-added services across a broad array of scenarios. The online services market is clearly very competitive but has enormous potential for growth. We intend to compete in this space for the long term, and feel that our investments today will drive future success. So at this point, I would like to discuss our preliminary view of fiscal 2007 as well. Our guidance represents our best current thinking about fiscal '07, and is subject to change as we finish our planning cycle during our fourth quarter. Consistent with our past practice, we are not providing specific business group assumptions beyond our fiscal year guidance. We will provide more details, including any new initiatives, as we typically do, on our next quarterly earnings call in July and all the strategic background at our financial analyst meeting in late July. Our current fiscal 2007 revenue forecast is $49.5 billion to $50.5 billion, which represents growth of 12% to 14% over fiscal 2006, continuing the excellent '06 momentum. In absolute dollars, that represents between $5 billion in $6 billion of incremental revenue year over year. Our expectation is for operating income of $18.7 billion to $19.3 billion, and fully-diluted earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.41, representing growth of 11% to 16% on a GAAP basis. If you were to remove certain legal charges and tax benefits from our '06 numbers, fiscal 2007 EPS growth would be 8% to 12%. Now, let me outline a few key items that are necessary to understand our fiscal '07 guidance. First, at this early stage, we expect both the PC hardware market and the server hardware market growth rates to moderate from the growth rates we have seen this year. Second, we are not forecasting any significant changes in foreign exchange rates. Actual foreign exchange rate movements will cause deviations from our forecast. Third, we expect to see enterprise agreement renewal and discounting trends to be within their historical ranges. Fourth, these figures assume the launch of Windows Vista and Office 2007 to business customers before the end of the calendar year 2006, with consumer availability in January. This will be the first time since calendar year 1995 that we have had simultaneous launches of these two flagship products. We're making considerable marketing and sales investments in these launches and, to a lesser extent, the launch of Exchange 12. Fifth, we plan to continue to make significant investments that include the areas I mentioned with respect to Q4, such as continue to execute on our services vision, aggressively competing with our Xbox franchise and building new and existing business in high-growth markets. Finally, this guidance assumes we finish out the remaining $6.4 billion of our buyback program no later than December 2006. We have not built in any additional amounts beyond that. So I would like to close my prepared remarks today by putting this year into a broader context. Today, we believe we face the largest array of opportunities for growth and innovation the Company has ever seen. Software and software-driven services are playing an increasingly important role in shaping customer experiences at work and at home. Progress made in such things as high bandwidth availability, lower computer and storage costs, hardware device innovation and improvements in processing per hour provide us with the opportunity to deliver software and services that enable seamless customer experiences in the area of services, entertainment, mobility and security, just to name a few. These markets will grow quickly over the next three to five years, as will the opportunity for us to innovate and increase our income for the benefit of shareholders. We appreciate that every time we make an investment decision, it is traded between the short-term earnings and the long-term gain. However, we are willing to make those trade-offs, and believe that we have a unique opportunity at this part of the product cycle to drive substantial long-term growth. Given the level of opportunity and activity, we look forward to having a very rich discussion with you on our plans for growth at our financial analyst meeting in July. So with that, I would like to hand the call back to Colleen so we can take some of your questions. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat the instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Steve Mahedy, Banc of America Securities.\nSteve Mahedy: My question would be relative to fiscal year '07 guidance. You mentioned the moderation in the PC and server markets. Could you just give us a little detail on how you formulated the growth rates that you're assuming? And then also a tighter range on topline revenue relative to bottom-line; is there some flexibility on your spending during the course of the year, which perhaps would put us at the higher end of the EPS range?\nChris Liddell: In terms of PC market, we don't give out numbers at this stage, obviously. We have seen a moderation in the PC unit growth rate through the course of this year, so we were seeing 15% to 17% or thereabouts in quarter one, and it came down to 14% to 15% then 12% to 13%; and in the fourth quarter, as I just mentioned, we're talking about 10% to 11%. So we have seen it come off, if you like, strong mid double digits to just about double-digit rates. So we're not expecting the trend to significantly weaken from that, but we expect that moderating number that would come out of the year to be more like what we expect for next year. So that's the basis of our expectations going into the new year. In terms of the tightening of the range, to some extent it is influenced, clearly, by things like Xbox, where we could have quite a big sales variation, but not necessarily a big operating income variation, to the extent that the contribution from that business will not be as significant driving down to operating income. So that's one of the reasons why you're seeing that variation. In terms of could we see expenses there being at the top end of the range, absolutely. Those are some of the decisions that we will have to make during the course of the year and as we round out our budgeting cycle going into the fiscal year.\nSteve Mahedy: You mentioned the PC moderation is clear and you can see the correlation there. However, in contrast, in the moderating server market, it still looks like you continue to see strong results there, given the product cycle. Is there a little bit of a detachment relative to what's happening in the server market, given your ability to gain more share there?\nChris Liddell: Again, it's quite a different trend, in terms of our sales relative to the server market. This is our sales relative to the PC market. So there's a lot of moving parts in the PC market. For example, our progress on piracy, the mix shift between consumer and business, and then the other moving part is our commercial and retail sales. So all of those go into our expectation of Client revenue growth relative to PC growth. In the server market, we tend to expect our sales of underlying Windows Server to follow more closely the market. And then we have been able to and we certainly would hope to expect to be able to pick up market share in things like SQL Server.\nColleen Healy: We have been pretty consistent throughout the fiscal year thus far, expecting 11% to 13% hardware growth. The numbers directionally that we have given you for fiscal year '07, we feel, are right and it looks like in terms of third-party data, we're pretty much in line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie DiBona, Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie DiBona: I was wondering if we could maybe talk a little bit about the margin structure and some of the add-backs for this quarter? In the legal expense add back for this quarter, are you adding back a reserve you might have taken related to the European EUR2 million a day fine? And is there any build-in for that fine into your guidance?\nChris Liddell: We don't specifically comment on individual ones, but if I can put it this way, there's no change from our previous position. So there's nothing inside the legal reserve as a result of a change.\nCharlie DiBona: There is nothing inside the legal --\nChris Liddell: You asked whether there is anything in the legal reserve that results in a potential fine. All I'm saying is there's nothing in there -- there's no delta in that figure. I cannot comment on whether we had it in originally, because we don't give that level of detail out. But to the extent we did or didn't, it hasn't changed.\nCharlie DiBona: So your guidance for next year -- does it include reserving EUR2 million a day?\nChris Liddell: Same comment -- there's no change in our previous assumption.\nCharlie DiBona: So absent that, you see pretty substantial margin compression for next year, yet you have been talking about pulling forward expenses for Vista into the last couple of quarters and certainly into Q4 here. How do you reconcile those two things? It seems like you're spending fairly aggressively -- very aggressively -- through next year and not seeing leverage to your revenue acceleration.\nChris Liddell: At this stage, as you know, we're not giving business-by-business shape, so your comment is correct at the Company level. I will point back to some of our prepared remarks. Clearly, we have decided to aggressively invest in this next year in a number of areas, and they do add up. Broadly, across the areas of marketing to launch new product, so clearly with Vista and Office 2007 coming, we will be spending in that area to ensure the success of that, building on some of the other businesses in the area. So Xbox 360, we still see a big year in fiscal year '07 for that. IPTV will launch. We will have some marketing spend associated with that. Windows Mobile, we think, will potentially have a big year next year. Dynamics branding and then overall corporate advertising -- some of the work that you've seen. So that's in the new products area. In terms of new opportunities, things that we are building which will be revenue-generating beyond fiscal year '07 -- the areas, again, that I talked about in prepared -- communications, collaboration, security and management, high-performance computing and also some of acquisitions we are doing. Lastly, and we have foreshadowed this previously, the services strategy and, in particular, MSN is an area that we expect to invest aggressively next year. So you are correct. The net result of all of that, as we are guiding, will mean that we will not see an accompanying level of operating income growth equal to revenue growth. But we will still see, in our view, extremely good revenue growth. The combination of this year and next fiscal year with our guidance adds up to $10 billion to $11 billion of revenue growth. So in our view, we are investing. We appreciate we're investing aggressively relative to some of your models, but we believe it's the right thing to do, to drive what we think is extremely good growth going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from  Adam Holt, JP Morgan.\nAdam Holt: Another question on the margins, if I could. Understanding you're not giving quarterly guidance, is it safe to assume the head count adds and a lot of the marketing expenditure is going to be front-end loaded for next year? Secondly, are you making any assumptions around any kind of customer incentives during the holiday season to maybe give consumers that buy PCs Vista upgrade rights?\nChris Liddell: Sorry, I will have to give you the blanket answer that we're not going to give a lot of details about the shape of next year. I apologize for that, but that's the sort of stance. It's hard to half answer your question without doing that. If I can talk about this fiscal year, where we are giving some numbers out, clearly, we have front-ended, if you like, some of the hiring associated with some of the product development that we see in future years. I'm certainly comfortable saying that; you can see that in our head count numbers. I will comment on the positive aspect of that. There has certainly been a lot of commentary in the time that I've been at the Company about retention of people. What we are finding is we are having an extremely good time and being extremely successful in the market in hiring the people that we want. So the good news from my point of view is whilst it's a front-end cost, it's a good sign from an employment point of view. In terms of the second half of your question, about tech guarantees, we're not commenting on that. Clearly, we will look at the shape of previous releases in terms of what is a sensible thing to do for our customers and partners as we get closer to the release. But with that being nine-odd months away, we are really not commenting at this stage on exactly what we might do or when we might do it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini, UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Not to beat a dead horse here, but looking at the operating margin, is this a change in the strategy for the Company where, over the next few years, we might see revenue accelerate from these new product launches that you have talked about, but that the Company is willing to sacrifice earnings growth? I'm not just talking about fiscal year '07, but a change in strategy where you are just going to keep reinvesting back, where earnings growth is going to be below revenue growth and you're not going to get the type of margin leverage that I think people expected when the CFOs of all the different business units were put into place?\nChris Liddell: I can't give you specifics of the directional guidance for '08 and '09. I think we will talk more at the financial analyst meeting about our strategy and how that might play out. Again, if I can just talk to what we have put out today, clearly, from our point of view, we have made a strategic decision with respect to next year that, given the set of opportunities and the revenue growth potential that we see, we're willing to make that trade-off next year, and we've been willing to make the trade-off not only next year but to get ahead of it, if you like, in the third and fourth quarter as well. So you are correct in that sense. I don't want to say or extrapolate at this stage and say you can necessarily expect that in fiscal year '08 and '09. We will talk more strategically when we get together and talk about strategy in July.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund, Goldman Sachs.\nRick Sherlund: Chris, as I look at next year, the revenues look good. So I think that we collectively as analysts, have captured the opportunity for Vista okay on the revenue side. But the expenses, I've got to tell you, we're not that bad in forecasting expenses. Your expenses are about $2.4 billion more than I have estimated. I don't know if you are just not ready to talk yet about the online businesses that you're building, but I don't think Xbox mix makes that big a difference in my model. I don't think spending a couple hundred million dollars more launching products makes that big a difference. There's something like really big here that I'm not sure we have quite put our fingers on yet, but it sounds like you are building a Google or building a Yahoo! inside the Company. Ray Ozzie in this Fortune article said, this is real expensive. It's going to cost billions of dollars. I didn't know it was going to cost a couple billion dollars in '07, but that's what looks like to me. It looks more like you are kind of really ramping up your online business and the decisions been to take a lot of the benefits of the product cycle that we're going to get next year and just plow that right back into the business to kind of gear up for battle in the online market. I'm just not sure if I'm missing something, but that's the way it comes across to me.\nChris Liddell: I'm certainly happy to address that. In terms of your $2.4 billion, I probably wouldn't get to the same number as that -- I don't, obviously, have visibility into your model, but relative to the starting base of fiscal year '06. I would characterize it as being a broad-based approach across multiple fronts. I don't think there's any Trojan Horse there that we haven't talked about that is sitting below the surface that we don't want to talk about. I would say, to the extent there's a difference between your expectations of where we are coming in, I would list the sort of 12 to 15 things that I mentioned before, and we would be accelerating the pace in virtually all of those, relative to, possibly, your expectations. So there are some big numbers there; that is certainly true. And there's certainly some big potential spending and opportunities that we foresee in the MSN Windows Live area. So that is certainly true. But we're not building into our guidance things that we're not talking about.\nRick Sherlund: Are we going to talk more at the July analyst meeting about the online business?\nChris Liddell: Absolutely. Yes, that is an absolutely key and fundamental part of our strategy going forward, so yes, you can expect to hear a lot about that.\nRick Sherlund: Because there is a lot going on there. I keep hearing more about it, but we haven't really had an articulation yet of what's going on. So we should anticipate that maybe we'll have a better understanding of what's going on there at the July analyst meeting?\nChris Liddell: Yes. I'm certainly happy to take that feedback, firstly. And secondly, we had foreseen that we would spend a reasonably high proportion of the time talking about that, to the extent that it's a new area, perhaps relative to some of the other ones that you have heard about previously.\nOperator: Our next question comes from  Kash Rangan, Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Just following up on Rick's question earlier, the numbers certainly look big on that incremental expense side. I'm just curious to see if a material component of that incremental spending is from stock-based compensation? Because the times when you would publicly disclose that figure, as in fiscal '05, it was running at $2.4 billion. So should we be thinking that there is another perhaps $1 billion or maybe even $0.5 billion or so of stock-based compensation that is being factored into your operating income? Because we do hear about the enormous amounts of money being paid to hire some of the super sharp programmers in the Wall Street Journal, et cetera. So is that behind your thinking, or maybe not? If you can clarify, that will be great.\nChris Liddell: It's definitely not to do with increasing pay for the CFO, not from the billions, anyway. No, there's nothing that we are building in that is significant from a stock-based compensation point of view. We only disclose the numbers historically rather than forecast, but you shouldn't expect to be surprised there and anything new or substantial. Clearly, we are hiring a large number of people, so you will see the expense associated with those people. But you won't see huge fundamental shifts in our pay structure.\nKash Rangan: So I guess, when you report your operating income on a segment basis, we should start to see where exactly these investments are going in and how they are tracking to the way you explained the 15 different initiatives or whatnot, right?\nChris Liddell: That's correct. Yes, you will. We'll continue to try and be as transparent as possible, certainly, in retrospect.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Robert Breza, RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I'm wondering, Chris, can you talk a little bit about maybe how we should think about the shape of '07, just in terms of the product releases, knowing about the enterprise. Is there anything you can qualitatively tell us, look at the December quarter versus the March quarter?\nChris Liddell: Sorry, you just came in and out a little bit on your question there. But I got most of it, about the shape of the year. No, I'm sorry. I have to go back to what I said before, which is we are really sticking at this stage at a yearly rate. I mean, clearly, with the launches coming for business availability in December and consumer availability in January, there's going to be some implications associated with that. We're already seeing some patterns of change, for example, in our Information Worker area. We're seeing a shift from license to annuity, and that could well be in anticipation of the benefits of Office 2007. We will have some quarterly changes, almost certainly, associated with Xbox as a result of holiday season sales. So it will be some reasonably big quarterly trends that you can expect to see. But, I'm sorry, you will have to wait until July for us to give you the visibility into that.\nColleen Healy: Thank you, everybody, for your participation in today's call.

We had a very good second quarter with highlights being three extremely successful product launches, good growth in our core businesses and delivery of operating income and earnings this year in line with expectations. We have been looking forward to this quarter as we kick off the broadest multi-year product cycle in the company\u2019s history. Looking back on quarter 2, we\u2019re off to an excellent start. During the quarter we had significant on time and successful launches of products for both consumers and businesses. The quarter\u2019s new product launches created a lot of justifiable excitement in the marketplace. For example, the highly anticipated XBOX 360 had a phenomenal reception by consumers. Demand for the product has been high and we look forward to increasing the console availability in the second half of the fiscal year, with the addition of our third manufacturing partner. Just as eagerly anticipated and well-received by business customers was SQL Server 2005 and Dynamic CRM 3.0. And during the quarter, we positioned ourselves well for continued momentum and setup pipeline success with two community technology preview releases of Windows Vista, the initial Beta releases of Office 12 and Exchange 12 and many Beta versions of our Window Live Update. Our core software businesses enjoyed healthy growth, driven by strong demand from corporate customers and strong PC and Server unit segments. Growth in client revenue and a robust PC environment was driven by consumer strength during the holiday season. The real highlight for the quarter was that Server Tools continues its impressive string of double digit revenue growth. SQL Server generated over 20% of year over year revenue growth during the quarter, significantly outpacing the database market and our expectations from last quarter. SQL Server 2005 is quite simply an outstanding product, meeting the needs of customers and we were delighted to have seen the faster than expected adoption at and after the launch. We were pleased to see both business solutions and mobile and embedded devices continue their recent momentum and, in both cases, achieve operating profitability t his quarter. While we do not expect them to remain consistently for the remainder of fiscal 2006, their strong revenue and profit performance reinforces their trajectory to exit emerging status sometime in fiscal 2007. Lastly, during the quarter, we continue to have momentum on returning cash to shareholders. We announced a one cent increase in our quarterly dividend, equating to a 12 _ percent increase. And we purchased 7.7 billion dollars worth of our stock, our largest ever quarterly stock buyback. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our performance in both Q2 and the first half of fiscal 2006. So now, I\u2019d like to make a few points about how the rest of the fiscal year is shaping up. First, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2006, driven by sustained momentum in our core software businesses and by strong demand for the XBOX 360. Second, we will continue to invest in our businesses. As we mentioned on the last call, we are investing in our core businesses of client Information Worker and server tools for product launches. We will also continue to invest in MSN in order to bring rich and compelling services and content to our users and a world-class advertising platform to our advertisers. I\u2019ll discuss a little bit more about the investment in MSN later in the call. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re making the right investments for products in the near-term horizon as well as initiatives and products that will benefit us longer-term. And even with these investments, we expect to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth the second half of the year. So with those opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Scott for more details on the quarter and then I will provide you with more details on the rest of the fiscal year. Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. As Chris mentioned, Q2 is a good quarter overall, with revenues slightly below our guidance and bottom line results largely in line with our expectations. During the quarter, revenue was a record $11.8 billion up 9% from the prior year, driven by growth in our core software businesses and home entertainment. Operating income was $4.7 billion, which is at the high end of our expectations entering the quarter and driven by operating profitability in six of our seven busy seasons. We delivered good earnings growth with earnings-per-share of $.34. When adjusted for tax-rated benefits realized in the quarter of $.01 per share, this is also at the high end of our guidance. We kicked off a significant multi-year product cycle with launches of XBOX 360, SQL Server 2005, Dynamic CRM 3.0 and a host of other products. And, lastly, we returned over $8.5 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. So while revenue is slightly below our guidance, we had a successful quarter, which I will highlight over the next several minutes. I will start by discussing topline financial and business points and will follow with the revenue performance of each of the business units. Then I\u2019ll wrap up with an overview of operating income performance as well as balance sheet and cash flow information. All comparisons are meant to relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. Our core businesses had another good quarter. Overall revenue growth was driven by server and tools revenues which grew 14% on the strength of SQL sales and client revenue growth of 8%, driven by the strength of PC hardware shipments. Add in a good quarter by Information Worker, and our three largest businesses grew revenue by a combined 9%, representing $785 million in absolute revenue growth. Another key driver for the quart4r was the launch of XBOX 360 which drove home entertainment revenue growth of 13%. We\u2019re also pleased with the continued momentum in our Microsoft Business Solutions and Mobile Imbedded Business units which grew 17% and 40%, respectively. The IT spending environment was also largely in line with our expectations. The clear highlights were strong demand in the enterprise and continued strength of the PC and Server harder market growth. Demand was generally healthy across all customer segments and, from a regional perspective, EMEA and the emerging markets were relatively strong. We estimate PC market growth during the quarter at 14-15%, which is stronger than we expected 3 months ago. A very strong holiday sales season resulted in consumer PC shipment growth outpacing business shipments for the third consecutive quarter. From a form factor perspective, growth in notebook PC shipments continues to outpace desktops. PC unit demand was broad-based regionally with double-digit growth rates in all geographies, except for North America and Japan and emerging market growth rates continue to significantly outpace mature markets. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was generally consistent year-over-year with roughly 35% from OEMs, 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license-only sales and the balance from our other businesses. We had good results, overall, from a volume licensing perspective with the strongest growth in enterprise agreements, where our renewal experience remains within our historical range of 65-70%. Select and open annuity results for the quarter are also very good, relative to non-annuity licensing. Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter where we expected it, at $8.8 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter and represents an 11% increase over the prior year. The sequential change in unearned balance was impacted by the relatively small amount of multi-year contract value that was up for renewal during the quarter, relative to prior year amounts. Our contracted, not billed balance at the end of December was up sequentially and now exceeds $9 billion. Before I get into the revenue details for each business group, I\u2019d like to point out that the foreign exchange rate impact on revenue was not meaningful to our overall revenue growth. So now, let\u2019s move on to a discussion of revenue by business segment. Client revenue grew 8%, driven by OEM revenue growth of 10%, offset by a 2% decline in commercial and retail licensing. The OEM revenue growth resulted from 15% license unit growth. The different between OEM licensing growth and revenue growth is caused primarily by a shift in channel mix toward larger OEMs with volume pricing, growing volume in emerging markets, and the relative strength of the consumer segment of the PC market, which results in higher volumes of Windows XP Home Edition and Media Center Edition, relative to total units sold. As we discussed last quarter and consistent with the relative strength of the consumer segment of the market, we continue to see a change within the sales mix of our premium edition operating systems, licensed to OEMs. Our OEM premium mix is up 2 percentage points from the prior year, at 49%. A larger percentage of premium edition sales were made to consumers purchasing Windows Media Center, which carries a lower priced premium relatively to Windows Professional. All in all, we were pleased to see the significant market traction and continued growth for Windows Media Center edition, which has sold over 6.5 million licenses to date. Server Tools continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the company, reflecting broad adoption of Windows Server System products and an exceptionally strong SQL Server 2005 product launch. SQL Server 2005 provides a data management and analysis platform that enables organizations to reliably manage mission-critical information entered in complex business applications. Its business intelligence capabilities enable companies to gain greater insights from their business information. The value proposition of the product is outstanding and we\u2019re delighted to see that many customers agree. Revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. Continued share gains in the enterprise resulted in SQL Server revenue growth in excess of 20%. During the quarter, we also successfully launched digital studio 2005, BizTalk Server 2006, and Windows Server 2003R2, adding to our already strong product lineup. Our enterprise services businesses also continued to show solid progress, with revenue growth of 17%. Information Worker revenue was in line with our expectations, growth 5% to $3 billion. Revenue growth related to volume licensing and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan were strong. This quarter we experienced an increased annuity mix in our overall billings, which we attribute to customers desiring to acquire both Office 2003 and Office 12 upon its release later this calendar year. During the quarter, we also released a preview of Office 5, our future services offering targeting small businesses as well as the technical data of Office 12, which garnered positive reviews from the industry. MBS revenue was $242 million, which was higher than our expectations and up 17% from the prior year, driven by the early release of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 and strong results in EMEA. As a result of the strong revenue growth, we were pleased to see MBS achieve operating profitability in the quarter. We also shipped new versions of Dynamics GP 9.0 and Dynamics SL 6.5 during the quarter. MSN revenue was $593 million, down 2%, driven by advertising growth of 12%, offset by an expected decline of 33% in narrow-band access revenue. We are pleased with the display advertising, which grew in excess of 20% for the quarter. We improved display advertising pricing and increased our inventory while increasing the number of users of our services. Active Hotmail accounts grew to 230 million, compared to 191 million in the prior year. And, active Messenger accounts grew to 205 million, compared to the 156 million of the prior year. As you know, we\u2019re in the middle of a transition in search advertising business, moving from Yahoo\u2019s platform to our own proprietary platform called MSN Ad Center, which we began testing in the US during the quarter. The ramp-up of a new ad platform requires significant investment from Microsoft, both in development costs as well as in reduced revenues related to fewer numbers of overall advertisers and resulting lower key word pricing. The good news is that response to our platform has been great and we are ramping up deployment by rapidly envoying advertisers and moving more search traffic to the platform. On algorithmic search, we are continuing to grow query volume, improving relevance and are investing in several search verticals. We have recently launched mapping, the birds-eye flyover mapping service and are soon to launch news and images. We continue to invest in search for long term and believe there\u2019s lots of innovation yet to come. The decline in our narrow-band access revenue is in line with our expectations as customers continue to move on to broadband. MBD revenue for the quarter grew 40% on broad strength across the Windows Imbedded and Windows Mobile product lines as we continue to capitalize on growing market demand for connected devices. Windows Mobile licenses for connected phone-enabled devices grew in excess of 70% from the prior year. Windows Imbedded product growth of 64% was driven by the increasing use of Windows CE and Windows XP Imbedded in a wide range of smart devices such as point of sale terminals and thin clients. As a result of the strong revenue in the quarter, MBD also achieved it its first quarter of operating profitability. Home and entertainment revenue growth for the quarter was 13%, driven by the XBOX 360 launch and solid growth of our consumer hardware and PC games product lines. During the second quarter, XOB 360 achieved an unprecedented video game console launch, and we are thrilled with the results. We were first to market in 19 countries with XBOX 360 and have garnered record software attach rates, indicative of the strength of our games portfolio. On XBOX Live, we continue to lead the way in online gaming. Whereas, on XBOX Version 1, about one in ten customers are connected to the XBOX Live service, on XBOX 360 more than half of all consoles are connected. We\u2019re off to a strong, early start with all these factors and coupled with the continuing uncertainty of our competitors entering the next generation, we are right where we want to be. Demand for XBOX 360 consoles has been incredibly strong and feedback on the platform has been incredibly positive. Our previous challenge in the quarter was meeting the high consumer demand for the console. We sold 1.5 million XBOX 360 consoles in the 2nd quarter, with 900,000 consoles in North America, 500,000 consoles in Europe and the remainder in Japan. This is lower than we expected due to component charges stemming from challenges in ramping supply of a complex product like XBOX 360. We believe that this is a short-term manufacturing challenge and we have taken steps to increase supply to meet the strong consumer demand for the console. A key indicator of platform health is the attach rate for games and accessories. According to NPD, software attach for the XBOX 360 in the US was more than 4 per console and accessory attach was more than 3 per console for the quarter. Both are records with consumers purchasing nearly double the amount relative to any other console launch in history. The software results, in particular, highlight that we have launched XBOX 360 with an incredibly strong lineup of games. XBOX Live continues to lead the way in defining online entertainment and is regarded as the standard by which all other online gaming services will be measured. Since the launch of XBOX 360, XBOX Live members have downloaded over 4 million pieces of high definition games, music and movie content from the XBOX Live marketplace. Lastly, our XBOX Version 1 platform remains a great value to consumers. We sold over 2.2 million XBOX 1 consoles in the first half of the fiscal year, bringing the installed base to over 24 million worldwide, with 16 million in North America and 6 million in Europe. All the demand for XBOX 1 consoles and software sales was negatively impacted by the momentum and excitement surrounding the XBOX 360 launch. Now for the rest of the income statement and balance sheet. While revenue increased 9%, cost of revenue increased 19%. This increase was due to costs primarily associated with the XBOX 360 console volumes. The remainder of operating expenses increased about $750 million or 18%. As we discussed in the past, we are investing aggressively in our businesses to satisfy customers and to compete and win in the marketplace. Investments this quarter were focused around the following areas: strong levels of high end investment in research and development focused on new product development examples of which include Windows Vista, Office 12, Longhorn Server, Exchange 12, MSN Ad Center, Search and Communications Services. Advertising focused primarily on our clients and worker information businesses as well as overall corporate branding. Increased hiring for field sales and marketing positions is scored in future revenue growth. Specifically in our enterprise and small and medium businesses sales forces as well as our Information Worker specialists. And, marketing spending associated with the product launches in the quarter including SQL Server 2005 and XBOX 360. As you know, we have always taken a long-term view of our business. Today\u2019s investments in product R&D and Sales and marketing lays out the foundation for future revenue and profit growth. Investment income in other totally $400 million including $212 in net gains on investments and $185 in net losses on derivatives, primarily related to losses on foreign exchange contracts and commodity positions. Our effective tax rate for eh quarter was about 29%; lower than expected due to a $108 million tax benefit associated with the settlement of state audits. Now for a brief summary of the cash flow statement and balance sheet. We generated over $2.2 billion in cash from operations, a 38% decline from prior year due to increased spending on XBOX 360 inventory and other changes in the working capital. Of the over $8.5 billion returned to shareholders during the quarter, $7.7 billion was for the repurchase of 283 million shares, with the remainder for dividends. During the quarter our board of directors also announced a $.01 increase in the regularly quarterly dividend; bringing it to $.09 per share, per quarter. Cash and equivalents in short term investments were down $5.4 billion and 13% sequentially for the first quarter, to $34.7 billion, reflective of the record amount of share repurchase activity in the second quarter. So in summary, we achieved record revenue of 9% growth driven by our core businesses, representing over $1 billion in absolute revenue growth versus the prior year. We will continue to invest to fuel revenue and profit growth in the future. Our earning per share was at the high end of our expectations, excluding tax benefits for the quarter. We executed on key product launches kicking off a significant, multi-year product cycle and we repurchased our stock at record levels. With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our expectations for Q3 and the rest of fiscal 2006. Thanks, Scott. As some of you may know, Scott\u2019s in the process of transitioning into his new role as the head of the OEM group. Microsoft OEM Channel is obviously critical to the company\u2019s success and we look forward to his contributions there. I\u2019d certainly personally like to take this opportunity to thank Scott for all of his hard work and dedication in driving functional excellence across finance. Moving into his new role will allow Scott to continue forward in his already substantial impact here at Microsoft. However, I\u2019m sure he will also dearly miss joining us here on these quarterly calls. Now I\u2019m going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of what we are expecting for the third quarter and the rest of the full fiscal year. Please keep in mind that all of the gross figures that I am using reflect year-over-year grow to comparable period, unless otherwise noted. Before giving specific financial guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions around the economy and general demand in the industry. With calendar 2006 underway, we expect overall IT spending to remain healthy in the new year. We feel good about our ability to participate in any growth in the overall marketplace in the coming year. We estimate for the 3rd Quarter PC unit growth should be 11-13%, primarily as a result of higher than expected growth in the first half of fiscal 2006, we are raising our full fiscal year estimate to 12-14%. Our expectation is that growth from the total server hardware market remain unchanged at 11-13% for the full fiscal year. For our forecast, we\u2019re assuming that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a material impact on our year over year growth rates. So now for some detailed guidance. For the full year, we\u2019re tightening the revenue range that we gave you in October, as we now expect revenues to come in between $44.0 and $44.5 billion, representing growth of 11-12%. We\u2019re forecasting the Q2 strength in our core software businesses to continue into the second half. For the 3rd quarter we expect revenue up $10.9-$11.2 billion, representing year over year growth of 13-16%. Revenue by business group is as follows: For client, expect revenue growth to be 7-8% for the full fiscal year and 7-9% for the third quarter. We expect OEM units to grow roughly in line with the market, aided by growing traction in emerging markets. In server and tools we\u2019re raising our expected revenue growth to 15-16% for the full fiscal year and 15-17% for the third quarter. We are forecasting continued corporate demand for our server products with SQL Server 2005 continuing to show strong market acceptance. Information Worker revenue should grow 5-6% for the full fiscal year and 6-7% for the 3rd quarter. As we move closer to the launch of Office 12, we expect corporate customers to increasingly prefer annuity licensing programs when evaluating Office purchases. For Microsoft Business Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be 14-15% for the full fiscal year and approximately 16% for the 3rd quarter. Demand for our new Dynamic CRM 3.0 has been above our expectations and we\u2019re forecasting the recent strength to continue through the 2nd half. For MSN, we\u2019re expecting revenue to be flat for both the full fiscal year and the 3rd quarter, which reflects slightly lower revenue expectations for this business in fiscal 2006, driven primarily by our plans to accelerate the rate at which we ramp up Ad Center to deliver our paid search results. While this is an important strategic decision for the long-term, it does have a dampening effect on revenue for search in the short term. Additionally, as I spoke about earlier in the call, we will also be making additional investments to strengthen the competitive position of our internet services. Areas of investment include for example, global infrastructure, where we are investing in global infrastructure in order to provide high quality performance and reliability for our customers on a global basis. In Ad Center, we\u2019ll be hiring a thousand support people to provide great end-to-end service for our advertising customers, investing in development talent to increase the range of functionality for advertisers, and thus increasing their ROI, increasing traffic to Ad Center to speed the transition from Yahoo\u2019s network and finally, rolling out Ad Center to more countries globally, to provide end to end advertising solutions to our customers everywhere. In Search, we\u2019re investing in search verticals by increased development resources and via acquisitions. For example, we bought GeoTango, which is a 3D internet visualization technology company, to enhance Windows Live Local Search. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re making good investments for products on the near term horizon as well as for initiatives and products that will benefit us longer term. Mobile and Embedded devices revenue should grow greater than 30% for the year and about 35% for the 3rd quarter, driven by a number of exciting new devices, based on Windows Mobile 5.0. Home and Entertainment revenue is expected to growth between 35% and 45% for the year and between 80% and 100% for the 3rd quarter, which reflects a reduction of the revenue guidance that we gave you in October, primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, lower expectations for the XBOX 1 business as the moment around XBOX 360 has drawn some attention away from the previous platform. We expect to continue to sell the XBOX 1 console well into the calendar year 2006 and certainly see this as a stretching out of the sales cycle. There are 800 games currently available for the platform and we expect there will continue to be a great deal of new content from third party publishers in the coming years. Second, we have slightly slower expectations for our consumer hardware, software and PC games business. We\u2019ve also lowered our estimate of XBOX 360 console sales in the first 90 days of launch from 2.75 \u2013 3 million units to 2.5 million units due to supply constraints. Even so, we estimate that consumers will spend over $1.5 billion in total retail value on XBOX 360 consoles, games and peripherals in these first 90 days, which is indicative of the health and magnitude of the XBOX 360 launch. As you know, we\u2019re bringing on a third manufacturing partner, Salistica, next month to help in meeting strong consumer demand for the XBOX 360 console. For that reason, we are not adjusting our previously announced fiscal year console sales guidance of 4.5-5.5 million consoles and our revenue guidance, which is based on unit sales within that range. We continue to expect great software sales for XBOX 360, resulting from a strong flow of new games for the platform over the coming months. By the end of June, XBOX 360 will have more than 50 high definition games from the best names in publishing. We delivered an unprecedented global launch during the quarter and by the end of March, XBOX 360 will be available in nearly 30 countries and will remain on track to be the fastest selling video game console in history. Operating income for the full fiscal year is expected to be between $17.9 billion and $18.3 billion, representing growth of 23-25%. Brief note, this full year guidance includes the charge we took in Q1 of $361 for the settlement of Real Networks. Before significant settlement and other such items, operating income for the full fiscal year is expected to be $18.3-$18.6 billion, representing double-digit growth of 10-12%. For the 3rd quarter, operating income should be $4.5-$4.6 billion, representing 36-39% growth over the prior year or 11-13% growth if you exclude the $768 million settlement charge taken a year ago to quarter. For diluted earnings per share, we\u2019re tightening the range that we gave you in October by raising the low end of that by $.01. The range is $1.28-$1.31 for the full fiscal year on a GAAP basis. If you were to adjust for the Real Networks settlement charge of $.02 from the first quarter and the $.01 tax benefit in the 2nd quarter, earnings per share will be $1.29-$1.32. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $.32-$.33 for the 3rd quarter and expect to have an effective tax rate of 31% for the 3rd quarter and the remainder of the year. On the balance sheet, we\u2019re still expecting unearned revenue to finish the year up 8-10%, and it\u2019s likely to be at the higher end of that range. We\u2019re also raising our estimate on our contract and our billed balance to now finish the year above $9 billion. This is up from our prior guidance of finishing the year at $8 billion. When you combine our overall revenue growth with the net increase in unearned and contracted not billed, you\u2019ll find that our year over year booking performance for the company for fiscal 2006 is strong and we feel confident about how we will end the year. So in closing, I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m pleased with our 2nd quarter and our fiscal year \u201906 performance on three counts; first, the customer reaction to our newly launched products has been fantastic. Second, our ability to deliver our products on time, which \u2013 given the style and complexity of our product range \u2013 reflects a great performance and an increasingly improved operational discipline. And last, we made our expense targets for the quarter. With that, I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Colleen so we can take some of your questions. Thank you. Thank you Chris. Let\u2019s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many of you as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions? Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1. To withdraw your request, you may press star 2. Once again, to ask a question, please press star followed by 1. Our first question comes from Adam Holt with JP Morgan. Good afternoon. Two questions on the unearned commentary. To get to the higher end of the 8-10% growth for the year, when would you expect to start to see an acceleration in the Information Worker bookings in front of office? And secondly, can you talk about some of the things that you\u2019re doing to try and accelerate client bookings as well, particularly with Vista enterprise? We do actually have quite a large number of contracts that are maturing and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we feel confident about the balance being at the high end of that range. The first half of the year was a relatively modest period for expires and the second half is a relatively high one. On the Information Worker side we\u2019re actually already starting to see what we think is a shift away from fully-priced products to the enterprise side. So, we\u2019re starting to see that impact already and we believe that will continue through the first half of this calendar year, second half of the fiscal year. On the client side\u2026what was the question about client? What other number of initiatives in place to try and drive long term contracts on the client side in the context of the Vista release? I was hoping you could update us on that and also talk about when we would expect to see that acceleration. We haven\u2019t built in the expectations on the enterprise side for the 2nd half. We certainly think we\u2019ll start to see some year on year benefits as the calendar year proceeds and as we get closer to the Vista launch. We are seeing some benefits, for example, in the new software assurance product that we launched last year. So, as opposed to a declining trend that we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters, that\u2019s flattened out and it will improve but we haven\u2019t built a lot of that into our expectations for the 2nd half of the fiscal year. Thank you. Thank you very much, Adam. Next question please? Thank you, our next question comes from Rick Sherland with Goldman Sachs. Thanks. Just first on a technicality\u2026can you reconcile why the cash flow statement shows $7.4 billion of stock repurchase and you\u2019re saying $7.7 billion in the text? What\u2019s going on there Rick is that not all of the buy-back fell within the quarter. So, the difference that you\u2019re seeing is inter-quarter settlement. We\u2019ll catch that up next quarter when it\u2019s settled. Okay. And the constraints on supply for XBOX 360, if you could just talk for a moment about that. Could you be more specific with us about what that is? It doesn\u2019t seem that if it\u2019s a supply constraint that adding Salistica necessarily helps that. If you can kind of add some clarity there. As we said in our prepared remarks, we had some issues with some of the components. There\u2019s nothing that we think is systematic to the extent that we\u2019ve solved some of them or will be solving any that we haven\u2019t resolved, in the short term. So, it\u2019s not a constraint that we see that\u2019s going to be significant going forward. Let me just reiterate, in terms of the volatility that we can expect in the first few weeks with a product of that significance, launched across 90 countries, loss is at the low end of our expectations and it\u2019s not surprising from our perspective; we don\u2019t think this is a significant issue for the first six months. Thank you so much, Rick. Next question please? Thank you. Our next question comes from Charly DiBono with Sanford Bernstein. Hi. Can we turn to MSN for a second here? It looks like your search ads are slightly down year on year and basically flat sequentially. You talked a little bit about the impact that Ad Center\u2019s having on your pricing, does that mean that in areas where you\u2019re not Beta testing Ad Center that you\u2019re not seeing any deterioration in search pricing? And then, what has your experience been in France and Singapore as you\u2019ve gone live with the product? Are you seeing a recovery in pricing there? And a related question would be, what are you doing so that the deteriorating leverage you\u2019re getting on your community in your partner ads? I\u2019ll take those in parts, Charlie. In terms of the Beta test thing, no there isn\u2019t a positive impact from that. In fact, as we initially ramp up because the volumes are lower than what they are on the combined Microsoft/Yahoo platform, we actually see a deterioration in the pricing. That will take some time as we need to ramp up the critical mass and volume. So that has a negative impact. In terms of the expectations that we had of receptivity, that\u2019s going in fact better than we had hoped for which is one of the reasons why we\u2019re accelerating the ramp up. But it does have a negative impact. In terms of the overture of pricing, no I don\u2019t believe we saw a deterioration of pricing on the non-Ad Center-based ads during the quarter. But as we\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility in there, so the trends that we are seeing, unfortunately is something that is opaque to us. One of the reasons why we\u2019re moving faster on Ad Center and taking control of our own destiny. And what about the partner network where you\u2019ve seen some deterioration as well? It\u2019s not significant in my mind, from a financial point of view. So I\u2019m not entirely sure what you\u2019re referring to from a numbers point of view, but there\u2019s nothing systematical. You mentioned it in your MDNA. The partner issue is the partner-driven prices. So that\u2019s the same question as overture. What we\u2019re seeing a bit is for the partner-driven\u2026in other words, the parts that we don\u2019t control our own fate on, we\u2019re seeing pricing pressure which surprises us a bit. We\u2019re going to take our fate into our own hands and we\u2019re going to ramp up ad center. Given that we\u2019re ramping that up, we probably don\u2019t have tons of life left on these partner-driven prices; it sort of is what it is and we\u2019re sort of focused on making our Ad Center platform best-in-class. Thank you. You\u2019re welcome. Next question please? Thank you. Our next question comes from Mary Meeker with Morgan Stanley. Thanks. I have a quick question; I think Brian may have one as well. Chris, for the last couple of quarters you\u2019ve had very strong PC unit growth but client revenue growth has not been as strong. You drilled down all the reasons for that, emerging markets, mix, etc. But the delta is large, is this the kind of delta we should just expect on a go-forward basis as we go through our modeling? I think you can realistically expect if not all that delta then some large part of it for the rest of this fiscal year. You take our guidance on PC unit growth and on revenue, that\u2019s the delta that we expect based on those mix factors. Going into fiscal year \u201907, I don\u2019t know if you want to get into forecasting that at this stage, but we would certainly see for example fully-priced packaged product sales being different in our launch year with something like Vista, so that impact which is being measured would be something that would be different. Do you think we could narrow it to something like a 300 basis-point difference? To some extent, we\u2019re already seeing in the quarter some narrowing. If you remember sort of last year we were down sort of mid- to high teens on commercial retail. We did see some narrowing this quarter, we\u2019re down 2%. If you look at our guidance on the back half, it continues to narrow in terms of where we think the PC market is coming and where our revenue is coming and hopefully that\u2019s some sort of indication about our expectations. Okay that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Mary, the other factor is it depends a little on the absolute size of the PC growth. So as it gets larger, it\u2019s tending to come from the consumer area which is tending to make it get bigger. So in a year where the PC growth was say lower, you might expect the gap, all things being equal, to be narrower. Just a quick question to follow up on the 360. Are you still on target for the 4.5-5.5 million consoles by June? I know you put down a number of 4.25. Yes, we are still on target in that range. Great, thanks. Next question, please? Thank you our next question comes from Heather Bolidi with UBS. Hi, thank you. I just wanted to follow up to Mary\u2019s last question. I was wondering if at some point if Skeet Balmer said there\u2019s a mix to higher-end SKUs, could you see the fact that the consumer is making the gap bigger right now as he just mentioned? Do you see that change with Vista in the big uptake of things such as Media Center with PC edition? And I guess the follow up would be there\u2019s some concern in the market that Vista might not make it out for the 2006 holiday season. Is there any update you could provide for us on that? Thank you. From our perspective we\u2019ll still talking about Vista launching in the 2nd half of this calendar year so, nothing\u2019s changed there. In terms of the swing in mix, we are seeing inside the consumer side of things a positive mix swing. For example, as you mentioned Media Center, so that is helping. But on the other side, in terms of emerging markets, and the growth that\u2019s there relative to mature markets, if like a negative mix we have a lot of price points in those. So there\u2019s a number of moving parts. But in terms of the consumer, consumer side of mature markets, we definitely see Media Center traction and that is helping us. I just want to make sure. I\u2019d like to add to that\u2026going back to our financial analyst\u2019s meeting we have made some general comments about SKUs and having more differentiation within our SKU strategy, what you\u2019re seeing for example with the SQL Server 2005 launch is we had 4 different SKUS, took the high end up, had a nice lower end SKU. In terms of software assurance announcements, Heather, you\u2019ve heard us talk about Vista enterprise edition available to customers. So I think what you can expect to see and what you\u2019re beginning to see from us is differentiation within our SKUs. Great. Thank you. Next question please? Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangdan with Merrill Lynch. Hi, thank you very much. I was just wondering given that you\u2019re seeing better attach rates with the XBOX 360 and the software component makes it look richer versus your prior expectation, why would that not be even a little bit more profitable to the degree that you might want to reconsider where you stand on BPS guidance on the positive side? That\u2019s it, thanks. Kash, we want to be sure we understand the question there. Can you just repeat it? With better than expected attach rates for the game cartridge for the XBOX 360, and if you\u2019re maintaining your forecast for unit shipments, it sounds like the high margin software component of the total revenues should be a positive that you might consider revising your APS forecast for fiscal 2006 on the upward side. Thank you. Offsetting that to some extent is the XBOX 1 sales and the software associated with that and also HRB revenue in each of the segments. To the extent that they are profitable elements and we\u2019re lowering those, then that has an offsetting impact. And Kash, we\u2019re just thrilled to see the unprecedented attach rate with the game console. Keep in mind that at this point it\u2019s really the hard core enthusiasts that are getting involved in midnight madness. They may be more inclined to take the extra game, the extra peripherals. We want to be nice and conservative there and not necessarily forecast that too aggressively. The other thing, Kash, is outside of the FCB segment, as Scott mentioned in prepared remarks, we are making some investments in MSN and Ad Center and some of the impacts of the small acquisitions that we\u2019re doing in that area, for example GeoTango. So, that is also offsetting \u2013 from an operating income point of view \u2013 some of the other benefits. Got it. Finally, in unearned revenue you talked about 8-10% growth in fiscal 2006; it looks like it\u2019s growing actually north of that. The last 3 quarters it has been 12-13% so, is it just conservatism as you head into a product transition or anything else behind that forecast? Yes, quite often on a quarter-by-quarter basis, relatively big swings depending on the seasonality and the expiration pattern.  So, the 8-10% is just how we see it year on year, given what we see in the 2nd half. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s more significant than that. Thanks. Thanks so much Kash. We only have time for 2-3 more questions. The next question please, operator? Thank you, the next question comes from Brent Phillips with Prudential. Thank you. Chris, you mentioned that CRM 3.0 was exceeding expectations. Are there any metrics to back up the success of that product in the market that you gave out with SQL Server 2005? Just the revenue growth inside the overall segment. I don\u2019t know if we split up the CRM in terms of growth, coming off such a low base, it was an extremely high number and I don\u2019t think it will \u2026 it was triple digits, from memory. I\u2019m not sure it will give you a good indicator. But in terms of actual dollars, it was just extremely well-received. And, if I could put it this way, the reason for the out performance in that particular segment, it was virtually all CRM, so that\u2019s one way in order of magnitude form it. Just to follow up to Heather\u2019s question around Vista, you\u2019re saying second half of the year; is there any more granularity. Will it make it in the back-to-school segment or should we expect a late \u201906 ship? At this stage, we really aren\u2019t saying anything more than what we previously hit. Obviously, in the next quarterly call that we have in April we\u2019ll foreshadow \u201907 and we\u2019ll certainly be happy to talk about it at that stage. Fantastic, next question please? Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Maynard from Credit Suisse First Boston. Hi, good afternoon. Given your interest in AOL, could you maybe talk from a corporate development perspective how you\u2019re thinking about MSN and some of the other sort of advertising related businesses around that market? Outside of the investment that you\u2019re making, obviously, in building better  and whatnot? I don\u2019t want to obviously speculate on anything having to do with acquisitions. I think Steve has spoken quite openly and I certainly talked on previous calls on our willingness to consider acquisitions as a way of fueling growth. We have been doing a recently significant number of them. In fact we\u2019ve been announcing roughly one a month. They\u2019re small to medium-sized and to a large extent that\u2019s the ones that we think really give us good value for our money. And, we certainly expect to continue to do some of that. But in terms of speculating on larger transactions or their impact on particular businesses, that\u2019s not something I really want to do. That\u2019s fair. Maybe just any color you can give us on the composition of the strength of your SQL Server, like geography or if you can give a little detail on where you saw the\u2026 Very broad-based really. It didn\u2019t peak in any particular area or any particular segment. It was just incredibly well received across the board. Thank you. Thanks so much. We have time for one final question, operator. Thank you, our next question comes from David Hiller with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Great, thanks. Kind of a follow up to the Ad Center questions. Outside of France and Singapore, what are the milestones you have for launching Ad Center? Can you give us any specific dates or rough dates for the rest of this calendar year in terms of deployment of Ad Center? Thanks. In the US I believe we have around 15-20% of our ads served in the US through Ad Center and trending towards 25%. I\u2019m not sure I want to say there\u2019s a particular date, but certainly by spring of this year I would say we\u2019d expect the bulk of our US business to go through Ad Center. Thank you. Fantastic. Thanks so much everyone for joining us today.

Thanks for joining us today. I'll start today's call with highlights from last fiscal year's performance and then give you an overview of our expectations for fiscal 2008. Our quarter 4 performance capped an extremely strong year for our company, and helped set the stage for fiscal 2008 to be another year of double-digit revenue, operating income and earnings per share growth. I'm extremely pleased with the traction our sales force and partners are experiencing with business customers, evidenced by billings growth in the quarter for enterprise agreements in excess of 25%, and non-annuity licensing up of over 15%. When you combine those figures with billings for OEM and packaged products each growing 10% plus in the quarter, you'll see that demand was strong across all of our channels and customers. Looking at our full year results, fiscal 2007 was a year of $7 billion of revenue growth, fueled by robust customer acceptance of products in both our emerging and mature businesses including Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2007, SQL Server, Windows Server, and Xbox 360 consoles. Our core businesses accounted for $5 billion of absolute revenue growth, with the business division, client, and server and tools growing 13%, 14% and 16%, respectively for the year. Operating income for the year also grew double-digits. We were able to achieve this while still be being able to make a number of significant investments in our businesses. For example, the launch of over 40 new products into the marketplace, as well as a number of updates and enhancements to our online service offerings, continued development of a number of upcoming products such as new versions of Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio, the enhancement of our online service infrastructure by continuing to refine adCenter; increasing our database capacity; and necessary investments in Xbox customer satisfaction. We also announced eight strategic acquisitions including: aQuantive, to provide the advertising industry with a world-class, Internet-wide advertising platform; Tellme, for its voice response services; and Softricity for its application virtualization and streaming capabilities. Earnings for the year came in at $1.42, up 18% over last year, which was faster than both revenue and operating income. Finally, during fiscal \u201807 we made significant progress on our strategy of returning cash to shareholders. Last year at this time we announced authorization for programs to repurchase up to $40 billion worth of our stock over five years. Today, one year after that announcement, I am happy to say that we have passed the halfway mark on the program by repurchasing approximately $25 billion worth of our stock during the year. When you combine the share repurchases we made this year with the $3.8 billion worth of dividends paid, we returned about 175% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Now I would like to move to our outlook for fiscal \u201808. Given the good exit from fiscal \u201807 we are increasing our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for next year on an absolute basis. We expect revenue growth of 11% to 13%, with operating income and earnings per share growing even faster than that. I'm particularly pleased that the high end of our guidance reflects each of our businesses growing revenue at double-digit rates for the year, especially given our robust performance in fiscal \u201807. Looking to our product lineup in \u201808, next year represents another significant launch year for the company. We will intensify our pursuit of important market opportunities for the company with product launches in business intelligence, unified communications, security and business applications. By the time we exit next year, we will have refreshed a major portion of our server lineup within a period of 15 months with the addition of new versions of Windows Server and SQL. Additionally, the consumers will have a great lineup of first and third-party games heading into the holidays, led by the release of Halo 3, plus continuing enhancements to our Windows Live services. With those high level themes for 2007 and 2008, I am going to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on how we closed out last year.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, the fourth quarter delivered a strong finish to the year with revenue near the high end of our guidance provided on the April earnings call. Specifically, demand for our offerings was excellent, with revenue growing 13% and core bookings increasing over 20%, characterized by high annuity revenue growth, driven by outstanding field sales force execution on enterprise agreement renewals. This speaks not only to the healthy customer acceptance of the products recently launched, but also to the anticipation of our offerings still to come. Let me provide you with details of our financial performance, starting with revenue. I'll discuss top line, financial and business momentum points, and then follow-up with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I'll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. As I mentioned, revenue grew 13% to $13.4 billion, driven by client, the Microsoft business division and server and tools. Online services also had a good quarter. Each of these four businesses grew in the mid to high teens, and collectively at 16%. The underlying PC hardware market remained robust, with estimated growth of 11% to 13% during the quarter, about a point higher than our expectations. PC shipment growth rates in emerging markets continue to outpace that of mature markets, and consumer PC shipment growth outpaced that of the Business Segment. Every region, except the US and Japan, increased PC shipments at double-digit rates. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, over 40% from multi-year licensing agreements, around 15% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Over the past couple of years we have seen a mix shift from license-only sales to annuity agreements, driven by standing adoption of enterprise agreements. Enterprise agreement renewal rates exceeded the high end of our historical range of 66% to 75%. We are delighted that the value proposition from our current product lineup and future roadmap -- beyond the recently launched flagship desktop product even -- are resonating with customers. This strong annuity licensing performance drove our unearned revenue balance 16% higher to $12.6 billion and our contracted, not billed balance was driven higher on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, exceeding $10 billion at the end of June. As a result, total bookings grew over 15%, and core bookings of client, Microsoft business division and server and tools increased over 20%, as I previously mentioned. I'll close out the revenue overview by adding that changes in foreign exchange rates added about 2 percentage points to our overall revenue growth. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment. Client revenue grew 14% to $3.8 billion, characterized by strong OEM revenue growth, driven by continued demand for Windows Vista and a healthy PC hardware market. OEM revenue increased 15% and includes 3 points of revenue recognition from undelivered elements. Adjusting for this impact, OEM revenue grew roughly in line with OEM unit shipments at 11%. OEM premium mix was 72%, a 17 percentage point increase over this period last year. This was driven by a 20 percentage point increase in the consumer element of premium mix, and around a 3 percentage point decline in the business element. Given the over 5:1 pricing uplift we received from the business premium SKUs over consumer premium SKUs, these changes within the premium mix have largely an offsetting impact to revenue. For further background on this new disclosure, we have included a slide in the earnings deck on our website that illustrates these metrics, as well as lists of SKUs comprising each of the consumer and business premium mixes. Client, commercial and retail licensing increased 7%. Businesses are recognizing the value that Windows Vista and Software Assurance provides them, as evidenced by high renewal and new annuity attach rates, driving about a 25% increase in the volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. Server and tools revenue grew 15% to $3.1 billion, driven by SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio and consulting services revenue. Fiscal 2007 capped a decade of consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth for SQL Server. During the quarter, significant product development momentum was achieved with beta releases of the upcoming versions of Windows Server and Visual Studio, and a community technology preview of SQL Server 2008. In our online services business we saw advertising revenue growth of 33%, exceeding our expectations. Search ad revenue benefited from both increased search queries and revenue per search, while display ad revenue enjoyed both increased number of page views and revenue per page view. Overall, online services business revenue grew 19% to $688 million. Microsoft business division revenue grew 19% to $4.6 billion, beating high end guidance by over $150 million. Highlights in the quarter included solid revenue growth through enterprise agreements for Office, and continued momentum for Share Point. Enterprise agreement momentum continued after the launch of the Office 2007 system, and renewal rates are higher now than they were a year ago. We are also pleased with the results of our Dynamic business, which showed healthy performance across both the ERP and CRM product lines, driving a 24% increase in dynamic customer billings. An impressive 85,000 new seats of our dynamic CRM offering were sold during the quarter. Consistent with our guidance, entertainment and devices revenues decreased 10% to $1.2 billion as a result of lower Xbox 360 sales. Software and accessory attach rates remained at record levels, and we passed the 7 million member mark for Xbox Live. During the quarter, Halo 3 concluded beta testing, and on September 25th will lead the charge of hotly anticipated game titles into this 2007 holiday season. Entertainment and devices achieved its goal of selling over 1 million Zune units on a sell-in basis in its first eight months in the market. Licenses for Windows Mobile-based phones grew in excess of 75% to end the year with sales of over $11 million, and an increased unit market share in the smart phone category. Now for the rest of the income statement. Positive revenue increased 52%, primarily driven by a charge relating to the current and enhanced Xbox 360 warranty policies that were announced earlier this month. At this time, let me provide you with the details of that charge, now that they have been finalized. First, the total amount was $1.06 billion, within the range we provided a couple of weeks ago. Second, the makeup is largely consistent with the guidance we provided with about half of the total charge driven by existing warranty policies and the other half driven by the new warranty enhancements. Of the total amount of the charge, approximately 35% is attributable to inventory valuation adjustment. Before the Xbox 360 charge, cost of revenue would have increased 5% year over year. Other operating expenses increased 13%, excluding legal charges of $351 million in the year-ago period. Expense growth was driven by headcount-related costs and sales support cost for our enterprise software advisory channel partners. Operating income was $4 billion. Excluding the impact of the Xbox 360 charge and certain legal charges in the year-ago period, operating income for the quarter would have increased 19% to $5 billion. Investment income and other totaled $295 million for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29% to align to our annual effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 2007. Before non-recurring items the effective tax rate for the year would have been 31%. Cash flow from operations increased 34% to $4.4 billion. During the quarter we repurchased 243 million shares, or $7.4 billion of company stock, of which $7.2 billion settled in the quarter. We paid out $952 million in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.7 billion, down 6% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.31, which included $0.08 related to the Xbox charge. Before this charge, earnings would have been $0.39 per share. So in summary, during the quarter we made a needed investment into our Xbox business to assure customers that we fully stand behind our products. Before this charge, the fourth quarter was a strong end to fiscal 2007 with double-digit revenue, operating income and EPS growth, robust bookings and solid progress on the fiscal 2008 product pipeline. With that, let me turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with our expectations for the first quarter and all of fiscal 2008.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see for the full year ahead and first quarter. Before we get into the specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. The fiscal 2008 forecast generally assumed a continuation of the economic conditions and demand from where we exited in 2007. Our forecast did not include any significant unexpected impacts from foreign exchange rate movements. We expect PC unit demand to continue to remain healthy with growth rates similar to what we saw in 2007. Specifically, we expect PC unit growth for fiscal 2008 to be 9% to 11% for the year and between 11% to 13% for the first quarter. We estimate that growth rates will continue to be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment, and recent regional trends should continue with growth in emerging markets outpacing that of mature markets. Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the full year we expect our revenue to come in between $56.8 billion to $57.8 billion, growing 11% to 13%. This represents a 1 percentage point improvement on the high-end and is about $300 million better in absolute dollar terms from our April guidance. The $5.7 billion to $6.7 billion yearly represents yearly increases driven by expected solid performance across our five segments. In the first quarter, we expect revenue of $12.4 billion to $12.6 billion, which represents an increase of 15% to 17%. With that revenue guidance in our divisions is as follows: For client, we expect full year growth to be 9% to 10%, and quarter one growth to being 15% to 16%. For the first quarter we expect OEM revenue to grow faster than the PC hardware market due to a higher premium mix than the year-ago quarter and to be in line for the full year. On the commercial and retail side of the business, we expect double-digit growth for both quarter one and the year from continued demand through our volume licensing channels. Combined growth rate benefits by 3 percentage points in Q1 and 2 percentage points for the full year from recognition of undelivered elements. As in our April call, we have included a slide in our slide deck containing additional information on the impact of client revenue. Server and tools revenue should be 14% to 15% for the year and 11% to 12% for the first quarter. Coming off another impressive year in fiscal 2007, Server and tools is expected to again achieve double-digit revenue growth, while delivering the next wave of server innovation with the upcoming February launch of the new versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and Visual Studio. Together, these products form a highly reliable and secure next-generation enterprise platform, which will fuel growth in the server and tools business over the next several years. We forecast revenue in the online services business to increase 10% to 13% for the year and 10% to 11% in Q1. This implies advertising growth in excess of 20% for the year and for the quarter. Fiscal 2008 will bring many important structural enhancements to our online services business. First, we expect to close both of our recently announced acquisitions for ScreenTonic and aQuantive in the first quarter. These acquisitions represent important next steps as we continue building out our vision of a centralized advertising platform that allows advertisers exposure across the various IP-enabled media. Second, we will be making usability improvements by providing better integration between our Windows Live services. Third, we will continue to build out our data centers to provide capacity for online services that can be used across the company. I mentioned our acquisition of aQuantive, and I want to clarify that the guidance we are giving you for the company and for OSB does not include the financial impact of aQuantive. We expect to close the aQuantive acquisition in August, sometime after the shareholder vote. Assuming a positive vote and a subsequent close, we plan to update our corporate guidance for the inclusion of that business on our next earnings call in October. As we stated in May, the transaction will have revenue and operating expenses, but we do not expect a significant affect to fiscal 2008 operating income and earnings per share, excluding transaction costs. Microsoft business division revenue should be 11% to 12% for the year and 14% to 15% in the first quarter. Q1 will continue to benefit from strong customer acceptance of the Microsoft Office system. Fiscal 2008 represents another important launch year for the business division, with the impending releases of Office Communications Server, Performance Point Server and a new versions of Dynamic CRM. These products continue Microsoft's push into the field of unified communications, business intelligence and business applications. While overall revenue growth remained healthy, direct comparisons for the second half of 2008 are more difficult due to our out performance in 2007. For the entertainment and devices division, we're forecasting revenue growth of 10% to 19% for the full year and 30% to 40% for Q1. Growth in our most profitable revenue streams will be a key driver in achieving our goal of segment profitability in fiscal 2008. We had the best first and third-party software title lineup we have ever had, highlighted by the launch of Halo 3 this September. These games, combined with Xbox accessory attach and an expanding line of Xbox LIVE installed base, set us up for an excellent year in our Xbox business. 2008 will be another year of continued momentum for our mobile communications business as well. We expect to sell over 20 million licenses for Windows Mobile-based phone as our carrier and OEM partners roll out a broad and compelling lineup of devices based on Windows Mobile 6. Getting back to companywide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between $22.2 billion and $22.7 billion, increasing 20% to 22% and 12% to 15%, excluding certain charges in fiscal 2007. The higher revenue forecast is responsible for the improvement versus our April operating income guidance. For the first quarter, we expect operating income to be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion. As a result of the higher operating income guidance, we have increased our full year earnings per share results by $0.01. Therefore diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $1.69 to $1.73. For the first quarter we expect $0.38 to $0.40. These earnings assume an effective tax rate of 30.5%. From a balance sheet prospective, we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2008 up 7% to 10%. Excluding undelivered elements, the remaining portion of our unearned revenue should increase 13% to 16%. Contracted not billed should also finish 2008 up from current levels. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from quarter four 2007 to quarter one 2008, we expect the sequential decrease from the fourth quarter to be about 10%, due to the large amount of billings in that fourth quarter. When thinking about the guidance we just provided you, I would suggest that you consider some of the risks. These risks include competitive, legal, execution and general market risks, as well as customer acceptance of our new and existing products and fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between and annuity and license-only can have an impact on GAAP revenue, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. So to wrap up, fiscal 2007 was an excellent year from my perspective. Launches of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office System, Exchange 2007, Zune, and Windows Mobile 6 have brought new capabilities into the marketplace so it is exciting to see them off to such strong starts. Many of the same factors that helped us be successful in 2007, such as a healthy PC hardware market, customer acceptance of our new versions of Office and Windows, an impressive lineup of new product offerings, as well as solid execution by our R&D and sales and marketing teams will help propel us into the next fiscal year. In \u201808 we're looking to deliver another year of double-digit revenue, operating income and earnings per share growth. Next year product releases represent significant improvements over our existing products, as well as a continued push into new areas for the company. Given the operational backdrop and our ability to generate meaningful free cash flow for the company, we will look to continue to execute on our strategy of returning cash to shareholders. This brings me to the end of my financial comments. I'm very much looking forward to catching up with many of you at our financial analyst meeting next week. As a result of your feedback, we have made some slight adjustments to the overall flow of the day. There will still be presentations by Bill, Steve and the senior management team, but we have also allowed more executive interactions than in prior years, with Q&A sessions throughout the day with all the speakers. We have left some time now for your questions. I will hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Great. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourselves to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie DiBona: Thank you, operator. Chris, I guess it will come as no surprise that I have a question about the online services group. I know you promised more metrics next week, but more generally, you have had some solid results here and a good recovery of search share by all the independent metrics in the last month, both sequentially and year over year. But there has been some speculation that those gains were driven by special programs. Now your Q1 guidance points to a relatively significant deceleration of that business. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy here and about the sustainability of particularly last month's momentum?\nChris Liddell: Yes. Let me talk about the quarter and then how it flows through to the year. From the quarter point of view, the underlying advertising revenue was up 33%. The good news from my perspective was that really it was across the board. So we had good search volumes, we had good monetization of those search volumes. We are lapping the transition to adCenter so we're getting some benefit, if you like, from revenue per search uplift, as well as the overall volumes. Better than that growth rate is also on our display business, which doesn't tend to get talked about as much. That was up a healthy number in terms of volume and monetization as well, so it was a good quarter all around. Vis-a-vis next year, inside the guidance is revenue growth in advertising of greater than 20%. Now the comparables start to get harder because we're off a bigger base, obviously, and we don't have for the full year quite as strong a momentum in terms of the adCenter transition. I would just say mid 20s or higher is a good result for the business overall. I think that clearly if we can do better than that, that's great, but that's not a bad result. In terms of the last part of your question on how much we were assisted in the fourth quarter by some of the one-off impacts, we were certainly helped by that but I think the interesting thing from my point of view is not necessarily the sustainability of that because that was one or two months. It\u2019s just that when we put a new product into the marketplace, it is capable of shifting share. I am certainly not going to extrapolate that through next year but I think it is interesting from, if you like, an experiment point of view that when we try something different, we were able to get some movement in the market in a relatively short period of time. I haven\u2019t built a lot of that into next year and we\u2019ll wait to see other more sustainable products have some influence but overall, I think next year, having revenue of advertising growing at greater than 20% off a higher base is at least a good starting point at this stage.\nColleen Healy: Thank you, Charlie. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Thanks, Chris and Colleen. I was wondering if you could comment on two things; one, where do you think the premium mix could go? It went from 71, I believe to 72 this quarter. Again, that\u2019s much higher than what you had forecasted before you went into the Vista cycle but where do you think we could go, especially as we get into the heart of consumer spending maybe more around back to school and holiday? Also, could you comment on the significance of SP1 for Vista adoption? Do you have any comments on timing? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: With the premium mix, we think that sort of level is sustainable through next year, so we would expect the same sort of premium mix next year as for this year. We will see a difference in business premium versus consumer premium. As we talked about last quarter, we thought we would give you more visibility into what\u2019s happening in those two different segments or those two different components of the premium mix because they have such different monetization impact, the business premium having much more significance than the consumer premium. Colin shared with you the makeup of those numbers. In terms of next year, because we expect consumer growth to be higher than business growth in terms of PCs, we would still expect a mix shift in the premium segment towards the consumer premium but the overall premium mix for the company to be relatively healthy and high in the 70 odd percent range. So we think it\u2019s sustainable at that level but with a change inside business and consumer. In terms of SP1, clearly there will be an SP1 but it looks like we\u2019re not talking about exactly when that is. We don\u2019t see it as a massive driver of uptake in its own right. It\u2019s early days yet and we are broadly happy with how we are seeing Vista adoption, both from a consumer and a business point of view. We were always expecting, and I think we talked about this for the last two or three quarters, that the business uptake would be driven by their needs rather than the availability of Vista per se, so that\u2019s going to be progressive over the next 12 to 18 months and I think will be relatively independent of when the first service pack comes out.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Heather. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSara Friar: Good afternoon, guys. In the entertainment and device area, that guidance for fiscal year \u201908 is quite a wide spread. Chris, could you just talk us through what the major swing factors will be? Also, you did say the profitability of the segment for FY08 but can you give us any sense on timing? Could Halo 3 launching at the end of September help drive profitability as early as December?\nChris Liddell: It\u2019s profitability overall for the year and that\u2019s the key from my point of view. Because of the seasonality in that business, you could see some quite different swings in profitability on a quarter by quarter basis, not only because of Halo that you mentioned but obviously the Christmas quarter is a substantial one from a console and gaming point of view. So it won\u2019t necessarily be a linear improvement during the course of the year, although in terms of COGS it will help. The COGS will progressively degrade through the year but the volumes will go up and down with the quarter. So profitability overall for the year but it will be non-linear in the way that it rolls out during the course of the year. In terms of the width of the guidance, I guess that is purposeful. It\u2019s one of those businesses which, from a demand point of view, is relatively hard to anticipate. Obviously console demand in itself is a big variable there but the other thing and better than that, to be honest, we have a pricing strategy for the next 12 to 24 months that\u2019s embedded in that and a console strategy as well, and those two are related to each other. At this stage, we\u2019re keeping relatively quiet about that from a competitive point of view. We really don\u2019t want to signal anything, so that will become more clear as the year comes through. But at this stage we\u2019re keeping, if you like, a relatively wide range to accommodate that.\nSara Friar: Could I ask one more quick follow-up? On the macro environment, a number of other tech and others have alluded to a much better spending backdrop. I would just love to hear your quick thoughts on any changes you are seeing in the various geographic areas, where you are seeing strength and weakness.\nChris Liddell: We are certainly seeing strength in all of the emerging markets. For example, countries like Russia which has just had a phenomenal year for us, so some of those Eastern Europe countries, South America and obviously the Asian countries are very strong form our perspective, albeit off a relatively small basis. In terms of overall level of spending, we aren\u2019t seeing a significant positive there. The thing that we believe that we are seeing is a higher share of the wallet from some of our customers and that\u2019s reflected in the relatively higher renewals that we are getting and people\u2019s uptake of the products. So from our fields point of view, we are seeing a really healthy and encouraging trend from just being a desktop software provider to being much more of an infrastructure provider to enterprises. So we aren\u2019t necessarily seeing the amount of their spending going up but we believe that the amount that they are spending with us on the suite of products that we\u2019ve got, not only the ones obviously that we\u2019ve launched in the last couple of years but the ones that are coming up, is increasing in what we consider to be a promising way.\nSara Friar: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Sara. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Chris, on the client guidance for fiscal \u201908, it seems it\u2019s fairly prudent considering the industry is expecting a reacceleration in PC unit growth for the second-half of this year. Can you just talk to some of the characteristics and why you are expecting that line to slow down more than any of the other lines that you\u2019ve given guidance for the year?\nChris Liddell: If you start with PC unit growth rates, and that\u2019s clearly the main driver inside there, we are expecting for next year, as I mentioned on the call, around 9% to 11%, so we\u2019re sticking pretty much in line with industry expectations. We think we can grow OEM units at the top end of that range because of our continued progress that we make in piracy, so we think we can grow units at the top end of that range. And then we\u2019ll be assisted to some extent by the Vista revenue recognition that we talked about on the last couple of calls. But because of the premium mix change, and this is something that Steve obviously alluded to in February and we talked a bit about on the last few calls, we will lose a couple of percentage points between OEM unit growth and OEM revenue growth, you know, the strong drive in emerging markets, growth in emerging markets, and consumers will take a little bit of a shaving relative from revenue relative to units. Lastly, from our perspective in terms of revenue growth, the commercial and retail will have a strong comparable in FY07, so the growth rate will be relatively hard to repeat, given the FTP spike that we had in fiscal year \u201907. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in the way that we look at it, but if you start with PC unit growth, we think we can grow OEM units at the top end of that and we think we can grow client revenue overall broadly equal to OEM units at around that 9% to 10% mark. So we think that will be a good healthy result from our perspective, but in order to get out-performance on that, we\u2019d have to see PC units at stronger levels than that.\nBrent Thill: Just a quick follow-up; Longhorn is still on track for a calendar year \u201907 ship?\nColleen Healy: No update on the Longhorn. You can expect second-half calendar \u201907 for RTM.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Brent. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Bear Stearns.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. I have a question, Chris, on cash flow. It looks like other current assets are down a little bit and there\u2019s a note right at the end of the press release, or the report on your website. I just want to make sure I understood it. It looks like this year relative to a year ago benefited by about $1.2 billion because you were not building X-Box inventory, so just I guess confirm that that\u2019s actually true. We know that you had some channel issues where there was an over supply to the channel in the December quarter, but this 35% of that $1 billion charge due to inventory valuation adjustments, is this at all related to that? What exactly are you adjusting here? I mean, does that in any way allude to what you were talking about as far as your pricing strategy going forward or do you have to go in and fix all these things? And does that have to do with the three flashing light issue or just any issue? Sorry for such a long one there.\nChris Liddell: Let me try and strike all the components and hopefully I get them all. In terms of the cash flow impact, yes, there is a difference between our billed inventory a year ago and a declining inventory situation this year, so that is certainly true from a cash flow point of view. In terms of the write-down component of the charge associated with X-Box, that is a write-down on the balance sheet of the holding costs of those X-Box, so that\u2019s a non-cash charge clearly but it does have an influence on the overall carrying costs of the boxes that are associated with that, a direct charge to that. In terms of the linkage between that and the three flashing red lights, it is not so much a direct linkage. There\u2019s obviously an indirect linkage in the sense that because of that, as people return them we need to repair them, but this is very much, the inventory write-down is very much a write-down of the inventory that we have had returned to date that we believe that we will not be able to sell as a repaired unit, and hence it\u2019s impaired from a valuation perspective. It is clearly all part of the same manufacturing issue but it is slightly different from a physical and hence an accounting perspective. Did I grab all the parts to your question?\nJohn DiFucci: I think you did but one of the things here with this write-down and some of those other components, other 15% -- I\u2019m having a hard time understanding why this is like a special charge and it\u2019s taken out of this non-GAAP, the non-GAAP numbers for you.\nChris Liddell: I think the important thing from my point of view is the visibility of what we did and what we tried to do a couple of weeks ago -- I\u2019d be happy to go over it again -- is give people all of the components of the charge and what they were and then obviously people can treat them as they see appropriate. I think the important thing is that they relate effectively to boxes that have already been produced, so have been produced in the fiscal year \u201906 or fiscal year \u201907 area. From a GAAP point of view, it is clearly a charge and the important thing from my perspective is that people understand the magnitude of the charge and the major components of it in terms of what they -- what people can expect in the future will be a cash cost and what is simply an accounting charge against balance sheet items now. So people, depending on whether they are looking at cash flow as it sounds like you are or balance sheet or overall GAAP accounting, they\u2019ve got hopefully all the major components to slice and dice the way they want to.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks a lot, Chris.\nColleen Healy: Thank you, John. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Holt with JP Morgan.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. I have two questions about expenses and operating margins. You had relatively significant growth in headcount related expenses, both in the quarter as well as for the year. Could you talk a little bit about what we should expect for headcount growth as we look into next year? Secondly, if you look at the midpoint of the guidance for next year, you\u2019re looking at maybe 60, 70 basis points of operating margin expansion year on year. How should we think about your strategy or your medium term margin expansion goals say over the next several years? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: We\u2019ll talk more extensively in terms of years other than next year at FAM, so if I can leave the longer term picture until then and then talk to last year and this year and hopefully that will give you some flavor. In terms of headcount growth, from my point of view, the good trend that we are seeing is a slowing of the headcount growth so I am certainly keen to see us grow from lower rates of headcount growth than we have seen in the last couple of years. We got down on a year-on-year basis in the last quarter to around 10%. Now that\u2019s still relatively high but relative to our level of revenue growth. I\u2019m much more comfortable with that than the mid-teen levels that we were seeing six to 12 months ago. Headcount growth is in a better shape than it has been from my perspective. In terms of next year, embedded inside the guidance, as you can imagine, is both headcount growth and cost per head at those more moderated levels. That is going to vary quite differently between the different divisions, though. For example, we are building headcount in our online business and headcount is relatively flat in our client business, so you are seeing quite different trends in where the heads are being added, adding up to the overall picture. It\u2019s a little similar comment to the margin structure. From my perspective in terms of margins, I think of the business in three parts. There\u2019s our core businesses of client, MBD and server and tools, and next year collectively you should expect their margins to be broadly equal to this year, which I think is a good result when you see what the growth rates are inherent in those businesses. You see EDD moving to profitability, so clearly that\u2019s a margin improvement but obviously still being very much in the investment phase, so it will be in a loss position and hence a negative margin next year and some of the improvement that we are making in EDD effectively we are reinvesting in [OSD]. But net overall, as you say, midpoint of the guidance will be a slight improvement in margins next year and I\u2019ll talk a little bit more next week about how I feel overall for margins longer term.\nAdam Holt: Great. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Adam. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Credit Suisse.\nJason Maynard: Good afternoon. Chris, client and server and tools both came in a little bit lower than your guidance range. I was just curious if you would attribute that maybe to the stronger-than-expected strength in the EAs, or if you think some of the chatter around the timing of SP1 might have had an impact? Or any commentary on what virtualization is doing to the server market?\nChris Liddell: Client was very much in line with our guidance. It might have been a shave off and to the extent that the Vista revenue recognition was a little lower than what we had indicated, but that was in the $20 million to $30 million category. Other than that, it was very much in line. Server and tools, you are correct, was a little light and was for the reasons that you mentioned, that we had a very strong annuity mix of revenue inside server and tools which helped us obviously from an un-earned perspective. That\u2019s one of the reasons why our unearned was so strong and also one of the reasons consequently why we flowed that through the higher revenues the next year. But in the quarter, it hurts us in the sense that when we ship license only that we recognize all up front to annuity that we recognize over the length of the contract, we don\u2019t get quite as much of a pop. That was the principal reason why server and tools was at the light end of what we guided.\nJason Maynard: Maybe just a follow-up on that then; when you take into consideration your guidance around unearned for next year, are you assuming more normal historical type of EA mix rates or do you think it is going to continue on this path that you saw in Q4?\nChris Liddell: I think it could well continue. I think that the really interesting trend underlying this and the strength of the product suite and offering that we have to customers and their desire and willingness to stay on enterprise agreements for all sorts of reasons. Firstly, obviously the product that we have; secondly, the ones that we have coming out; and people clearly focused on Vista and Office as the big products that we\u2019ve launched but when you look at next year, which most people would not have thought was a big launch year and you think of new versions of Visual Studio, new versions of Window Server, new versions of SQL Server. You have Performance Point, our business intelligence coming out. CRM Live. There\u2019s a lot of different products that are appealing from a customer point of view and staying on annuity also helps them from an administration and cost perspective. I think there\u2019s lots of good reasons to think that we are seeing a potentially more sustainable trend on annuity mix, which hurts us a little bit in terms of up-front revenue recognition but in terms of the overall health of the business, is very positive from my perspective.\nJason Maynard: Thank you. Very helpful.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Jason. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much, Chris and Colleen. Just an observation; I\u2019m just looking to get your explanation behind this -- the rev rec positive change to the client business seems to have changed relative to your earlier guidance. In looking at the presentation, it says $540 million. The previous guidance was for $660 million of positive change in the rev rec. Does that mean that you've made any changes in your assumptions of Vista relative to XP in your mix for fiscal 2008 client guidance? As it relates to that, maybe if you could comment on, Chris, how are you seeing adoption of Vista in the enterprise? Because it occurs to me that I think you have given us a very neat explanation as to how you get to the client guidance. You have parsed out different elements. But the one piece that could be a swing factor is the business adoption seems like if we get better business adoption going into 2008, you might have a positive swing factor. I just was wondering if you had any comments on what kind of update we should expect that could cause the business premium mix to shift towards the positive. So it is really a two-part question there. Sorry about that.\nChris Liddell: I'll cover both of them, if I can. In terms of the unearned, you're absolutely right. As we went from target seating, which we do around the March timeframe, the budgeting which we did last month, we fine-tuned the Vista/XP mix for next year. We changed it from 85% to 78%. Now it's a lower number, but it's still a very high number overall from our perspective, so 78% Vista mix in terms of sales next year. Because of that change, then the amount of undelivered element that comes from Vista is slightly lower than it would be otherwise. The underlying sales are still exactly the same, but that accounting impact, as you correctly say, decreases from $660 million to $540 million. So from our point of view, it's good that our outlook has pretty much exactly the same revenue overall, but the composition as a result of the accounting recognition is slightly different. In terms of the adoption from business, that is a slightly different parameter. Obviously, those two are linked to each other. It's early days here, We are seeing what we consider to be good customer response. But the next 12 to 18 months is really going to be the time when people are going to be looking seriously to roll it out. Looking out at the first stage we think it's early days, but it's good. Could there be some upside there if we see businesses adopt it? Not necessarily earlier, but have a refresh cycle which is a bit stronger than it is and hence we get a bit more business premium relative to customer premium? Yes. That's not so much a rollout then because we tend to get paid either way for XP or Vista, but it could help with the overall premium mix that I talked about a few minutes ago.\nKash Rangan: That's the fiscal 2008 forecast, right?\nChris Liddell: Correct, yes.\nKash Rangan: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Kirk Materne - Banc of America.\nKirk Materne: This is a little bit of a follow-up on Kash's question. Chris, on the business premium mix can you give us an idea of what is in your forecast? It seems that your assumptions for the actual unit side of the business are pretty conservative in light of what you all have seen. Have you made any assumptions in terms of the premium mix getting better? I think it was down 3% this quarter. Is that forecasted to get a little better as we head into fiscal '08 or are you assuming it stays at the same rate? And if it does get better that is upside to what you are looking for?\nChris Liddell: In terms of the overall premium mix, I'd say it's going to be in line with fiscal year 2007, which was 68% for the year. So plus or minus a percent here or there, I think it's going to be broadly in line next year with what it was this year. As we have with our forecasts, and clearly external ones may differ, in terms of the business and consumer mix we would see business premium being down slightly and consumer premium being up, so it's the same trend that we saw this year. That's entirely driven by the fact that we expect the consumer segment to grow faster than the business segment, so therefore by definition the percentage will increase in favor relative to the customers. That could change around a bit. We're relatively conservative, I think, on business growth overall, but I think it's appropriately conservative. We are seeing consumer sales consistently outpacing business sales for a number of years now, and I think that's the right starting place. Now obviously I would love to see some upside there, to the extent that we get a good price for business premium, but we have built in what I think is an appropriate mix going forward.\nKirk Materne: Maybe just one follow-up on that. In terms of the business premium, is there any gating factors from say a technology or cost standpoint, meaning I think the enterprise edition comes along with Software Assurance. Is there anything structurally that's keeping people from going to a higher premium mix on the business side, or is it simply just an adoption issue?\nChris Liddell: Well, you have two impacts. Consumers tend to buy consumer, and businesses tend to buy business SKUs. So you've got that mix impact. Inside businesses, there's nothing structurally which is stopping them from buying one particular SKU or another. You are right, the Software Assurance gets you the enterprises edition, which most large businesses would favor. But it's about the features; it's not about the technology that probably drives the decision as to which SKU to take.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Kirk.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. With that, let me now turn it over to Chris.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We're going to use our prepared remarks this afternoon to share our third quarter results, discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter, and provide a preliminary view of fiscal 2008. I'm extremely pleased with the company's financial performance during the quarter, as revenue, operating income and earnings per share exceeded our expectations and each grew at strong double-digit rates. Our results were primarily driven by strength in our core products. Windows Vista and 2007 Microsoft Office System will have a multi-year impact, and both are off to a very good start. Revenue growth in the third quarter was 32% and even if you were to exclude the $1.7 billion in recognition of previously deferred revenue associated predominately with our Technology Guarantee Programs for Windows and Office, our revenue growth would have been an extremely good 17%. Four of our five businesses delivered double-digit growth and we saw forward strength across all customer segments and channels. Excluding $0.01 in legal charges and a $0.02 tax benefit in the quarter, the revenue upside flowed through to operating income and earnings per share, which came in at $0.03 to $0.04 higher than our guidance in January. Cash flow from operations was also over $7 billion, indicative of the underlying strength of our business, and was a record for the company. Lastly, we continue to execute on our financial strategy. During the quarter we repurchased over $6.7 billion in company stock, and paid out just under $1 billion in dividends. This brings combined year-to-date repurchases and dividends to over $22.5 billion, which represents over 150% of our cash flow from operations over that same period. Moving now to the full fiscal year, we expect a strong finish to what has been an excellent year. We are increasing our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year on the strength of our new product launches. Excluding certain legal charges and tax benefits in the prior and current years, we expect revenue growth in excess of 15% and earnings per share growth in excess of 16%. For both high level themes for the quarter and for the full year 2007, I'm going to turn the call over to Colleen for more details on our third quarter performance.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, the results for Q3 were excellent. Let me provide you with details on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points, and then follow-up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. Revenue for the quarter grew 32% to $14.4 billion, which includes $1.7 billion in recognition primarily from the Technology Guarantee Program. Excluding the recognition of these deferrals, revenue growth would have been 17%. Growth this quarter was driven by sales in our Client and Microsoft Business Division, following the general availability of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System in January. Server and Tools had another solid quarter. These three core businesses turned in notable performance, each growing at a double-digit rate, and collectively growing revenues 22%, or over $2 billion in absolute growth before the recognition of the Tech Guarantees. We saw continued strength in the underlying PC hardware market, which we estimate grew 10% to 12% during the quarter, a bit faster than we had expected. Growth in emerging markets continues to outpace that of mature markets, and the consumer PC shipment growth outpaced business shipments. Europe, Asia excluding Japan and Latin America maintained double-digit growth rates, while the remaining regions grew at single-digits. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, over 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, over 20% from license only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. The mix this quarter versus the same period in the prior year is higher in license only sales, primarily due to retail sales following the consumer launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System, and lower in our other businesses due to our core product making up a higher mix of revenue this quarter, as you would expect given where we are in our various product lifecycles. Our field sales force saw broad strength across our customer segments and regions. Our small, midmarket and retail sales group actively engaged with our customers and partners, readying the market for the product launches. The entertainment sales force drove robust volume license sales, and entertainment and enterprise agreements renewal rates at the high end of our historical range of 66% to 75%. We are delighted that the benefits and value proposition offered in the recent releases of our flagship products are resonating with customers. As a result of a strong annuity licensing results, our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at $10.3 billion, up 16% over the same period in the prior year. Our contracted not billed balance at the end of March was sequentially higher and continues to exceed $9.5 billion. Taking into account reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted not billed balances, bookings growth totaled 20%, with bookings in our core business of Client, Microsoft Business Division and Server and Tools growing 25%. Before closing out the revenue overview, let me add that changes in foreign exchange rates added about 2 percentage points to our overall revenue growth rate in the quarter, and was generally in line with our expectations going into the quarter. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment. Client revenue of $5.3 billion, an increase of 67%, includes the recognition of $1.2 billion from Tech Guarantees and pre-shipments. Adjusting for this impact, Client revenue would have been $4.1 billion, up 30%, driven by growth in all channels due to the successful consumer launches of Windows Vista during the quarter. OEM revenue increased 24%, excluding the recognition of the Tech Guarantee deferrals, driven by 20% growth in OEM license units. The 8 to 10 point difference between OEM license unit growth and the overall PC market growth during the quarter is a result of a normal spike in license sales on the launch of a new operating system in our system builder channel, restocking of retail inventory levels by OEMs as a result of the consumer launch, and continued progress on unlicensed PCs under our existing program. Consistent with the results we saw last quarter and the relative strength in the Consumer segment following the launch, we continue to see a change within the mix of sales of our Premium Edition operating system. OEM Premium mix was 71%, an increase of 18 percentage points from the prior year, driven by sales of Windows Vista Home Premium, while our other business editions of Windows declined a few points in the overall mix. As we shared with you previously, Windows Vista business generates over five times the pricing of our Windows Vista Home Basic and of Windows Vista Home Premium. So the net result is that the increase in Premium mix added about 1 percentage point of growth to OEM revenue. Client, commercial and retail licensing grew 63%, excluding the recognition of pre-launch revenue deferrals, driven by strong sales to the retail channel following the consumer launch of Windows Vista and a very healthy commercial business. Server and Tools revenue of $2.7 billion grew 15%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Windows Server, SQL Server and Visual Studio, as well as growth in our consulting and Premier services. Also, during the quarter we launched Systems Center Operations Manager 2007, which provides end-to-end management for the monitoring and reporting of Windows environments. In our Online Services business we saw continued improvement in our advertising platform monetization, which resulted in advertising revenue growth of 23%. Revenue for our Online Services business overall increased 11% to $6.2 million, driven by the growth in advertising revenue, partially offset by an expected decline in access revenue. Search revenue benefited from a higher number of search queries, and increased revenue per search on both a year on year and consequential basis. We are now monetizing more effectively in the U.S. on our own Ad Center platform than we had under third-party Overture at this time last year. Our display growth was in line with what is a healthy market, driven by an increase in page views. This quarter we forged content partnerships with Newscorp, NBC and CBS to enhance MSN's premium video inventory. Microsoft Business Division revenue of $4.8 billion grew 34%, or 20% after adjusting for the Tech Guarantee. Growth was driven by both consumer and business sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system following the recent launches. The performance for the quarter was highlighted by a strong consumer response to the 2007 Microsoft Office system, which drove better than expected retail sales. We are also pleased with the results of our Dynamics business which showed healthy performance across both the ERP and CRM product lines, driving a 20% increase in customer billing. During the quarter we announced plans to acquire TellMe Networks, bringing this industry-leading expertise and voice services to our existing speech platform and unified communications offering. Consistent with our guidance, Entertainment and Devices revenue decreased 21% as a result of lower Xbox 360 sales. We sold over 5,000 Xbox 360 consoles during the quarter, bringing our life-to-date sell-in to approximately $11 million. Software and accessory attach rates remain at record levels in the U.S. per MPV, and we have passed the 6 million member mark for Xbox Live. Our Mobile and Embedded Devices business continued to turn in strong performance, with revenue growth in excess of 30%. During the quarter we unveiled Windows Mobile 6, the next version of our Windows Mobile software platform. We expect to see an increasing number of Windows Mobile 6 powered devices coming to market through the rest of this year. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased 6%, primarily driven by data center costs, product costs associated with the launch of Windows Vista, and the growth in consulting services, partially offset by a decline in Xbox 360 console sales. Other operating expenses increased $928 million, or 20%, excluding legal charges of $154 million in the current quarter and $397 million in the same quarter from the prior year. This is favorable to our expectations, due primarily to shifting some marketing and product development costs into the fourth quarter. Operating income of $6.6 billion, or $5.1 billion after adjusting for the impact of the Tech Guarantee deferrals and legal charges, is up 18% from the prior year, driven by the 22% revenue growth in our core businesses of Client, Microsoft Business Division, and Server and Tools. Investment income and other totaled $382 million for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29%, and was lower than expected due to a $195 million one-time tax benefit. Cash flow from operations increased 60% to $7.3 billion. During the quarter we repurchased 237 million shares, or $6.7 billion of company stock, and paid out $976 million in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.9 billion, down 5% from the prior year as a result of execution against our share repurchase program. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50, which includes the following non-recurring items: $0.12 related to the impact of the Tech Guarantees, a tax benefit of $0.02 offset by $0.01 in legal charges. So in summary, the third quarter broadly exceeded our expectations, driven by the extremely positive consumer response to the launches of our flagship products. With that, let me now turn it back to Chris, who will now provide you with our expectations for the fourth quarter and a preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2008.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. Let me now outline some key assumptions that we have used in putting together the outlook for the fourth quarter. Firstly, we estimate that PC unit growth for the quarter will be 10% to 12%. Within the overall PC market we expect current trends to continue, with a consumer segment growth exceeding that of the business segment, and emerging market growth exceeding that of mature markets. In contrast, third party analysts have lowered their full year server hardware growth estimate to 4% to 6% and although Server and Tools revenue is impacted by many additional factors, we have incorporated that into our guidance. Lastly, our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that changes in foreign exchange rates will not have a significant impact on revenue growth rates for the quarter. So now for our detailed guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue of $13.1 billion to $13.4 billion, growing 11% to 14%. Revenue guidance by business group is largely consistent with what we provided in January and so in the interested time I will simply provide you with the numbers. For Client we expect revenue growth of 14% to 15% for the fourth quarter. For Server and Tools, 16% to 17%. For Online Services, 10% to 15%, although excluding access subscription and transactions revenue, this implies advertising growth of 19% to 27%. For Microsoft Business Division, 13% to 14%. Finally, Entertainment and Devices revenue is expected to be down 2% to 11% in the fourth quarter. Now moving on to operating income. For the fourth quarter we expect to generate between $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion of operating income, representing 28% to 33% growth over the prior year. Well, 17% to 22% when legal charges of $351 million from the year-ago quarter are excluded. This was lower than the implied guidance from January due primarily to two factors. The first is a shift in operating expenses from the third quarter, as our full year total remains consistent with what we said in January. The second is higher COGS related to Xbox console and Windows Vista retail sales. We now estimate a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 31.5% due to a greater mix of forecasted earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. For diluted earnings per share, we expect $0.37 to $0.39 for the fourth quarter. So with that fourth quarter guidance we arrive at the following expectations for the fiscal year. Revenue between $50.9 billion and $51.2 billion, representing growth of 15% to 16%. Operating income of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, or excluding certain legal charges, $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, representing growth of 12% to 13% and for fully diluted earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.50 or adjusting for certain legal charges and tax benefits, $1.47 to $1.49, and representing growth of 16% to 17%. We are clearly pleased that our strong performance in Q3 has allowed us to raise our revenue, operating income and earnings per share estimates for the full year. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect unearned revenue to finish the year up 8% to 10%, an increase of 2 percentage points from our January guidance. This increase reflects our growing confidence in multi-year contract billings in Q4, where the revenue opportunity and undoubtedly risk, is the largest we have seen in two years. The deal pipeline is robust. The value proposition for multi-year contracts are strong and the product portfolio is broad and deep. With that, let's turn to our fiscal year '08 preliminary outlook. As is always the case at this time of year, we are providing you with our first look at the next fiscal year prior to finalizing our internal budgeting and planning process. Reflecting where we are in the planning cycle and consistent with our past practice, we're not currently in a position to give specific business group detail. I should also highlight that this guidance provides you with a view that balances both the risks and opportunities as we currently see them. For context, our expectations are based on a stable IT spending environment. 2007 IT spending has been generally healthy and although we may see softening in select areas such as server hardware growth, we're not expecting any significant changes on a regional basis in fiscal 2008. Also, we're not modeling any significant impact to year-over-year revenue growth from changes in foreign exchange rates. The continuous product innovation we have been stressing for two years is driving our expected growth and our product cycle continues in the next 12 months with the launches of, for example, Longhorn Server, the next version of our CRM software and live CRM service, Halo 3, the next version of Visual Studio, new Windows Live Search and Communication Services, Office Communications Server, Expressions Studio, Office Performance Point Server, Forefront Client Security, and many other products and services from across the company. We expect our product line ought to generate revenue of $56.5 billion to $57.5 billion in fiscal '08, representing growth of 11% to 12%. On an absolute basis, this translates into an increase of over $5.5 billion, an amount larger than the total annual revenue of some Fortune 500 companies. As we have previewed with you since October, this guidance reflects the requirements for Windows Vista revenue recognition, which results in a relatively faster revenue recognition as compared to Windows XP, where we have stood at 5% to 25% of license revenue. We are committed to transparency on this, so I would like to provide you with our revenue guidance adjusted for the impact of Windows Vista revenue recognition. We have included slide 20 in our earnings slide deck, which provide you with detail on the associated underlying balance sheet and P&L adjustments. Had we never deferred some delivered elements on Windows XP sales, our expected accounting revenue would be approximately $220 million lower in fiscal '07 and $660 million lower in fiscal '08. These figures represent the near annual amount of revenue we expect to recognize from the undelivered elements accounts on the balance sheet. From a year-over-year growth perspective, this impact represents approximately half a percentage point of consolidated corporate revenue growth in fiscal '07, and approximately 1 percentage point of consolidated corporate revenue growth in fiscal '08. Applied specifically to the Client business in fiscal '08, we expect a 3 percentage point impact in year-over-year Client revenue growth as a result of the Windows Vista revenue recognition methodology. Of course, the magnitude of revenue impact varies with the underlying sales mix between Windows Vista and Windows XP. Our fiscal '08 guidance numbers assume a unit mix of 85% Windows Vista, and 15% Windows XP. The amount of impact we have highlighted today could differ materially to the extent that transition to Windows Vista from Windows XP differs from our forecast. In other words, the faster the transition to Windows Vista, the bigger and more positive the impact will be in fiscal '08. While on the subject of Client revenue, we recognize there's a lot of interest in our outlook for fiscal '08. Although we won't be providing specific Client business guidance on the call today, I would like to briefly provide you with some directional expectations. For your convenience, we have laid these out for you on slide 21 of our earnings slide deck. The starting point for any analysis in our Client business should begin with PC sales in mature markets, which we expect to grow in mid single-digit range. We expect to get a modest uplift from emerging markets, where the underlying market growth is higher and we have the opportunity to reduce piracy. Offsetting this uplift is the successful launch of Windows Vista in 2007, which creates a difficult retail comp in fiscal '08. Adding these together, our expectation is that Client organic revenue growth in fiscal '08 will be in line with, or slightly better than, the mid single-digit growth rate for PC sales in mature markets and that Client\u2019s GAAP revenue growth will be 3 percentage points higher than the organic growth rate, due to Windows Vista revenue recognition methodology. We will provide our specific Client revenue guidance for fiscal '08 in July, but I hope this provide you with some insight into how we're thinking about our forecast, and assist you with your modeling. Now moving on to operating income. Operating income is expected to be between $22.0 billion and $22.5 billion. Excluding certain legal charges in fiscal '07, operating income growth of 12% to 14% is slightly faster than revenue growth. This guidance implies incremental year-over-year COGS plus OpEx spending of between $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion, when you exclude legal charges in fiscal '07. Of these amounts, somewhat less than $2.7 billion is operating expenses, which is consistent with our commentary at the February analyst meeting in New York. I would like to take time here to provide you with some of the key drivers behind our COGS and OpEx spending in fiscal '08. First, let's cover COGS. Incremental COGS spending will be in excess of $600 million, driven primarily by two factors. One, higher network infrastructure costs and delivering online services such as Windows Live, Office Live, CRM Live and Xbox Live. Two, increased scale of our consultant services business. Higher overall revenues and greater unit sales of Zune and Xbox 360 will have some impact as well. In terms of incremental operating expenses, I would like to describe the underlying drivers using the same four categories we used for fiscal '07. The largest category remains our broad array of investments in high growth areas. As we continue to stress, innovation drives long-term growth, and we intend to continue to invest in the best opportunities. This makes up over one-third of the incremental OpEx in fiscal '08. The second largest category is our investment in services, which makes up about a quarter of the incremental OpEx in the business. The online services area is also critical to our future success, and we have built up an appropriate level of potential future investment that reflects our current thinking. The third category is marketing and field sales costs, which makes up about 25% of the total. The remainder of the incremental operating expenses are driven by general increases in costs, as well as unallocated spending related to small acquisitions that we may do during the year. Now for the rest of the income statement. We expect investment income to be lower in fiscal '08 due to lower cash balances resulting from our stock repurchases in fiscal '07. We're also modeling a 30.5% tax rate in fiscal '08, driven by a higher mix of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Our forecast for fully diluted earnings per share is therefore $1.58 to $1.72, representing growth of 14% to 15%, excluding legal charges and tax benefits in fiscal '07. Similar to fiscal '07, we expect to grow earnings this year at a rate faster than revenue and operating income. As always, I will remind you that as you think about the guidance we have provided that you also consider the risks. Those risks include competitive, legal, execution and general market risks, as well as PC and Turbo hardware growth rates and customer acceptance of our product. Also, our emerging businesses are harder to forecast when compared to our mature businesses and as they become a larger part of the overall financial mix, they may contribute to increased volatility in our performance. I would like to wrap up today with two final and brief observations. The first is that if we take a step back and look at the results we have delivered, as well as the guidance provided for fiscal '08, you find that we're growing revenue, profits and earnings per share at impressive rates on both an absolute and relative basis for a company our size. For example, excluding legal charges and tax benefits, our fiscal '08 guidance implies earnings per share growth of $0.41 to $0.45, or 32% to 35% over two years. The second observation is that I believe the third quarter results and the guidance we have provided are indicative of how we build long-term shareholder value in the company. We do so by driving robust revenue growth for our established cores in the desktop and server markets, as well as by building new cores in online services and entertainment. By translating that revenue growth into strong operating profits and cash flow, allows us the flexibility to make significant investments to drive future growth, and finally by returning capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We believe this is an optimal model for delivering long-term shareholder value and I'm pleased that our third quarter and our forward-looking outlook reflect our execution against this. Thank you for your time today and I will now hand the call over to Colleen so we can take your questions.\nColleen Healy: Let\u2019s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi part questions and limit yourselves to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini - UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Thanks Rick and Colleen. I actually had a question about the premium mix that you reported. It seems to be coming in much better than what you guys had forecasted prior to Vista launching. I just wanted to get your sense for how you think this is going to track over time, and should we hold constant this type of Vista Premium mix adoption? In terms of the 85/15 mix that you're forecasting between Vista and XP, how would that have compared to your expectations of what actually happened when XP launched? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: In terms of the Premium mix, you're right, it is coming in above our expectations and are good. Within that obviously you do have a shift between Pro and what was previously Media standard. There's a mix shift within the mix. We think that we are going to see in fiscal year '08 a continuation of the trend that we saw in fiscal year '07 so the numbers from a Premium point of view will be broadly the same. What we're thinking of doing probably for next year is to start to give you some more visibility into how that Premium mix is made up, because, as we have talked about on previous calls, this is quite a different economic impact, depending on in this case whether it is Vista Premium or Vista Business, one being five times the economic benefit relative to the other. So we'll continue to give you the Premium mix as we see, which you can think of as being broadly equal to fiscal year '07 a lot of the benefit that we are seeing. But will also start to give you some visibility into the split of that Premium mix going forward as well. What was the second half of your question?\nHeather Bellini: You commented about a 85% Windows Vista mix, 15% XP. What did you see during the last cycle when XP launched, what was the mix?\nColleen Healy: It is not going to be terribly comparable just because of also the SKUs structure.\nChris Liddell: But generally speaking it is faster. So 85/15 is very healthy. Now it obviously may vary on that, it is going to depend on the consumer versus the business.\nHeather Bellini: Are you forecasting faster adoption of Vista than what you saw for adoption of XP, is the question?\nChris Liddell: We don't think of it that way. We don't do a comparison back to that. But if you look at the math of it, that is likely to be the result. What we are looking at is the underlying trends we see in the business relative to Vista, regardless of what might have happened four years ago. As we see the mix in consumer versus business, and as we see the overall growth rates and as we see the current adoption, we think 85% is a reasonable starting point for next year.\nColleen Healy: You know, obviously, the variable there that people look to is on the business side and how quickly they're adopting. We feel like because this version, as you'll remember when was in beta was very widely tested, we feel like the tools and costs associated with it and ease of images, we are optimistic but we still don't want to get ahead of ourselves.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie DiBona: Chris, you spent a lot of time clarifying client guidance and accounting, but I'm wondering if I could maybe change gears for a second and look at my favorite group, the Online Services group? It seems like from your financial results this quarter and from some of the external metrics that you maybe stopped some of the deterioration there. Certainly any metrics more that you want to share there would be appreciated. Going forward, now that you have sort of stabilized the patient, can you maybe talk strategically about how you want to get him up off the table and move in the right direction? Maybe also how you're going to build share and community and how OSG relates in that process to the other business groups, both in building its business and then feeding back into those ones?\nChris Liddell: Lots to digest in that one. But let me cover the ground, and then get back on any particular aspect. You're absolutely right. From a quarterly point of view this was a much better quarter for OSB. If you exclude the Access and Subscription business, the advertising revenue, which is probably the single best metric to look at in terms of growth year on year, was up 23%. If you look at the guidance that we're talking about for next quarter, we're looking at greater than 20% again in the fourth quarter as well. That is a reflection of a number of factors. One is display growth revenue growing broadly in line with market. The second is the benefits now of Ad Center are coming on stream. So we have talked with you about this a lot. We said that we would lap our previous monetization rate on Ad Center at some stage in this fiscal year. Well, we did that in that third quarter. So we're a little ahead of ourselves. We were expecting more like fourth quarter, but we did it in the third quarter. So we are ahead of where we were on the Overture platform of a year ago now and obviously on an appreciating trend. When you look at the number of advertisers that we are getting on the platform, we're getting at or above the rates that we were expecting and with considerably less advertisers than on the Overture platform, we're getting a higher monetization. So we are feeling very good about the rates that we are seeing in terms of Ad Center overall. That is feeding through to the revenue growth numbers that you see, if you exclude the Access. Again, we will try quarter by quarter to give you that advertising number to give you a sense of the health of the underlying business. To your broader question about strategy, from our point of view it is a continuation of what we have talked about, which is we are going to invest in this business because we see it as a long-term one. We like a lot of the growth that we are getting on the display side. We are happy with it. On the communication side, you have the growth in Hotmail and Messenger accounts, which we don't currently monetize to any great extent, but it still is extremely healthy and we're very happy with, for example, some of the relevancy in the underlying product in our search. We aren't happy, clearly, with the market share we have. So some things we are happy with, some things that we're not happy with, or I would like to see a lot better but we are going to continue to invest. We're going to continue to invest in the infrastructure of the business, we will continue to invest in new products, we will continue to invest in the search relevancy side of things. And in terms of the infrastructure, that will support not only the online business, but it will support Office Live. It will support Xbox Live. That is another healthy statistic from our point of view, with greater than 6 million customers now on Xbox Live. So that is a very good platform. The platform will support that area. In terms of accounting, to a large extent we bear the costs inside the Online Services area without trying to change accounting around. We may try and give you more visibility into how it helps some of the other businesses, but certainly strategically it helps them quite a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Holt - JP Morgan.\nAdam Holt: My question is about the underlying strength in the Office business or the MBD category. If you strip out the one-time events in the quarter, it looks like you still had about 20% growth in MBD. I guess what I'm trying to understand is what was the mix between what came off the balance sheet relative to what was new business? And understanding there's a little bit of retail spike here, how should we think about the Enterprise business feathering in over the next couple of quarters, particularly in the context of how you compare that to Vista?\nChris Liddell: I think it is great. We tend to get 90% of our questions about Client, and to a large extent the MBD business is a real success story in the third quarter. We exceeded our revenue expectations by around $200 million and that was on the back of, to a large extent, just very good retail sales, so sales of units out the door. We feel like that is a direct customer acceptance of a very good product. It didn't result from any balance sheet movements. In fact, we are slightly penalized because of the change in revenue recognition inside that division but to a large extent, very good customer acceptance, very good retail sales inside the quarter. In terms of annuities going forward, which is probably more of the case; obviously we're not going to at this date give you fiscal year '08 numbers, but for the fourth quarter a continuation of very good revenue growth numbers inside that division. Embedded inside fiscal year '08 we think the business will continue to do well. I am happy, very happy with the retail acceptance of the product. From an annuity point of view and a business point of view at this stage it is early days, but it is good as well.\nColleen Healy: Just in terms of that housekeeping matter, we had about $0.5 billion of Tech Guarantee. Your 20% year on year is the normalized growth, and we think it speaks to the strength of the business and the launch in the quarter.\nChris Liddell: But to be clear, 20% is excluding the Tech Guarantee impact.\nAdam Holt: If I could just ask a follow-up on that, if you were to look at this business adding into the next quarter with respect to the small business segment of it, are you seeing small businesses gravitate towards long-term contracts, or do you think the small business activity is going to be principally more like licensing and more like the consumer?\nChris Liddell: We aren't seeing any marked difference in the pick up to any great extent. The same split that we have seen in terms of 40% annuity, 40% license only is, broadly speaking, what we are expecting going forward.\nColleen Healy: Just to add to that, the metrics, certainly the 20% billings growth does speak to the Dynamics business, which targets more of that segment that you're talking about. And then on the CRM side, we did announce in March reaching that milestone of 10,000 customers and 400,000 users. We're continuing to work the value proposition there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John DiFucci - Bear Stearns.\nJohn DiFucci: Chris, you told us what the impact of the Technology Guaranteed Program was on the Client business, but you also mentioned a couple of other events that are different this quarter versus previous quarters. There was a revenue recognition change and also the channel preparation for the launch. Can you tell us what the growth would have been if you excluded both of those? Along the same lines, just to follow, on the revenue rec change, the numbers you threw out there seemed a little low to me, looking at the rest of this year and next. Are you going to give us what the impact has been on a quarterly basis?\nChris Liddell: We will certainly give you the Vista revenue recognition impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis. That is what we can do right at the start. We are very happy to do it. If you look at the chart that I referred to, I'm not sure you had a chance to as I was speaking, it gives you it in black and white. It is $220 million in fiscal year '07 and $660 million in fiscal year '08. Of that $220 million in fiscal year '07, it was broadly equal in Q3 and Q4. That would have had about 0.5% impact from a growth rate point of view. That is just for the Vista revenue recognition impact. For the company overall and for Client it was around 3%. We are certainly happy to work through the math. I know there's a lot of moving parts, but we will give you total transparency to the extent we can.\nJohn DiFucci: Even though in Q3 there was only two months out of the three that really had the impact, you think it will be evenly split? If you included that impact, plus the channel preparation for the launches, I think either you or Colleen mentioned generally usually you see a spike in the revenue due to that. During a launch quarter what would the Client growth have been?\nChris Liddell: If I work through the math, if you start with PC unit growth in the quarter, it was around 10% to 12%. We saw OEM unit growth of 20%. So the units grew in excess of PC units and that is people stocking obviously or restocking, and some of the system builder channel impacts as well, so unit growth of around 20%. If you exclude the Vista and the Tech Guarantee, the OEM revenue grew broadly in line to 21% relative to 20% growth. The commercial and retail, which was obviously the retail spike, grew 53% and Client revenue overall would have grown 27%. So if you exclude all the accounting impacts, that is probably the easiest way to work through it. But it is still a very healthy quarter, up 27%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs.\nSara Friar: Maybe you could switch to just the Entertainment and Devices division. Could you just give us some clarity, Chris, on whether you are still expecting profitability for that division in FY\u201908? Obviously that has been a big milestone. I think last quarter it seemed as if you were managing that inventory, but I assumed that was somewhat ahead of a price cut, so any further color you could give us there would be great. And then just one more on the Halo 3 launch. What are you expecting in terms of impact from Halo 3, and just overall attach rates as the cycle gets a little bit more mature?\nChris Liddell: The sales during the quarter in terms of sell-in were around 500,000 consoles. The sell-through, that is what the retailers sells, was higher than that, so our inventory levels did come down to more around normal levels we would expect. We did a good inventory movement during the course of the quarter. In terms of profitability for next year, that is certainly the target. We're working through our budgeting process now, but from my point of view anyway, that is the starting point going into next year. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts there in terms of our ability to take COGS of the system, how many units we sell and factors like that. But that is certainly the starting point. In terms of Halo 3, that is clearly going to have a positive impact in two senses. One, it gives us more confidence with the number of consoles that we think we are going to be able to sell next year. In terms of a direct impact, obviously it is a third-party product, so it is reasonably profitable from our point of view. It will be several hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue next year.\nSara Friar: Terrific. No change competitively this quarter in terms of Sony and Wii and so on?\nChris Liddell: I'm sorry, what was that?\nSara Friar: Any changes competitively from the other two big game vendors, Sony and Nintendo?\nChris Liddell: No, nothing of significance. We are obviously very happy from a competitive point of view with the response in the marketplace, but nothing of significance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities.\nKirk Materne: Chris, you mentioned going into your fourth quarter you have a number of large multi-year deals up for renewal. Can you just give us some color perhaps around how many of those deals involves say upselling a large enterprise from the Business version to get them on the Enterprise version, which would also take them into a longer-term agreement with you guys around software assurance? I'm just trying to get a sense on how many of those type of deals are still out there where a customer might be on software assurance for Office but not for Vista, for example. Any color around that would be helpful.\nChris Liddell: I can't give you a proportion, but I think if I talk about it the way the field thinks about it, every license that comes up for renewal is an opportunity to sell additional products. When you think about it, it is a three-year anniversary, generally speaking. So in the last three years if you think about the products we have launched, it is not just the obvious ones of Vista and Office. There's a significant amount of additional products that the field now has the ability to sell as part of an enterprise agreement. So there is a significant number of contracts coming up and clearly, there is some risk to the extent those people now have an entitlement to Vista and Office, but there is an opportunity because of all the other products. I don't want to say there is an X percent where we think we will be successful but we certainly feel good about maintaining the renewal rate of two-thirds to three-quarters, and in some instances they would be additional products as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: I just want to clarify on the EPS guidance for fiscal '08, that does include the positive impact from the rev rec rate, so how would you quantify that if you look at the $1.68 to $1.72, does $0.04 to $0.05 positive impact from the rev rec seem like a reasonable assumption?\nChris Liddell: We give the specific number, so depending on how you treat it. But if we look at the GAAP unearned income that comes off our balance sheet and we expect to flow through the income statement next year, it is $660 million. So that will equate to around $0.04 a share, if you take an after-tax and divide it by our number of shares. So that number may go up or down slightly depending on our actual sales and the mix of Vista and XP. But if you just take our guidance as it sits, it would be around $0.04 a share.\nKash Rangan: What is the confidence level at this early point in the cycle, Chris, with 85% Vista, 15% XP assumption? What we hear from our surveys is that a lot of the Enterprises seem to want to do an implementation of Vista in 2008. So how are you thinking about the confidence level in the 85/15 mix between Vista and XP?\nChris Liddell: It is early days, so the standard deviation is quite high. But I will just say that our fiscal year '08 picks up the first six months of calendar year 2008. So to the extent that some people are on the sidelines waiting, they may well be looking at a position of early next year and that would pick up our fiscal year. It could be a relatively high swing between 85/15. From a revenue recognition point of view that might move around from an accounting perspective. From a cash flow point of view, it is not really going to have a significant impact.\nKash Rangan: Finally, the units on Vista you disclosed, I think one month after the launch, was 20 million. Any update on that during the quarter how many units of Vista? If you could break that out between OEM and retail, that would be useful.\nChris Liddell: No, I don't have a number to give you today. I'm happy to talk to the Client people, and if there's a number they would like to give out, we will follow-up with that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, good afternoon. Chris, next year for fiscal '08 on operating margins, I believe that implies roughly flat with '07. Can you help us reconcile, considering that you're headed in probably the strongest point of your product cycle in a number of years, how you expect that operating margin to play out with regard to what your long-term model looks like and where you were at a couple of years ago at much higher operating margins?\nChris Liddell: Sure. I will start with just the guidance we have given you, at least on a GAAP basis. So we talk about revenue growth of 11% to 12%, and operating income growth of 12% to 14%. So you see a slight margin expansion based on that, although some of that is obviously the Vista accounting impact, and obviously earnings per share growing at 14% to 15%, so higher again; so a little bit improved margins in that respect. When I look at next year, we are still in investment mode in Online Services. We are looking at year-on-year growth on expenses broadly in line with what we have talked about. We're talking about growing the company's revenue base 11% to 12%. So if we can get margin expansion, I think that is tremendous. I think you have to look at the underlying businesses and look at them one by one. But if we can grow the company top line 11% to 12% and maintain or possibly slightly enhance our margin structure, I think that is a good starting base for a company of our size.\nBrent Thill: I would just be curious to get your thoughts. A number of the hardware companies have mentioned a sluggish March. It appears that you're not seeing that. Maybe offer some thoughts in terms of what the difference is there. As a follow-up on the business segment, you mentioned the consumer segment is tracking ahead of the business. When do you expect the business segment to really start to kick in?\nChris Liddell: Obviously we have a lot of different cycles from a hardware manufacturer, given the number of businesses that we're in. You have to look at it across the whole suite of our businesses. The thing that I would say is we are not seeing any significant slowdown in aggregate across our businesses. Individual businesses may have some, but certainly for the company overall, given the multiplicity of businesses we're involved in, we are seeing healthy demand. We have a good international business as well, which helps as well. I assume your question was mainly around North America, but a large number of our sales are outside North America and the economies are doing very well there and we're certainly seeing growth rates that are very good there as well. So no particular aspects there. What was the second part of your question?\nBrent Thill: Just in terms of when do you think the business segment starts to maybe eclipse the consumer segment, when you see that strength kicking in?\nChris Liddell: I think the business segment is probably going to continue to be broadly equal to what it is at the moment. So it is really around consumer growth and whether that changes or not. But if the business growth continues in the sort of mid single-digits, the consumer growth is probably growing in excess of 10%. I don't necessarily see that inverting for the foreseeable future. I think customer growth would have to slide down quite a lot in order to dip below business growth, which I think is going to remain relatively healthy.\nColleen Healy: Thanks so much.

We are pleased to be with you today to share our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2007. Looking back over the second quarter, I would characterize it as a very good close to the first half of the year, and it continues our progress for an excellent year overall. All aspects of our financial performance came in at or above the high end of our guidance. We were happy to see the PC hardware market strength in the quarter. And, by launching our flagship products to business customers at the end of November, we passed the last significant milestone towards forward availability. Looking at our second quarter financial performance, revenue grew 6%. If you were to exclude the $1.6 billion revenue deferral associated predominately with our technology guarantee program for Windows and Office, our revenue growth would have been 20%. That is impressive growth for any company, let alone one of our size. Business customer demand for our server and tools and Microsoft business division products was healthy across major geographies in both our large and small customer segments. Looking specifically at sales in December, we saw encouraging signs of early demand for the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Exchange Server 2007 and Windows Vista. Retail demand during the holiday quarter was robust for consumer PCs as well as for Xbox 360 consoles and games, helping to push revenue for both client and entertainment and devices to the upper end of our quarterly guidance. Operating income benefited from both the strong revenue as well as lower spending, primarily on marketing programs, most of which shifted out of quarter 2 and into the rest of the year. The operating income results flowed through the P&L and drove EPS numbers that came in $0.02 to $0.04 above what we told you in October. Moving to the full fiscal year, 2007 continues to deliver excellent financial performance. Next week, we celebrate the consumer launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Office system. Our product groups will have put in significant work to deliver what are truly compelling products, and now our customers can benefit from those efforts. Let me make two key points about fiscal 2007. First, I'm very pleased that we continue to expect full year double-digit revenue growth. Overall, this is in line with what we told you last quarter, although we are making some adjustments to the mix of revenue. Second, excluding legal charges and tax benefits in the prior year, we expect earnings per share will also grow double-digits and faster than revenue. This growth is even after we launch the major products and continue to invest in future growth opportunities in all our divisions. With those high level themes for the quarter and for the full year of 2007, I'm going to the turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on our second quarter performance.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, Q2 was a strong quarter overall, contributing to a good first half of the fiscal year. During the quarter revenue, operating income and EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance and we continued executing on our product cycle, with the business launch of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Exchange Server 2007. Let me provide you with details on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. Revenue for the quarter was $12.5 billion, up 6%. Growth for the quarter was impacted by $1.6 billion in revenue deferrals out of Q2 that will be recognized in Q3, primarily related to the Windows and Office Technology Guarantee Program. The deferral amount is up slightly from the $1.5 billion that we previously guided, driven by strength in the PC market. Adjusting for these revenue deferrals, revenue growth would have been 20%. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 76% increase in entertainment and devices and robust growth in our core businesses of client, server and tools, and the Microsoft business division, which grew a combined 11% after adjusting for the deferrals, primarily from the tech guarantees. Healthy growth in the hardware market was a key contributor to the results for the quarter. We estimate the PC market grew faster than we expected at 8% to 10% during the quarter. This growth is particularly strong, considering the upcoming consumer launch of Windows Vista, illustrating the success of our Tech Guarantee Program, as well as the continuing value proposition of Windows XP. Consumer PC shipment growth once again outpaced business shipments, driven by a strong holiday sales season. From a form factor perspective, growth in notebook PC shipments continues to outpace that of desktops. PC unit growth continues to be led by the emerging markets. Asia, excluding Japan, and Latin America maintained double-digit growth rates, while the remaining regions grew at single digits. Server hardware shipment growth remained consistent with our full year estimate of 10% to 12%. Our mix of products billings was approximately 30% from OEM, 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license-only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Relative to prior year, our billing mix continues to shift to our other businesses, driven by the increasing revenue from our entertainment and devices divisions. We had a very strong quarter overall from a volume licensing perspective, with broad-based strength across our customer segments and regions, which drove growth in enterprise agreements, as well as select and open annuity licenses. We estimate that EA renewal rates were at the high end of our historical range of 56% to 75%. In addition, select and open license-only growth accelerated in December after the business launches of Windows Vista, the 2007 Office system and Exchange Server 2007. Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter a bit higher than we expected at $11.9 billion, including the $1.7 billion of deferrals primarily related to the technology guarantees. Excluding this impact, the unearned balance would have grown 15% over the prior year and still have been up sequentially. Our contracted, non-billed balance at the end of December was also sequentially higher and now exceeds $9.5 billion. If you consider our reported revenue and changes in the unearned and contracted, non-billed balances, our bookings growth exceeded 20% for the quarter. Before I get into the revenue details for each business group, let me point out that changes in foreign exchange rates added about 1 point to our overall revenue growth rate. Client revenue of $2.6 billion, a decline of 25%, includes the impact of $1.1 billion of revenue deferrals, primarily related to the tech guarantee. Adjusting for this impact, Client revenue would have been $3.7 billion, up 9%, driven by growth in the OEM business. OEM revenue increased 8%, excluding the tech guarantee, due to 10% growth in OEM license units. OEM revenue grew at a slightly slower pace than license units, due to the continued increased volume in emerging markets and the shift in channel mix towards larger OEMs, partially offset by the impact from the increase in premium mix. OEM premium mix increased 18 percentage points from the prior year to 67%. Consistent with the relative strength in the consumer segment, especially during holiday, and deferred by the technology guarantee program, we saw a shift within the premium mix itself. Specifically, the growth in the premium mix was a result of consumers purchasing Windows XP Media Center, driven by the upgrade pricing structure offered under the technology guarantee program. So while Windows XP Professional grew year on year, its portion of the premium mix declined a couple of percentage points. While we are delighted to see the increasing trend of consumers recognizing the value offered in premium Windows, we want to point out to you that in the U.S., Windows XP Professional generates over five times the pricing uplift over Windows XP Home than does Windows XP Media Center. Client commercial and retail licensing grew 13%, primarily from sales of Windows Vista into the retail channel, and our partners began readying for Windows Vista general availability. Our commercial business remained healthy, fueled by growth in multi-year contract agreements. The client business made significant progress on the product front this quarter with the business launch of Windows Vista, the most significant operating system release since Windows 95. Server and tools delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Its 17% revenue growth was driven by broad adoption of our server and tools product line, particularly SQL Server, which had another quarter of over 30% revenue growth. Revenue for our online services business grew 5% to $624 million, driven by an increase in advertising revenue of 20%, partially offset by an expected decline in access revenue. Healthy growth in display, coupled with a modest increase in search, drove the rise in the total advertising revenue. Increasing search queries contributed to search revenue growth on a year-over-year basis for the first time since we began our transition to AdCenter in the U.S. last year. Microsoft business division revenue was $3.5 billion, or $4 billion after adjusting for the $500 million tech guarantee and preshipment deferral. Growth was driven by the strength of our annuity business and earlier than expected uptake in our license-only business following the business launches of the 2007 Office system and Exchange Server 2007. The Dynamics business continued its strong performance in Q2, as demonstrated by a 19% increase in customer billings. Lastly, entertainment and devices growth of 76% for the quarter was driven by Xbox 360 sales. We have now sold 10.4 million consoles life to date. And according to NTB, consumers in the U.S. purchased more Xbox 360s than both the Wii and PlayStation 3 combined during the month of December. Software attach rates remain at record levels in the U.S., bolstered by the broad success of Gears of War, which sold over 2.7 million copies in its first eight weeks in market. Our mobile and embedded device business also performed well, selling over 3 million licenses for Windows mobile phone-enabled devices, up over 90% year over year. During the quarter, we launched the Zune digital media player in the United States, which furthers our strategy of connected entertainment. Now for the rest of the income statement: positive revenue increase 62%, due primarily to an increase in Xbox 360 sales. As a result, gross margin relative to the prior year was down about 10 percentage points, a slightly larger drop than the guidance we provided in October. This was primarily driven by stronger than expected sales of Xbox 360, as well as an extension of the Xbox 360 warranty from 90 days to one year in the U.S. and Canada. Q2 operating expenses other than cost of revenue increased $509 million or 10%. This was a little higher than expected, due to the timing of certain spending, particularly for sales and marketing programs. Operating income was $3.5 billion. Adjusting for the tech guarantee deferrals, operating income would have been $5.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year, driven by strength in our core businesses. Investment income and other totaled $333 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, up from 29% last year. This year over year rate increase was impacted by a $108 million tax benefit in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased 205 million shares or $6 billion worth of our stock and paid $980 million in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding were 9.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year, as a result of execution on our share repurchase program. Our diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were impacted by the issuance of 113 million shares in December related to options exercised by JP Morgan for the employee stock option transfer program completed in December 2003. This settlement marks the final expiration of all remaining options under its program. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, which includes approximately an $0.11 per share deferral, primarily from tech guarantees. So in summary, Q2 delivered strong results across the board. Revenue results for all of the segments met or exceeded the top end of our guidance and translated to out performance for both operating income and EPS. Additionally, the quarter marked the business launch of our flagship products. With that, let me turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with our expectations for Q3 and the remainder of fiscal 2007.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. Before we get into the specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. Our fiscal 2007 forecast assumes no major changes in the economic conditions from where we exited the first half, and we're not forecasting any significant impacts from foreign exchange rate movements. We expect PC unit growth to be 8% to 10% for the fiscal year, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter, and between 9% to 11% for the third quarter. We continue to estimate the PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment, and higher in the emerging markets than in mature markets. On the server hardware front, we remain comfortable with our estimate for total market price of 10% to 12% for the year. Now let me get into our detailed guidance. For the full year, we expect our revenues to come in at $50.2 billion to $50.7 billion, growing 13% to 14%. We are narrowing our revenue range to reflect how we finished the second quarter, as well as to incorporate changes to the mix of revenue. Our growth is driven by broad-based revenue growth across our five segments, with each of our core businesses growing double-digits. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $13.7 billion to $14.0 billion, which represents growth of 26% to 28% year over year. Our third quarter will benefit from recognition of the $1.7 billion of revenue that we deferred out of the first half, $45 million from Q1 and $1.64 billion from Q2, primarily associated with our technology guarantee program. Before these impacts, third quarter revenue guidance would have been $12 billion to $12.3 billion, which would have represented growth of 10% to 13%. There's clearly no impact to the full year, as we have discussed. With that, revenue guidance in our five business units is as follows: For client, we have increased our full year growth forecast to 11% to 12%, up from the 9% to 10% we gave you in October and this has been driven by a higher premium mix in our OEMs revenue and a faster transition to Windows Vista. We expect third quarter growth to be 54% to 56%, although our third quarter guidance includes the recognition of approximately $1.2 billion in revenue primarily associated with our tech guarantee program. Before that deferral, third quarter revenue would be growing 16% to 18%. Growth accelerates in the second half of the year for the commercial and retail portion of the client segment, beginning in quarter 3, driven by broad availability of Windows Vista. Client OEM revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC hardware market for the year. We are increasing our expectation for premium mix in the second half of the year and we now expect our full-year premium mix to be about 60%. The increase is driven by mix assumptions for our consumer premium products such as Windows XP Media Center and Windows Vista Home Premium. As Colleen mentioned earlier, we have received modest revenue upside from our consumer premium SKUs versus what we get on Windows XP Pro or Windows Vista Business. Server and tools revenue should grow 16% to 17% for the year from continued growth of SQL Server, development tools and our enterprise services. Revenue for the third quarter should also be up 16% to 17%. We forecast revenue in the online services business to grow between 3% and 8% for the year and 4% to 10% in quarter 3. Although we're still forecasting growth in search queries and page views, our plans now include a more measured rate of growth for the balance of the year. Our full year forecast anticipates total advertising growth in the mid-teens, and we expect this to be driven in particular by our display business, which is growing at a healthy rate, as we see good page growth in our key properties. We continue to have high aspirations to grow this business and we will continue to invest in the business during the second half. Microsoft business division revenue should increased 10% to 11% for the year, an increase of 2 percentage points from the guidance we gave you last quarter on increased business uptake of the 2007 Office system. Q3 revenue should grow 27% to 28%. Our third quarter revenue guidance includes the recognition of approximately $0.5 billion of revenue deferred from the second quarter related to our tech guarantee program and 2007 Office system preshipments into the channel. If you were to adjust for that impact, revenue growth for quarter 3 would have been 13% into 14%. We are encouraged by the favorable customer response we saw in December surrounding our new products. In the entertainment and devices division, we are pleased with what we have been able to accomplish in the past year, including achieving our goal of having sold over 10 million consoles life to date, outselling competitive next-generation consoles during this holiday season, achieving record software attach rates and reaching 5 million Xbox Live members. With that strong momentum, we are making tradeoffs and choices in managing the Xbox business to achieve our targeted profitability in fiscal year '08. In the near term, this means we will optimize for profitability. We believe this puts us in a strong market and financial position as we go into fiscal 2008, a year that will feature a number of catalysts, highlighted by the strongest first and third-party game lineup we've ever had. As we look at historical seasonality, pricing and inventory levels, we're taking a more cautious view of the market, and our half 2 revenue and console guidance reflects that. We are now forecasting full year revenue growth of 26% to 31% and a decline of 15% to 25% for the third quarter and expect to exit June having sold about 12 million Xbox 360 units since launch, down from our previous guidance of 13 million to 15 million. That reduction in console units also results in a reduction in revenue related to attached software, accessories and Live. Moving on to operating income, for the year we expect to generate between $19.3 billion and $19.7 billion of operating income, representing growth of 10% to 12%, excluding legal charges taken in fiscal 2006. This is an increase of approximately $200 million on both the low end and high end, this is what we told you in October, now representing double-digit growth even at the low end. We are flowing through some of the revenue upside and keeping full year spending in line with what we had in October. For the third quarter, we expect operating income to be between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, including the impact from revenue recognized from our tech guarantee and preshipments. Excluding this impact, operating income for the third quarter would be between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion. Third quarter operating income includes some costs deferred from the second quarter, as well as operating costs in preparation for the launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Office system. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the full year should increase by 1 percentage point over last year, in line with what we said in October. We continue to estimate a full year tax rate of 31%, consistent with what we saw in the second quarter and with our October guidance. Diluted earnings per share, we're bringing up the range for the year by $0.02 at the low end and $0.01 at the high end due to higher revenue in our core businesses of client, server and tools, and MBD. This translates into a full-year expected range of $1.45 to $1.47 and $0.45 to $0.46 for the third quarter. The third quarter earnings per share includes approximately $0.12 per share associated with the impact of the tech guarantee program. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2007 up 6% to 8% due to our better performance in Q2. Contracted not billed should also finished 2007 up from where we exited fiscal 2006. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from quarter 2 to quarter 3, we expect a decline of slightly greater than $1.7 billion of revenue we'll recognize associate with our tech guarantee program and presales. This decline would be consistent with normal seasonality. For our full year unearned revenue guidance, we're modeling a moderation in the recent annuity mix of our billings as both the 2007 Office system and Windows Vista will be available to customers in the second half of the year. I'll remind you though, as you think about guidance for the rest of the year, we still face the risks and opportunities I have highlighted in our previous two earnings calls: for example, competitive, legal, execution and general market risks; as well as PC and server hardware growth rates, customer acceptance of our products, and the costs to remain competitive, such as those to acquire and serve customers in our online businesses. Also, our emerging businesses are harder to forecast when compared to our mature businesses, so as they continue to become a larger part of our overall financial mix, they may contribute to increased volatility in our quarterly performance. Before moving to questions and answers, I would like to make a couple of quick comments. I committed to you at our financial analyst meeting last year to provide you with a more continuous flow of information throughout the year, and that would include communication from Steve and me. We will do that on February 15 in New York City, and for those of you unable to join us for that, we will make available a live webcast as well as an on-demand replay of the presentation. The intention of this presentation is for Steve and me to meet with investors and provide an update on our strategic direction after completing our internal strategy meetings. Although we may generally discuss revenue and spending trend levels, we will not give any detailed financial information. As in past years, we will provide our first preliminary review of fiscal 2008 guidance on our third quarter earnings call in April. Since the financial analyst meeting in July, we have also had executives out talking with the financial community in a variety of forums at a pace over once a month outside of our quiet periods. Looking forward into half 2, we will double that frequency. In general, we have been trying to give you more overall exposure to all of our senior executives and we look forward to seeing you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started with some of your questions. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and please limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini - UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Good afternoon, Chris and Colleen. I was wondering if you could give us your assumptions for higher price SKU mix in the March quarter, because if we adjust for the technology reversal that you are going to have in March, then it appears that you're looking for client segment growth of roughly 20% versus a PC shipment forecast that is about half that. The second question I would have is that for Service Pack 1, it typically comes out one year after the release of Windows, if we look back historically. I'm just wondering if we should be thinking less than that now, given your desire to shorten Windows development cycles.\nChris Liddell: In terms of the quarter 3, if I work through the math of taking you from the shipment units that we see down to the revenue, that will probably help you the most. And then I will talk about service packs. As I mentioned in the formal remarks, we expect shipments in the third quarter to be 9% to 11%. We are assuming that our units that we sell will be at the top end of that range, 11%, so we'll still have a modest improvement. The main factor that is going to drive the revenue is going to be on the commercial and retail. So we will, again as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we will certainly get a significant impact from that element of the revenue that is commercial and retail. As you'll recall, that's only about 20% of the total revenue but we're expecting it to grow significantly relative to the previous year, obviously, with Vista being available for the first time. So those will be, in essence, the main drivers. You are right, that will get us up to revenue growth that is close to 20% for the quarter.\nHeather Bellini: On the service pack side?\nColleen Healy: On the service pack side, Heather, we have seen a lot of the same rumors that you probably have in the press in terms of dates. The company hasn't put a date out there. It always makes sense to see how the product does out of the gate, continue to get feedback and we don't have an SP date to share with you today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie DiBona: Hi, Chris. I was wondering if we could turn to the online services business. It looks like the display ads are doing fine, but search is slipping share pretty consistently in all the independent numbers. You have now lowered guidance, it looks like while you might be growing search a little bit you are certainly going to continue to slip share if you stick to this guidance. How should we be looking at this business? How can we evaluate progress here? When can we expect a turnaround?\nChris Liddell: You are right, Charlie, to break the business down into its different bits. Clearly, the overall results are impacted by adCenter decline. but if I take that out and look at the advertising revenue overall, it grew 20% for the quarter, which we're happy with. If you break that down into display and search, clearly there is a better story on the display side, and we are growing broadly in line market. So I'd like to think we can put a tick in that box and we are comfortable with the progress we are making there. On the search side, you are correct that we lost market share certainly relative to the independent assessment during the quarter, and are clearly not happy with that. We continue to take a long term view of this business. We continue to invest in it, and we are making progress in the short term on some of the factors that we think are important: getting advertisers onto our adCenter platform, turning the corner in terms of revenue on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Since we went off Overture, the second quarter is the first quarter where we are seeing consecutive growth in revenue and we still expect to get revenue per search equal to where we were a year ago by the end of this year. So we are making progress in some of the underlying factors and we are continuing to invest. But I expect you should and we should expect to see more progress in the long term on the search side.\nCharlie DiBona: Does there come a time when you can share some of those metrics you say are doing better internally? Because we don't see them out here.\nColleen Healy: From a communications standpoint, Charlie, what we've really set up is at our financial analyst meeting there are some specific metrics that we told you you will hear, really from Kevin Johnson: breadth of usage, depth of usage and how we're doing on monetization, really similar to our competitors in terms of providing some of those underlying drivers quarter by quarter. It is not something that we are doing, it doesn't necessarily make sense from a competitive standpoint. There tends to also be pretty decent third-party information out there. But you will continue to hear from the business leaders, as well as Chris, directly at FAM on those metrics that we outlined at the financial analyst meeting last year, and we'll update you again on at least a yearly basis.\nChris Liddell: Charlie, the other thing I would say is once we lap coming off Overture you'll be able to do a much better comparison because then we are comparing ourselves to ourselves. So in two or three quarters I think the comparables year on year will be much easier for you to make an assessment of progress. Also, as the impact of the access business decline becomes much less significant, then you are really looking at the underlying business growth. So it won't necessarily get to the level of granularity that I know you have consistently been looking for. But I think it will become, hopefully, more useful to you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Just to clarify the Xbox commentary, Chris, is that more of an inventory flush-out that causes you to lower the guidance for the rest of the year? Also, if you could comment on the premium mix. If you experience better mix shift to the higher-end versions of Vista after the launch, will that cause the company to raise its guidance for the client business or is that already factored into the guidance? That\u2019s it, thanks.\nChris Liddell: On the Xbox side, certainly the healthy inventory that we have seen which is partially a result of the very good sales that we saw into the channel in the second quarter last year, is one of the factors behind what we're looking for in the second half. Also, as we start to think about fiscal year '08 and what's the best approach to take for fiscal year '08 in terms of profitability, so we're just making some strategic decisions around what we might do there, too. So it is those two things, broadly speaking, which are the reasons why we are giving the guidance we are. On the premium side, we have embedded inside the guidance that we have given you the premium mix that we now have of 60%. So that is reflected in the guidance for fiscal year '07. Clearly, as Colleen mentioned, inside that 60% there is a mix within a mix, so depending on how that came out between the consumer SKUs and the business SKUs, if that changed, the 60% could still be the case, but we could have a different revenue number there. But at this stage, based on our expectation of the premium mix and how the business and consumer elements of that were made up, that is reflected in the guidance.\nKash Rangan: So you are not assuming any change in the business versus the consumer within the premium as it relates to '07 guidance just as yet? You're basically using the same experience as with XP to make your forecast, right?\nChris Liddell: It is not the same experience as XP. It is the same experience, if you like, as what we forecast at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs.\nRick Sherlund: Thanks. Chris, the launch of Vista, Office 2007 and Exchange Server coming up at the end of this month, if I want to be a little more optimistic about the revenues in Q3, you've given a little bit of precise guidance there and I'm just not sure how predictable the demand is going to be. I'd just ask you to talk to that issue in terms of your ability to forecast for Q3, given the launch of some pretty major new products and whether you might think it reasonable to think that we could see more upside in Q3.\nChris Liddell: Richard, we've talked about it before, I think this is different from if you go back a decade, obviously, to a Windows 95 impact. We certainly think it would be positive, but more gradual as it rolls out into the marketplace. In terms of the impact on overall sales, we were heartened by the quarter 2 results. We are certainly heartened by the fact that the tech guarantee appeared to avoid any stalling of sales in that quarter. But we are sticking with the external numbers that you have seen and that is flowing through in turn to our second half. Could there be some upside to that? Yes, clearly there is, but obviously there could be some downside as well. I talk about that on the risks and opportunities side. If the product was extremely well received and if there was very strong demand at say the top end of our expectations for the second half, clearly that would flow through. At this stage, it is launching next week, and we're taking what we consider to be just an appropriately conservative view of the second half.\nRick Sherlund: SQL Server up 30%-plus again this quarter against a launch last year of the new product, I'm a little surprised that we are continuing to see 30%-plus growth from that product, particularly on a tougher comparison. Any light you can shed on what is happening or why we're seeing such robust growth there?\nChris Liddell: Yes, we were positively surprised on the upside there, too. The only thing I would say is that the price increase went in during the quarter. So you've got some part of the quarter which is price impacted, if you like. So it will definitely become a much harder comparable in the second half. But in terms of underlying sales, it was a good quarter, you are right.\nRick Sherlund: Chris, on the Xbox, just finally, I hear what you're saying that you want to manage inventory levels down it sounds like, over the next couple of quarters. Certainly if there were a price reduction coming, you would want to minimize your channel inventory levels before you would do something like that. Am I understanding correctly that what you're trying to do is manage inventory levels down for Xbox in the second fiscal half?\nChris Liddell: I wouldn't put it in those terms. We are looking at the numbers that we sell into the channel based on where we see the inventory at the start of the year and the patterns of sales that we think will come up. So the net result of that may well be that we see inventory come down. But if you like, it is an outcome, not a management of that.\nRick Sherlund: You're not seeing any change in the competitive environment; there's no change in your assumptions of market share?\nChris Liddell: No.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Holt \u2013 JP Morgan.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. You made a number of comments about the ASP and premium mix expectations around Windows. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what you are expecting within Office. Obviously, you have got a number of new SKUs with Small Business Pro/Ultimate. What does the guidance imply in terms of ASP improvement and what do you think is reasonable for us to expect?\nChris Liddell: Well, to the extent that obviously we're just giving guidance for the balance of this year it is not a huge impact. There is clearly revenue coming through from the first half which is not significantly impacted by that and so there is not a huge impact in the whole of fiscal year '07. Having said that, we did see renewal rates, as Colleen mentioned, at the top end of our 66% to 75% historic range. One of the reasons for that we feel was people anticipating the Office and therefore being attracted to renew. So that, to some extent, flows through in the second half. But in terms of an overall mix shift, it's not a significant component of the fiscal year '07 revenue.\nAdam Holt: If I could just ask a follow up on the strength in unearned, what I was particularly taken with was the client side. If you net out undelivered, it looks like you had better than 30% growth in client unearned. Could you talk about what you are seeing in terms of enterprise renewal activity, reattachment to enterprise licensing, and maybe refresh us on your thinking in terms of what you're expecting for enterprise adoption as we get further into the cycle?\nColleen Healy: On the annuity side, as with Office, a bit with client as you're talking, we have seen really nice renewal rates. They have been really trending at the high end. In particular, to your point, when you look at the various parts going into unearned, we are seeing a bit of an uptick in terms of customers adding Windows under their enterprise agreements. We think the value proposition from the enterprise view is compelling. And of course, you can only get if you are an annuity customer, so that looks promising. But really, I would say at this point, a bit too early to get ahead of ourselves. But we have been noticing that a bit as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Chris, just a follow-up to Adam's question on Office. The reviews have been very solid, and just wondering if you could help us understand what the rationale is, why pricing can't go up in the face of that, considering this is a pretty big release. If you look at the server business, you have raised pricing and it doesn't feel like there has been any pushback.\nColleen Healy: What we could say on the pricing side, actually, is certainly in terms of the upper end views, we have put more value into those offerings. For example, on the Professional Plus offering, which adds the Communicator IM Client and other things, pricing went up a bit, call it 5% or so. On the enterprise SKU, which has Pro and Windows and grew, we did take the opportunity to add more value there. We expect to see some pricing uplift there. So really what you're seeing, whether it is SQL or Office or some of the other products you mentioned, it is really more SKU differentiation that you heard from us really at the financial analyst meeting a year ago, and we are really continuing to look for opportunities to provide value in higher-end SKUs and price accordingly. But again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of adoption rates. Keep in mind that a lot of these products, in particular on Office, because there's already quite a bit going into annuity, you actually recognize that over a period of time on the P&L.\nChris Liddell: From our perspective, at a particular price point, the concept of increasingly trying to add value at that price point over time through software development is just a good philosophy. So we certainly don't think just because we are adding functionality that we should necessarily increase price. In terms of our renewals now in the post-Vista and Office era, the ability to actually offer new products and hence look at enterprise agreements that are much broader, much more of infrastructure-based agreements rather than desktop agreements, is more of the potential.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse.\nJason Maynard: Hi, guys. I have a question on spending. You had indicated that Q2 was a little lower than expected in marketing program spend. Server and tools, I think, did $1 billion in op income. How do you think about Q2 in terms of its impact on spending in the back half of the year and even longer term as you look to invest in places like online services and then even potentially in entertainment devices?\nChris Liddell: We have kept, again, our expenses very much in the context of the year and we have kept our expense number for the year the same as where it has been essentially all year. I am increasingly happy with the discipline we are showing there for the year. In terms of the quarter-by-quarter movement, we certainly give the people flexibility on a quarterly basis to spend on programs as is necessary. We can see swings, in particular in some of the marketing spends with some of the launches on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I wouldn't get too concerned one way or the other. In this case, it's a positive trend on the expenses year to date. I tend to focus on what our expectations are for the year and at this stage, they haven't changed.\nJason Maynard: Maybe just help me reconcile, operating cash flow came in just a touch above $2 billion, which was a little lower than I think most of us were modeling. Can you maybe help us understand the puts and takes on the cash flow number?\nChris Liddell: To some extent, there was obviously inventory builds. We had a relatively high number of Xbox sales and so that does tend to impact our cash flow for the quarter. There could well be, depending on the line you're looking at, the big billings area. So a big unearned can influence the cash flow aspect of it as well. But there were no significant issues. Buyback was relatively high, but we also had the JP Morgan options exercised, so nothing unusual there. I would describe it as a reasonably predictable cash flow quarter, albeit with some big movements inside it.\nColleen Healy: Thanks so much. We have time for a just a few more questions. Our next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Hi, good afternoon. Real quickly, Chris, maybe as a follow-up to the last question, when you look at the leverage you showed this quarter and a little bit of lack of spending in the back half of the year, where do you see additional leverage coming from? What levers do you think that are there that you could execute to deliver upside?\nChris Liddell: Well it's more likely to be on the revenue side. Clearly, we have the opportunity to cut expenses and some of the decisions that we can make, we could, for example, decide to cut back on marketing for the second half of the year. I don't think we will, but we could do it. The upside potential really comes more on the revenue side and that really comes across the board. So clearly, in our client and office division, as Rick's question alluded to earlier, with a launch there's a big amount of variability around that. So there could be some upside there. But we've guided to what we think is probably the appropriate level. In the online services area, there's probably not such a big swing factor there in the overall context of the company, but clearly our ability to continue to generate display advertising and change market share in search has some impact. And then on the entertainment and devices, really it's to a large extent on the revenue side, it is an Xbox story. Again, we have taken what we think is the most likely scenario there. Given the relative seasonality, the June half is a lot less significant than the December half in the Xbox business, so I don't see a high degree of variability. But again, that would be something that would be a big factor. Each of the businesses has their own dynamic. But if you're looking for the things that could swing, it is really in our core businesses with those big launches.\nRobert Breza: Great, thank you, nice quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners.\nTim Klasell: Going to Vista, you've mentioned in the past that you won't be having to hold back the 5% to 25% going into deferred. That should be about $150 million to $250 million a quarter as that rolls off the next three years. Is that the right way to think about that, and is that still the way you plan on doing it?\nChris Liddell: We had quite an extensive discussion last quarter about that. I think we stated that we will give you guidance for fiscal year '08 in our next quarter in terms of exactly how much we expect from that. We want to be transparent about how much is the underlying business, how much is simply just the different revenue recognition. It will be order of magnitude in the sort of numbers you're talking about, but it is too early at this stage to give actual numbers out.\nTim Klasell: Good. One final question, Longhorn, if we look out a little further, how is that tracking and are you still planning on an end of the year release?\nChris Liddell: Yes, we are.\nColleen Healy: Longhorn is tracking. We are expecting really to RTM for the second half of calendar year 2007 and I think you'll hear more from us over time on that. Great, thanks so much. We have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Your final question comes from John McPeake - Prudential.\nJohn McPeake: A question about online offering and dynamics [inaudible] Could you talk a little bit about how Codename Titan, the online product, is going to roll out and the timing there?\nChris Liddell: You are little faint there, sorry. But I picked up your question in terms of Titan, have we gone public on the timing for that?\nColleen Healy: We have.\nChris Liddell: That's the summer this year. So we are on track for that, as we talked about. So that will be in the summer, in six months, if you like.\nJohn McPeake: Does Xbox inventory drawdown have anything to do with potentially a new version of Xbox coming out first fiscal half?\nChris Liddell: No. That was an easy one.\nColleen Healy: Great. Thanks a lot, John. Thank you, everybody for your participation in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call me or my team directly.

We're pleased to be with you today to share our first quarter results and talk with you about how we see the rest of fiscal 2007 shaping up. Looking back over the first quarter, I would characterize it as a very good start to what we are expecting to be an excellent year. All aspects of our financial performance came in at or above the high end of our guidance. Our product groups made considerable progress executing on major product milestones towards their launches in quarter two and beyond, and we continued our progress on returning cash to shareholders, including through our tender offer. Looking back to our first quarter financial performance, revenue came in at the high-end of our guidance, growing 11%, which represents over $1 billion in absolute revenue growth. Server and Tools and our Entertainment and Devices division were particularly strong in the quarter, benefiting from continued customer demand for SQL Server and the Xbox 360. Operating income benefited from both the strong revenue growth, as well as lower spending, primarily on marketing programs, which we shifted out of quarter one and into the rest of the year. Combining that with increased investment income, as we increased liquidity in preparation for the tender offer, our earnings per share results were excellent. This was an important quarter for our business groups, as we made significant progress towards a number of milestones leading up to our product launches in coming months. During the quarter we rolled out Release Candidate 1 of Windows Vista, a Beta 2 technical refresh of the 2007 Office system, a Beta of Exchange Server 2007, and announced the upcoming launch of Zune. To date, these trial versions have been made available to about 5 million Windows Vista users and over 3 million 2007 Office System users. We've been receiving encouraging feedback from partners and customers who are using the betas, which are the most widely-tested releases in the history of these products. We also continue to be active on the acquisition front, averaging more than one a month. This quarter the bulk of our acquisitions were companies that augment the offerings of our Server and Tools business. Our acquisitions focused on the areas of systems recovery and data protection, virtualization, and security. Finally, on the capital structure front, we continue to make steady progress. We finished our prior $30 billion repurchase plan, as we shared with you on the last earnings call, announced a new authorization that runs through July 2011, completed our tender offer, made additional share repurchases outside of the tender offer in the quarter, and increased our quarterly dividend. Moving now to the full fiscal year, 2007 is shaping up well. We will be delivering the second major installment on our multi-year product cycle, helping to fuel revenue growth for the Company. So, let me make a couple of key points about fiscal 2007. First, we continue to expect full-year double-digit revenue growth. In terms of quarterly trends, revenue growth will be impacted by the deferral of approximately $1.5 billion of Client and MBD revenue out of the second quarter and into our third quarter, as a result of the recently-announced technology guarantee programs. As we discussed on the call hosted by Frank and Scott earlier in the week, this movement has no impact on our full-year numbers. Second, growth in operating income in the first half of the year will be impacted by the increasing mix of Xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments to support the launches of our flagship products, and the accounting impact of the technology guarantee programs. This trend should reverse in the second half of the year, when we expect operating income will grow considerably faster than revenue. Finally, excluding legal charges in the prior year, we will grow earnings per share 13% to 15% while launching major products and continuing to invest in the future growth opportunities in all our business divisions. I'm particularly happy that we've been able to broadly maintain our full year earnings per share guidance. Better business performance and higher investment income have helped offset the impact of lower share repurchases in our tender offer and the higher effective tax rate. With those high level things for the quarter and the full year 2007, I'm going to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on our first quarter performance.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. In the interest of providing more time for your questions, I'm going to keep my remarks regarding the fiscal first quarter brief. Overall, we are off to a good start in what is a significant year for the Company. Specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue, operating income and EPS growth at or above the high end of our guidance. We made significant progress on development and launch readiness for key products in the pipeline, including Windows Vista, Office 2007, Exchange Server 2007, and Zune. We returned $7.9 million in capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. I will now provide more detail on our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points, and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. Revenue growth for the quarter was 11%, driven primarily by the business groups significant product launches over the past 12 months, as our new product cycles have been well received by customers. Specifically, Entertainment and Devices and Server and Tools accounted for over 70% of the absolute revenue growth in the quarter. Healthy PC and server hardware market growth were also key contributors to our results. The PC market grew 8% to 10% in the quarter, driven by a good back-to-school sales season. Consumer growth outpaced that of business, consistent with the trend of the past several quarters. Geographically, we saw double-digit growth in Asia and Latin America, with the remaining regions growing at single digits. Server hardware shipment growth was consistent with our full-year estimate of 10% to 12%. Our mix of product billings was approximately 40% from OEMs; 25% from multi-year licensing agreements; 20% from license-only sales; and the balance from our other businesses. These results were generally consistent with the prior year. We had a good quarter from a volume licensing perspective and saw strong performance in our small and medium business channel in particular. In terms of enterprise agreements, we highlighted in July that there was a relatively small amount of EA contract value up for renewals in the first quarter, which would impact EA. Of the business that was up for renewal, we continued to see EA renewal rates within our historical range of 66% to 75%. Non-annuity growth was relatively weak, as expected, in front of major product launches later this year. Our unearned revenue balance ended the quarter at $10.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year and slightly stronger than we expected. The sequential decline in the unearned balance in the first quarter was driven by the absolute size of our fiscal Q4 annuity billings relative to Q1, as well as the small amount of EA contract value up for renewal, as previously discussed. Our contracted not-billed balance at the end of September was sequentially lower, but continues to exceed $9 billion. Now I'd like to provide revenue highlights by business segment. Starting with Client, revenue for the quarter grew 4% to $3.3 billion. OEM revenue growth of 4% resulted from 11% growth in license units. The 7 percentage point difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth was caused primarily by increasing volumes in emerging markets, the relative strength of the consumer segment of the market, and a $45 million revenue deferral related to the Express upgrade to Windows Vista program. We were particularly pleased with the continued adoption of Windows Media Center Edition, which represented over 15% of OEM license mix in the quarter, and has now sold over 20 million units to date. Client, commercial and retail licensing product growth of 5% was primarily driven by growth in multi-year contract agreements in front of the Windows Vista launch. We made significant progress on Windows Vista development during the quarter, as evidenced by the recent availability of the second release candidate. We made pre-release versions of Windows Vista available to over 5 million customers worldwide. Server and Tools revenue growth of 17% represents the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for the segment. Results for the quarter were driven by broad adoption of our Server and Tools product line, particularly SQL Server, which grew over 30%, Windows Server and Digital Studio. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Softricity, Whale Communications, Winternals Software and DesktopStandard, which will strengthen our growing Server business around virtualization, enterprise security and management. Revenue for our Online Service business was down 4% to $539 million, with 5% advertising growth and a 30% decline in access revenue. Increased advertising revenue was driven by growth in display advertising, offset by lower search revenues. With respect to search, although our search queries grew, our search pricing was below the prior-year levels as a result of the transition to our new adCenter platform, which began in earnest during the December quarter. We experienced sequential growth in revenue per search as we increased the number of advertisers on our platform. During the quarter we also released a number of new or updated Internet services, including Live.com, Live Search, Live Local Search and Live Spaces. Microsoft Business division revenue grew 4% to $3.4 billion, a good result in front of the upcoming product launches of Office 2007 and Exchange Server 2007, and in line with our expectations entering the quarter. As with Windows Vista, we also made considerable progress on the development of the 2007 Office system. We released the Beta 2 technical refresh of the product during the quarter and over 3 million customers have pre-release versions of Office 2007. Business momentum and customer interest for both Office 2007 and Exchange Server 2007 remains strong, leading us to the launches later this year. We also delivered strong performance in our Dynamic business in the first quarter, with customer billings growth of 19%. Lastly, Entertainment and Devices growth of 70% for the quarter was driven by strong performance across all of its businesses. Interactive gaming revenue in particular more than doubled as a result of Xbox 360 platform momentum. We have sold 6 million consoles life to date, and Xbox 360 software and accessory attach rates have remained at record levels in the U.S. relative to any previous console launches from competitors. Momentum for Xbox Live continued to build as well, passing the 4 million member mark during the quarter. In addition to strength in gaming, our Mobile and Embedded Device business recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in excess of 40%, as licenses for Windows mobile-based phones more than tripled. Finally, we announced the next step in our Connected Entertainment division with the coming availability of the Zune digital media player and online service for U.S. consumers starting on November 14. Now for the rest of the income statement. While revenue increased 11% for the quarter, the cost of revenue increased 35%, due primarily to Xbox 360. As a result, gross margin relative to the prior year was down 3 percentage points for the quarter, consistent with the guidance we provided in July. First quarter operating expenses, other than cost of revenue, increased $560 million, or 14%, excluding certain legal charges in the prior year quarter. While we continue to invest aggressively in both R&D and sales and marketing to drive future growth, expenses this quarter were lighter than we expected, primarily due to the timing of marketing program spend. Operating income for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up modestly from the prior year excluding certain legal charges in that year-ago quarter. Investment income and other totaled $567 million, driven by larger than expected gains on investment sales to fund our tender offer during the quarter. Our effective tax rate came in at 31%, slightly higher than the estimate provided to you in our guidance last call, due to the change in the mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions. During the quarter we continued to execute against our strategy of returning capital to shareholders. We repurchased $7 billion of company stock, including nearly $4 billion through our tender offer, and paid out $9 million in dividends during the quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were 10 billion, down 7% from the prior year as a result of execution against our share repurchase program. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.35, $0.03 above the high end of the range we provided in July. So, in summary, Q1 was a good start to fiscal 2007. The solid revenue results for the quarter were at the top end of our expectations, and EPS exceeded our expectations with an exciting and important fiscal year now underway. Chris will now provide you with our expectations for the second quarter and fiscal year 2007.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and the second quarter. Before we get into the specific guidance, let me outline some of our key assumptions. Our fiscal 2007 forecast assumes no major changes in the economic conditions and demand from where we exited the first quarter, and we are not forecasting any significant impacts from foreign exchange rate movements. We expect PC unit growth for fiscal 2007 to be 8% to 10% for the year, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter, and between 6% and 8% for the second quarter. We continue to estimate that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the Consumer segment than in the Business segment, and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. On the server hardware front, we remain comfortable with our estimates for total market growth of 10% to 12% for the year. Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the full year we expect our revenue to come in between $50 billion and $50.9 billion, growing 13% to 15%. We are bringing up our revenue range to reflect how we finished quarter one, as well as also raising the top slightly. Our growth is driven by forward-based revenue growth across our five segments. For the second quarter we expect revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion, which represents quarterly growth of flat to up 5%. There are a couple of items to note when you consider our second-quarter revenue. First, the revenue figures for the second quarter include the impact of us deferring approximately $1.5 billion, primarily from our technology guarantee programs. Again, this simply defers the recognition of revenue from the second quarter into the third quarter. There is no full-year impact of these programs on revenue. Before these impacts, revenue guidance would have been $13.3 billion to $13.9 billion, which represents growth of 12% to 17%. Second, we expect PC unit growth in the second quarter to remain healthy, but moderate from the growth rate we saw in our fiscal first quarter, as well as from the growth rates we saw last year in second quarter. With that, revenue guidance in our five business units is as follows: For Client, we expect full-year growth to be 9% to 10% and second-quarter growth to be down 25% to 27%. This full-year guidance includes the impact of revenue recognition changes for Windows Vista, as was discussed on our call on Tuesday. Our second quarter guidance includes the deferral of approximately $1 billion in revenue out of the quarter and into the third quarter. $1 billion covers revenue associated with both our technology guarantee program, as well as amounts for Windows Vista pre-shipments into the channel ahead of launch. If you were to normalize for the $1 billion of deferrals, second-quarter revenue would be growing 4% to 6%. Looking at the full-year growth, the commercial and retail portion of the Client segment should pick up in the second half due to our launch of Windows Vista targeted for volume licensing customers in November, and with broad availability in January. We expect Client OEM revenue to grow slightly below the PC hardware market for the year, due to increased concentration among larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets. Server and Tools revenue should grow 15% to 16% for the year and 14% to 15% for the second quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth throughout the year from the sustained momentum of SQL Server and from growth in Windows Server, developer tools, our application business, and enterprise services. As we approach the anniversary of the SQL Server and Visual Studio launches, quarterly performance in the second half of the year will face tougher year-over-year comparables. We forecast revenue in the Online Services business to grow between 7% and 11% for the year and to be up 3% to 5% in quarter two. The full-year growth number implies significant year-over-year growth in the second half, based upon growth in both search and display advertising revenues. While we continue to make investments in various aspects of the business, we did make progress on a number of fronts in the quarter. For example, we rolled out the Live Search, which now powers searches on both MSN.com and Live.com, moved our Live Local Search out of beta and into final availability in both the U.S. and the UK, continued to grow and broaden our social networking presence with spaces and the recent beta rollout of Soapbox, and we're making good progress getting advertisers on adCenter, as well as looking at opportunities to extend our reach through partnerships. Microsoft Business division revenues should grow 8% to 9% for the year and be down 8% to 10% in the second quarter. The full year guidance now includes the impact of Dynamics revenue recognition we talked about earlier in the week, and that's close to what we gave you in July. Our second quarter revenue guidance includes approximately $500 million being deferred out of the second quarter and into the third quarter, due to both our technology guarantee program as well as a small amount of revenue associated with Office 2007 pre-shipments into the channel. If you were to normalize for the impact of the technology guarantee program, revenue growth for quarter two would be 3% to 5%. Fiscal 2007 is MBD's biggest year ever for product launches, with major releases in all areas of the business: Office, Exchange, Dynamics, and Office Live. For the Entertainment and Devices division, we're forecasting full year revenue growth of 33% to 46% and second quarter growth of 50% to 75%. With 6 million Xbox 360 consoles sold life to date and a portfolio of 160 high-definition games by the end of the year, we remain optimistic that we will exit the holiday having sold over 10 million units since launch and end our fiscal year having sold 13 million to 15 million units since launch. Operating income for the year is expected to be between $19.1 billion and $19.5 billion, growing 9% to 11%, excluding legal charges taken in fiscal 2006. In the second quarter we expect operating income to be between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion of impact from revenue deferred from our technology guarantee and preshipment. The $1.5 billion results from revenue recognition that is deferred from the second quarter into the third quarter and there's no full year impact to this program to operating income, as we've mentioned. Excluding the impact of the technology guarantee, operating income for the second quarter would be between $4.4 billion  and $4.7 billion. Second quarter operating income includes the impact of higher overall mix of lower-margin hardware revenue from Xbox 360 and Zune, increased costs associated with the Online Services group, as well as operating costs in preparation for the launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Office system. On our last earnings call we gave you additional color and guidance on cost of goods sold, given the evolving mix of our businesses. Even though we may not always do so each quarter, let me give you an update on COGS today. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the second quarter should increase by $0.08 to $0.09 over quarter two of last year. The increase results from a larger number of Xbox 360 consoles, plus the inclusion of Zune units. We're remaining with our previous guidance on the full year being up one to two points. We're also updating our guidance on our effective tax rate for the year. In July we estimated the full year effective tax rate of 30.5%, but due to a change in the mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions, we are now estimating a full year tax rate of 31%, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $1.43 to $1.46, and $0.22 to $0.24 for the second quarter. Second quarter EPS, excluding the impact of the technology guarantee, would have been $0.33 to $0.35. I'm pleased that, as a result of better business results and investment income, we have been able to keep our guidance largely in line with the full year guidance we gave you in July. I'd like to take a moment now to drill down a bit on the makeup of our full-year EPS numbers. We told you back in July that we estimated the impact of the full completion of our tender offer would be $0.05 to $0.06 for the full fiscal year. Since only a portion of the shares were tendered, I wanted to do a quick reconciliation from our full year guidance in July to what we're giving you today. First, instead of buying the previously contemplated $20 billion worth of shares during the quarter through our tender offer, we repurchased a total of $4.8 billion, which comprised of $3.8 billion worth of stock through our tender offer, plus an additional $1 billion we made in open market purchases during the quarter. The lower repurchases will reduce our estimate by approximately $0.03 to both our low and high ranges. Second, offsetting that decrease would be higher operating income associated with better revenue growth, higher investment income for the year, negated somewhat by a higher effective tax rate. We estimate the net impact to add approximately $0.02 on the low-end and $0.01 on the high-end. Finally, the remaining $0.01 improvement to both our low and high end EPS guidance comes from our ongoing buyback activity. As with past practice, we do not intend to share the expected pace of our prospective buyback execution, and it could differ from our expectations embedded in the guidance. We expect unearned revenues to finish fiscal 2007 up 5% to 7%. Contracts not-billed should also finish 2007 up from where we exited fiscal 2006. In thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from quarter one to quarter two, we expect seasonality similar to last year, plus the addition of the 1.5 in revenue associated primarily with our technology guarantee programs. For our full-year unearned revenue guidance, we're modeling a moderation in the recent annuity mix of our billings, as both Office 2007 and Windows Vista will be available to customers in the second half of the year. As we think about our guidance for the rest of the year, many of the risks and opportunities I talked about last quarter still exist. Aside from our normal competitive, legal and general market risks, in particular, PC and server growth rates, we have our share of execution risks in the year. Our plan relies on execution on a number of important product launches starting in the second quarter and extending through the rest of the fiscal year. Customer acceptance of our new products is uncertain and, in particular, customer acceptance of our products such as Xbox 360 and Zune, are particularly difficult to predict during the holiday sales season. Also, the cost of acquiring and serving customers in our online business could increase. Potential upside to our guidance in some cases is a mirror image of our risks. For example, customer acceptance and demand for Windows Vista, the Office 2007 system, Xbox 360 and Zune could exceed our expectations. Customer demand for our hardware products like Xbox 360 and Zune units with a fiscal revenue growth but not necessarily operating income growth. And finally, PC and server hardware shipments could grow faster than we anticipate. Before moving to Q&A, then, I'd like to make a couple of quick comments. We continue to execute well against our strategy for delivering long-term shareholder value. We are committed, and continue to be, to growth through innovation. By investing in innovation across a broad array of high-growth markets, as well as in the development of a services capability to complement our current software offerings, we are positioning the Company to grow operating income faster than our technology peers over the long term. With profitable growth, we generate significant operating cash flow, which enables two very important outcomes: First, it unleashes the virtuous cycle of reinvestment back into our business for further growth. Second, it allows us to advance our financial strategy of returning capital to shareholders. Overall we remain optimistic about our ability to innovate, to generate growth, and as a result of those, to create long-term shareholder value. That wraps up my financial comments. I'd like to hand the call over to Colleen so we can get started with your questions.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini - UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us an idea, what was the premium SKU mix for the first 12 months of the Windows XP launch? What's implicit in your guidance for Vista? As a follow-up, what do you view as negating factors of whether or not Client growth will be faster than PC shipment growth in calendar '07?\nChris Liddell: Thanks very much. In terms of premium SKU mix, we're sticking with what Kevin Johnson told you at FAM, which is we're looking at 52% to 54%  I believe, is what he quoted for the year. That's this fiscal year, so we still feel good about that. Obviously it was higher than in the first quarter. But at this stage we're certainly comfortable with that number. In terms of the calendar year growth, I think, which was the second half of your question, clearly, we are feeling good about growth in revenue in the Client area relative to PC units. So, in the first quarter and the second quarter, revenue growth will lag PC units. But then in the second half of the year, it's actually going to be at or above it, and equal to for the full year. So, we're looking at fiscal year '07, PC units growing at 8% to 10%, and Client revenue growing in fact slightly higher than that, 9% to 10%. That's a result of not only good unit shipments, obviously, but also the positive impacts of our commercial and retail part of the Client business. In terms of XP and premium mix, I'll get one of my colleagues to grab that number. I don't have that at hand straightaway.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan.\nAdam Holt: Two questions on the cost structure for the second quarter. You mentioned that you're going to be able to get some improvements in the Xbox margins. I was wondering if that's coming from software attach or component pricing? Secondly, as we look at the cost that shifted out of the first quarter, it looks like the operating margins, net the impact of the deferrals, were a little bit lower than I was looking for in Q2. Should we assume that entire amount falls in the second quarter, and then that's going to go in the marketing line? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: Sure, Adam. In terms of the better margin for Xbox, it's both those impacts. So, we are seeing lower cost per console, we're coming down the manufacturing cost line, and in fact, we're doing better than what we had hoped for. So, last year we saw slightly higher costs to console than we were expecting; this year, certainly to date, we're experiencing better costs per console. We're sticking, clearly, with our view of being cost-neutral over the console life. This year is shaping up very well. On top of that, we did also get good software attach. So, we saw software attach, I believe, over five for the quarter, which when you spread over the number of units that we sold, meant that our revenue per unit for software was very good in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with that. Also from some of the other sources of revenue, they're not as significant, but, obviously, with the number of people that we're seeing on Xbox Live, we're starting to see some benefit from that. So, all of those are helping with the Xbox margins. In terms of the second half of your question, which was on the operating costs, most of that marketing spend was a shift from quarter one to quarter two. So, you are correct; to the extent that we saved some revenue on OpEx, to a large extent you'll see that in the second quarter. As you'll see from our full year guidance, that's still intact. exactly the same from an overall OpEx point of view. So, there's some spread, I believe, in the third and fourth quarter, but it's primarily a quarter one to quarter two shift.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Charles DiBona - Sanford Bernstein.\nCharles DiBona: Chris, you sound pretty upbeat about the online services group, even though the numbers seem to be going pretty much sideways. Could you give us some insight, other than the product launches, to some of the metrics that you're looking at that give you confidence that this is really headed in the right direction? Maybe it's conversion rates or share or the size of the advertising community, but something that underlies your confidence in that group.\nChris Liddell: The revenue per search is, clearly, the one that we've got closest on our eye at the moment. We look at probably 10 to 12 metrics across that group fairly closely. But in terms of the revenue per search, that is going up sequentially as we get more advertisers onto the adCenter platform. We're close to now lapping where we were when we came off the Overture platform from last year. So, with the revenue expectations that we have in the back half of the year, I am expecting us certainly in the U.S. anyway to equal or go above our revenue per search on a year-over-year basis, not just a quarter-over-quarter basis, and that will help drive revenue in the second half. On the display advertising side, we obviously look at both the volume and the monetization there. Both those figures again, we look at the back half of the year and are expecting that to be pretty good, but from our point of view, those numbers are reasonable as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund - Goldman Sachs.\nRick Sherlund: Chris, if I could take you back to the call you did a couple days ago on the change in accounting for the undelivered elements for Windows versus the Dynamics, where you're going to move to ratable recognition. I wasn't on that call; I was in the air, but I just wanted a chance to come back to that issue. If you could clarify that. So, for Dynamics, starting in the third quarter, we're going to shift to ratable recognition?\nChris Liddell: No, it's in the first quarter for Dynamics.\nRick Sherlund: First quarter of next year?\nChris Liddell: No, the first quarter of this year. There's a full-year impact for this year. And then  obviously, only a couple quarters of impact on the Vista side.\nRick Sherlund: I'm curious about how big that is, because I would think that the Windows change is bigger than the Dynamics change.\nChris Liddell: In absolute terms going forward, in particular as you look forward to fiscal year '08, you'll be absolutely correct. In terms of fiscal year '07, because one is for a full year and the other is only for a part year as the product phases in, then they basically offset each other. As we look to fiscal year '08, you'll see a much more significant impact from the Vista change relative to the Dynamics, obviously, because of the scale of those businesses. When we give you guidance for next year, we will absolutely call that out and be transparent about it. Because as you know, it's purely an accounting change; it doesn't change the underlying economics. So, we will tell you exactly how much of the guidance for next year we anticipate with both of them. And you are right; it will be much more significant for Windows than it will be for Dynamics in fiscal year '08.\nRick Sherlund: The reason for the change in Dynamics, should I anticipate that you're going to move to an on-demand, software-as-a-service model, where you can charge over time and you'd be relatively indifferent from a revenue recognition standpoint, whether it was on premise or on demand?\nChris Liddell: Because it's more in the accounting area, let me just hand over to Frank and he'll give you the technical answer.\nFrank Brod: We have actually changed the way we are marketing the licenses there. In the past we've licensed on a per-module basis. Our new licensing program actually licenses on a per-seat basis. So with that, because all future software and upgrades and functionality are available to the new licensees, we will actually move to a ratable recognition rather than an up-front recognition.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Just a quick clarification on the EPS guidance. So, the tender offer, the shortfall in the buyback on account of that is balanced by the investment income, right? Is that how you get to pretty much the same EPS guidance as before, or am I missing something? I just wanted to clarify that.\nChris Liddell: There's three elements that help us get back. Two downward elements and three upward elements. One is the lower tender, we also have a slightly higher tax rate that we're anticipating for the year. So those, all other things being equal, would lower our EPS guidance for the year. In terms of upward impacts which offset that, we are obviously continuing to buy back shares during the course of the year. We have a better investment income, as you mentioned. But also, we have got better operating income. So, we are guiding to higher revenue, and the benefits of that higher revenues are flowing through to operating income. So, I primarily call out better business performance, which is helping offset some of the lower earnings per share impacts of buyback.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: With the new stiff antipiracy features in Vista, are you assuming similar piracy as in past cycle, or are you expecting a slight improvement with the Vista launch?\nChris Liddell: We're certainly looking at the back half of the fiscal year which is the only one at this stage, clearly, that we're guiding to, to OEM unit sales being higher than PC units as a result of our antipiracy. So, we're looking at, I believe, for the full year something like a 1% to 2% benefit as a result of that. So, we're not looking at significantly different rates relative to XP. Clearly, as we go into fiscal year '08 and onwards, we'll give you some guidance at that stage. But certainly it is helping, but we're already seeing some positive benefits from what we're doing on the XP side.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And the blended ASP, is that fair that  6% to 8% with Vista? Is that a fair rate, or do you think it's a little lower?\nChris Liddell: I'm not sure where you're getting the 16% from, to be honest.\nBrent Thill: No, I'm sorry. 6% to 8%; would that be a fair blended ASP increase with Vista versus XP? Would that be a fair range to assume for an ASP lift?\nChris Liddell: Look, obviously, we're giving or talking about the individual products. At this stage we're not talking about blended rates. We're talking about the premium mix that we expect. But we'll let the market determine what that's going to be in the second half of the year. We have some anticipation in the guidance we've given, but I don't want to comment on a specific number for ASP.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Maynard - Credit Suisse.\nJason Maynard: Just a question about use of cash. There's a lot of acquisitions going on at fairly high prices in the online property space. I'm just curious,  what are your parameters around contemplating a transaction like that, and how you think about some of those larger deals? And also, just maybe as the flip-side of this is what are your plans for CapEx for this fiscal year, and have they changed at all since last quarter?\nChris Liddell: We are very rigorous on the acquisition side. We bought 23 companies last year, and as Colleen mentioned in her statement, we bought four in the first quarter. But we have an incredibly disciplined process for acquisitions that go through a number of stages, and clearly they need to be ROI and economic value-positive. So, you are correct that we are seeing some price inflation in some of the acquisitions that we're talking about. For every one we do, we probably turn down one or two. So, we don't buy everything that we look at and we are selective on not only what we buy, but how much we pay for it. In terms of our attitude going forward on acquisitions, I think we've said a number of times at financial analyst meetings and outside of that, we do see acquisitions playing a role in our growth. So, I would certainly expect us to still buy companies. In the first quarter it tended to be more in the Server and Tools area. Going forward it could well be in the online services area, in particularly with the speed of how that market is developing and some of the opportunities we're being shown, obviously that's a possibility. But we are not going to buy anything that we don't think creates economic value. In terms of CapEx, it's very much in line with what we guided you to in July. So, we're looking at just over $2 billion for the year.  I believe we spent $400 million in the first quarter. In terms of online spend on CapEx, which is one of the areas people are primarily interested in, we're looking at around $700 million for the full year, and we spent about $150 million in the first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McPeake - Prudential.\nJohn McPeake: Back on the undelivered elements, you're now going to be recognizing that revenue versus deferring it. Could you talk a little bit about the give and takes there, with the fact that Vista Enterprise in particular is only available to customers with some sort of an SA or an EA that covers Client, and historically they've been able to buy that from the OEMs?  I'm trying to get a sense as to how those two dynamics play out in the unearned over the course of the year.\nFrank Brod: Your question is about the undelivered elements and the enterprise agreements?\nChris Liddell: In terms of enterprise agreements, we'll still, obviously, ratably spread enterprise agreement income over the life of the contract. So, that won't change. It will only be for the undelivered elements of sales through, in particular, OEMs of the Vista software, where  it's not delivered under a software assurance program; it's delivered under a sale of a PC. When we sell under the sale of a PC, those undelivered elements will not be deferred as they were in XP. So, it doesn't really influence the enterprise agreement recognition, if I'm understanding your question correctly.\nJohn McPeake: That's correct. So, you've got about 15% that used to be deferred in the OEM agreements that's now being recognized. But you also have new SKUs that can only be purchased for the Client business. So, Vista Enterprise in particular, you need to have that covered by an SA. And that's a new thing for Microsoft, so I'm trying to get a sense as to whether that's going to have an incremental positive impact, potentially, over the course of the year to your unearned. So, you have a new SKU that is a Client SKU.\nColleen Healy: If more users find that particular SKU, which you can only get under an SA, very compelling, then yes, you would see more unearned. That's a big assumption to make. But certainly, the accounting there has not changed. To the extent that we see more business done through volume licensing, you would continue to expect to see that same impact on unearned and contracted not-billed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Misek - Canaccord Adams.\nPeter Misek: Just one quick question on other product cycles. We haven't heard an update recently on how the Longhorn server cycle appears to be progressing. Clearly, we're coming to the end of the Vista launch cycle. Can you provide us any update on that product cycle, please?\nChris Liddell: That's still on track for the second half of next calendar year. So, no change for that.\nColleen Healy: Thanks so much. We probably have time for just one or two more questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards.\nKevin Buttigieg: On the forecast for the Server and Tools unit revenue growth of 10% to 12%, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the impact of virtualization on that growth rate? Obviously, you have Microsoft Virtual Server, but perhaps offsetting that might be some lower unit sales of Windows Server. Could you just sort of help form the parameters around virtualization's impact on that business?\nColleen Healy: Our thinking around virtualization is that it's good for customers. We feel like our offerings address those well. The industry is going there, and that's reflected in the hardware server  numbers that you see from the Company. We feel like our pricing is very competitive, especially to other pricing out there; pretty easy to understand, pretty competitive. We think that we're well positioned there, and we welcome ushering it in, and we've got good products there.\nKevin Buttigieg: So, 10% to 12% seems like it sustainable, then, even in light of virtualization's adoption rate?\nColleen Healy: Today we're giving you second quarter fiscal year '07 guidance. But virtualization, we think, is a good thing for the industry. Just like with Moore's Law, getting more power out of your hardware is a good thing for the ecosystem. Great, thanks so much. Time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Laura Lederman - William Blair.\nLaura Lederman: I have two quick questions. One is, can you give us an update on cash flow, what your expectations are for this year? And also, a phenomenal result for SQL Server. Can you talk about where you're particularly seeing strength in that product? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: On the cash flow side, it will follow traditional patterns. Clearly, cash flows for the quarter and the second quarter are impacted to some extent by inventory builds for Xbox, but that will wash itself out through the system. So, when you look at our cash flow for the year, the only real elements of significance are probably slightly higher CapEx. But in the overall scheme of Microsoft, that's not huge. But spending just over $2 billion of CapEx will clearly be an impact on cash flow. Our inventory and working capital should be broadly in line with historic patterns. And then the buyback is the last thing, which will depend to some extent on what we buy in the second half of the year. But other than that, cash flow trends will be typical from what you've seen in previous years.\nLaura Lederman: SQL Server was a great result. Where are you particularly seeing strength? Vertical markets, company size, applications? Just give us some context on why that growth rate is still so strong.\nColleen Healy: I'll take out one, Lauren. So, SQL strong really across the board, as evidenced by 30% growth, really means you do need to have some nice broad strength. We've been particularly delighted in the larger enterprises really looking to SQL for their critical applications. We continue to do well in the mid-size space as well. So, really it's been nice, broad strength there.\nLaura Lederman: What about U.S. versus international?\nColleen Healy: Again, with nice 30% growth, you're going to see really good adoption, really, across the board. Thanks, Laura. And thank you, everyone, for your participation in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call me or my team directly.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me now turn it over to Chris.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Thanks, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start today\u2019s call with a few highlights from the year and then give you an overview of our expectations for fiscal year 2009. Quarter four results capped off an outstanding year for the company in terms of both operating and financial performance. All three of our key financial measures met or exceeded the guidance we provided entering the year, despite a challenging economic environment. For the year, revenue, operating income, and earnings per share increased 18%, 21%, and 32% respectively. Furthermore, the 18% revenue growth represents our fastest annual revenue growth in almost a decade. These results demonstrate the breadth of our business model, revenue growth being fueled by strong customer demand for our products and services across all of our businesses. Our core businesses of client, Microsoft business division, and server and tools turned in fantastic results, growing revenue a combined 15% in the year. The online services business grew revenue 32%, while entertainment and devices division was up 34% for the year. Looking at the fiscal year results from a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 15%. Other mature markets were up 16% and emerging markets grew a tremendous 35%. Now for a couple of key points on our outlook for fiscal 2009, with our planning and budgeting process [in place]. Our revenue and operating income [growth trends] remain relatively consistent with what we told you in April. Specifically, we expect revenue growth of 11% to 13%, operating income growth of 17% to 20%, and earnings per share growth of [13% to 17%]. Since we last gave you guidance, we\u2019ve increased investments in three ways. First, we\u2019ve continued to make a number of important inorganic acquisitions. We\u2019re taking the view that the current environment is in fact a positive one to acquire companies if you are in the fortunate position of having a strong balance sheet and a willingness to take a long-term view. Second, we\u2019ve increased organic investments in operating expenses, driven in particular by a deliberate decision to invest more aggressively in our online services strategy. Last, we remain committed to investing in ourselves through our ongoing share repurchases. For the year, we repurchased over $12 billion of our stock, with $5 billion of that amount occurring in the fourth quarter. One final comment before we get into the details; clearly we\u2019re disappointed that our strong financial results are not reflected in our share price because of general market turbulence combined with Microsoft specific issues, including the uncertainty over the outcome of Yahoo! discussions. In this environment, we remain focused on driving the factors inside our control. In particular, from my perspective, improving long-term earnings per share. I\u2019m satisfied that despite difficult economic conditions, should we achieve the middle of our guidance for fiscal year \u201909, we will have increased our earnings per share from $1.42 to $2.15 in two years, an increase of 50% over that period. With those high level themes for 2008 and 2009, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on how we closed out last year.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. The fourth quarter was a solid finish to an outstanding year. For the quarter we met our top and bottom line guidance, driven by 18% revenue growth. Let me provide you with the details of our financial performance, starting with revenue. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I\u2019ll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. Revenue grew 18% to $15.8 billion, with every business growing in the mid-teens or higher. Our annuity sales mix, which is approximately 40% of our billing revenue, continued to grow on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, with enterprise agreement renewal rates in line with historical trends. The remainder of our product billings for the quarter was approximately 25% from OEM, around 15% from license only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Our unearned revenue grew 21% to $15.3 billion, over $600 million above our high-end guidance. Our contracted not billed balance increased both sequentially and year over year to over $13 billion, about $3 billion above where we started the fiscal year. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company grew 23%, driven by over 20% bookings growth for our core businesses of server and tools, client, and the Microsoft business division. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about four percentage points to our revenue growth. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment, starting with client and its biggest driver, the PC market. We estimate that the PC unit growth rates for the quarter returned to the 12% to 14% range that we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year. This is about three points above our forecast, due to improvements in mature markets, including in the United States. This helps to drive client revenue growth of 15% to $4.4 billion, which was over $150 million above our high-end guidance. During the quarter, our OEM license units increased by 22%, about nine points faster than the overall hardware market. OEM unit growth outpaced that of the PC market, primarily driven by a couple of factors: one, our OEM partners always have channel fluctuations. With this quarter, we estimate were a combination of replenishing the channel from lower Q3 levels as well as buying [hit some] pricing tiers during the quarter; and two, we returned to the trend of making gains on piracy, including in Asia. OEM revenue increased by 13%. The difference between OEM revenue and unit growth is due to three trends, which you are already well familiar: one, volume mix shift towards emerging markets, which generally have lower ASPs; two, channel mix shift towards large OEMs with volume pricing; and three, premium mix shift toward consumer premium offerings. Specifically, while business and consumer premium units were up year-on-year and the overall OEM premium mix remained unchanged from the prior year at 72%, the premium mix composition shifted down four points of business premium and up four points of consumer premium. The remaining roughly 20% of client revenue comes from commercial and retail licensing. This portion of the business grew over 20%, driven by continued strength in client annuity licensing as business customers continued to demand our enterprise offerings, including those that help them more efficiently manage their desktop infrastructure. During the quarter, we surpassed the 180 million for Windows Vista licenses sold to date and Windows Vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16% since it became generally available. Moving to server and tools, revenue was $3.7 billion, growing an outstanding 21% on top of the string of Q4 double-digit growth quarters. And this quarter marks the group\u2019s 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. [inaudible] for annuity contracts, covering our [server and tools] offerings continued during the quarter, driving server and tools unearned revenues increased 37% from the beginning of the year. This customer commitment to annuity contracts demonstrates the increasingly critical role our server products perform in information technology infrastructure, as well as an increasing interest in the value offered in our long-term product roadmap. Demand for our consulting and support services remains strong, driving associated revenue growth of 30%. On the product side during the quarter, we released our eagerly anticipated virtualization feature, Hyper-V, two months ahead of schedule. We also made significant progress on SQL Server 2008, which is targeted for release during this, the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Online services business grew revenue 24% to $838 million. Online advertising grew 18%, including $33 million of ad revenue from aQuantive. While both search queries and page views were up and in line with expectations, monetization lagged, driven by tightening advertising budgets combined with a more competitive display pricing environment. We continued to attract users to our properties with live IDs hitting 460 million, up 80 million from last year. And we grew the number of advertisers utilizing our advertising platform by 28% during the year. We closed the acquisitions of FairCast, which offers technology to aid in the purchase of online tickets at the lowest price, and Navic Networks, which develops tools to deliver targeted ads to television set-top boxes. In May, we announced the beta launch of Live Search Cashback. Since then, we have 680 merchants participating in the program with about 200,000 registered users. Microsoft business division revenue was up 14% to $5.3 billion. The business element of MBD revenue grew almost $700 million, or 19% on both strong enterprise agreement signings and license only sales. Consumer revenue declined $66 million, down 7%. This reflects both a difficult comparison to last year\u2019s quarter following the Office 2007 launch, and a continuation of a shift towards our lower price consumer SKUs. Our emerging business product momentum continues, with SharePoint revenue up over 30% and unified communications revenue up over 20%. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer, expanding our spectrum of enterprise search solutions for customers. Our Dynamics business also had a good quarter, with customer billings growth of 22% and two product releases, Dynamics AX2009 and Dynamics CRM Online. Dynamics CRM continues to deliver the function and flexibility customers want, evidenced by over 120,000 CRM seats being sold in the quarter. Entertainment and devices division grew revenues 37% to $1.6 billion. We sold 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles, representing 88% growth over the prior year and passing the milestone of 20 million consoles sold life to date. In May, we announced that Xbox Live reached 12 million members, roughly doubling in membership for each of the last two years. Software attach rate continued to lead the industry at 7.7 software titles per console. As was evident at E3 earlier this week, the interactive entertainment business was extremely busy during the quarter, securing industry-leading media content providers such as Netflix, NBC, Universal, Constantine, MGM International, as well as developing innovative new gaming and social experiences that will continue to expand our audiences. The mobility business within the entertainment and devices division completed the acquisition of Danger and released System Center Mobile Device Manager 2008, which has created the opportunity for our sales force to partner with customers\u2019 IT departments, helping them manage their mobile device assets with capabilities similar to those already used to manage PCs. And Microsoft Surface moved into early commercial deployment in AT&T stores and [inaudible], [as you know.] Now for the rest of the income statement: adjusting last year for the impact of the $1.1 billion charge related to the expansion of the Xbox 360 warranty policy, cost of revenue as a percent of sales increased one point to 18%, driven by increasing Xbox 360 console sales, costs associated with the growth of our consulting and support services, as well as data center equipment and online content expenses in our online services business. Operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 19%, driven primarily by headcount related costs, acquisition related expenses, and marketing related expenses. Expenses came in $500 million higher than our guidance, split rather evenly between cost of revenue and operating expenses. First, cost of revenue; we sold more Xbox 360 consoles than our guidance had reflected. In server and tools, the higher revenue growth in our consulting and support services carries higher associated costs than does software revenue. In our online services business, we were able to bring servers in our data centers online faster than expected and we invested in premium online content, which is [higher creative and agency fees associated with it]. Moving on to operating expenses, we took advantage of the economic environment out there to attract top talent for the company, yielding higher close rates and filling headcount openings. Also, across a number of our businesses, we spent more on product development and efforts to ready marketing campaigns, and foreign currency rates presented some headwind. Operating income was $5.7 billion, up 42% or 13% after adjusting for the impacts of the warranty related charge in the year-ago period. Investment income and other totaled $284 million, as the Microsoft treasury team continues to successfully navigate a challenging capital market environment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, a couple points lower than expected, driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. During the quarter, we repurchased 171 million shares, or almost $5 billion of company stock, and paid out about $1 billion in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding were $9.4 billion, down 3% from the prior year, as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share were $0.46, in line with our guidance and growing 48%, or 18% after adjusting for the warranty related charge in the prior year. So in summary, we had our fastest growing fourth quarter revenue since 1999. Adjusting of the year-ago Xbox warranty charge, operating income and EPS grew 13% and 18% respectively. With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our first quarter and full year guidance for fiscal 2009.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. I\u2019m going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we see coming for the full year and for the first quarter. Let me begin by outlining some of our key assumptions around the economy and general demand in the industry. The forecast generally assumes a continuation of the economic conditions and demand we experienced in the fourth quarter to continue into the first half of fiscal year \u201909, with some improvement over the second half of the year. We expect PC unit to remain healthy with growth rates similar to those in 2008. Specifically, we expect PC unit growth in fiscal 2009 to be 12% to 14% for the year and between 10% to 12% for the first quarter. We estimate that growth rates will continue to be driven by roughly 20% growth in emerging markets, with high-single-digit growth in mature markets. Now let me go through our detailed guidance; for the full year, we expect our revenue to come in between $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion, growing 11% to 13%. For the first quarter, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion to $14.9 billion, which represents an increase of 7% to 8%. With that, revenue guidance by business group is as follows: for client, we expect full year growth to be 9% to 10% and Q1 growth to be 6% to 7%. The PC market growth will outpace that of client revenue because of a continuation of the underlying PC market dynamic, namely emerging market PC growth outpacing mature markets, consumer growth exceeding business growth, and the shift in the system build channel to large OEM. Server and tools revenue should be up 18% to 19% for the year and 19% to 20% for the first quarter. Coming off another impressive year of growth in fiscal year \u201908, the server and tools business is expected to continue to show double-digit growth across the breadth of our server platform products and services, driven by strong customer demand for the recently refreshed Windows Server and Digital Studio offerings, and the soon-to-be-available SQL Server 2008. We forecast revenue in the online services business to increase 18% to 20% for the year, and 7% to 11% for the first quarter. The advertising component of revenue is expected to grow at approximately 25% for the year and 15% for the quarter. Our Q1 guidance assumes the continuation of the challenging online advertising market experienced in the fourth quarter. We expect revenue growth will accelerate through the year as we begin seeing returns from the additional investments we are making in the business. Our business division revenue should be up 14% to 15% for the year and 15% to 16% in the first quarter. We should continue to see business demand for Microsoft Office 2007, SharePoint, and Dynamic products. Combined with growth in our emerging unified communication and business intelligence offering, this will drive another year of very strong growth. Fiscal 2009 also represents an important year in delivering on our software for services strategy, with the upcoming releases of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Office Communications Online later this calendar year. For the entertainment and devices division, we expect revenue to be down 4% to flat for the full year, and down 23% to 26% in Q1. The strong customer demand for Halo 3 following its launch in fiscal 2008 makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons in the entertainment and devices division. But having said that, we remain committed to a profitable performance in fiscal year \u201909. Turning back to company wide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between $26.3 billion and $26.9 billion, increasing 17% to 20%, or 10% to 12% excluding certain tax and legal charges in fiscal 2008. For the first quarter, we expect operating income to be between $5.9 billion and $6 billion. Q1 operating income includes the impact of increased spending associated with our online services business, costs associated with a number of new acquisitions, and investments in a new Windows consumer marketing campaign. I would like to address the overall level of -- the impact of the overall level of spending on the company margin. To do so, as I\u2019ve told you before, we need to look at the three individual parts of the company that have distinct margin structures. The core businesses of client, server and tools, and Microsoft business division collectively will have an operating margin in fiscal 2009 that\u2019s essentially flat. This performance is obviously very good, given that we are making a number of investments to drive the overall health of the business and absorbing a number of acquisitions we\u2019ve made this year and growing revenue in mid-teens. The margin for entertainment and devices should also remain roughly the same year-on-year in fiscal year \u201909, even without a first party game release of Halo 3\u2019s magnitude. So taken together, our businesses representing over 90% of our revenue will grow double-digits next year with the margin structure intact. Clearly the online services business has a totally different dynamic and is in a period of significant investment. We do not make these investments lightly, as the loss in this division will be a drag on an otherwise exceptionally good performance. However, we believe that the additional investments of several hundreds of millions of dollars is worth the short-term cost, given the opportunity to participate in a market where the opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of dollars. So I wanted on the call to take a few minutes to frame our reasoning behind the additional online service business investments. I will start with an overview of our broad strategy and then provide details into the additional investments. With the online ad spending expected to reach $80 billion by 2012, this area represents one of the largest growth opportunities for the company. We segment the market for online advertising in four distinct categories -- search, advertising platforms, information content, and communication and social networking. For search, we\u2019re focused on driving query share improvements and business model innovation, specifically in the area of high value commercial search. Our recent release of Cashback is a good example of executing on our strategy, which combines innovation in the shopping experience with a shift in the distribution of advertiser economic towards the end users. Additionally, we also [seek to win] targeted distribution through OEMs, ISPs, ISVs, and retailers. The recently announced deal with HP in the U.S. is an example of [this]. Turning to the ad platform, our strategy can be summarized as consolidate [when in] display, and there we are focused on integrating our advertising assets into a single comprehensive system that can deliver our publishing partners\u2019 industry leading yields and our advertisers optimal return on their ad spend. In the area of communication and social networking, which includes our mail, messenger, and social networking assets, such as Spaces, we\u2019ll deliver the leading end-to-end experiences across the PC, phone, and web. And finally, in the category of information content, we plan to invigorate our MSN portal experience with improvements in user experience, social media consumption, and premium content. As well as overall advertising revenue, which is clearly the overall measure of success, we have aggressive growth targets in each of the above areas over the next five to 10 years. These targets can be broken down in terms of the percentage of share of worldwide page views, percentage of share of Internet [inaudible], the percentage share of search queries, and percentage of the growth of the online advertising dollars that pass through our platform. Clearly the Yahoo! transaction, which I\u2019ll make some more comments on later, would have accelerated our progress towards these goals. However, during the quarter, a transaction became increasingly unlikely. Further, as you know, during the quarter Yahoo! signed a search outsourcing agreement with Google. Given that environment, we made some decisions to accelerate our online services\u2019 organic growth strategy. Mainly we decided to increase our investment in the high-margin scalable areas of search and ad platforms. So about two-thirds of the incremental spend that we are planning is related to investments to drive usage of our search offering. We\u2019re dialing up our search distribution initiatives with targeted OEM toolbar [alt] search deals, scaling search globally with investments in localized engineering and data centers, pursuing acquisitions and partnerships to build vertical content to support our commercial strategy, accelerating the rollout of our Cashback program, and increasing marketing in the business to grow awareness and drive traffic. Second, we are upping the investments in our ad platform and increasing the number of advertisers and high quality inventory on that platform. Specifically, these investments are in the area of accelerating the integration of our ad platform assets, expanding our sales and service capabilities, small acquisitions to enhance the platform technology, and investments in strategic partnerships to increase third-party inventory available to advertisers on our ad platform. So turning to EPS, our diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to come in at $2.12 to $2.18, representing growth of 13% to 17%, two to four points faster than revenue. To put this performance in context, as I mentioned at the front of the call, if we achieve the middle of our guidance, we\u2019ll have increased earnings per share from $1.42 to $2.15 in two years, an increase of 50%. But first quarter we expect earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48, and these earnings assume an effective tax rate of 28%. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2009 up 8% to 9%. [Contracts not filled] should also finish 2009 up from current levels. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from Q4 fiscal year \u201908 to Q1 fiscal year \u201909, we expect a sequential decrease from Q4 to Q1 to exceed the rate of decline we experienced the last few years. As always, when thinking about the guidance we provide, you should also consider the risks. These include competitors, legal, execution and general market risks such as foreign exchange rate movements, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spending, changes in the piracy rate, and customer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between annuity and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income, and EPS by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. So in closing, the strong results of fiscal year \u201908 were the outcome of both business and engineering execution. In addition to the financial out-performance, we delivered the final phase in our multi-year product refresh cycle with the availability of Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008, and are well-positioned to continue that momentum into fiscal 2009. The next fiscal year will be an important year, driving mass adoption across the portfolio of products. With our breadth of products and global diversification, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver double-digit revenue increases even off our base of over $60 billion, and we will continue to use our strong cash flow to invest in our organic growth, inorganic growth through acquisitions, and in ourselves through buy-backs. Before I hand the call back to Colleen, I want to take a moment to clarify the terms of our recent proposal for a search transaction with Yahoo!. Given the upcoming Yahoo! shareholder meeting, I won\u2019t be taking any questions on this topic in the Q&A section that will follow this presentation and we won\u2019t be providing any additional comments on matters we\u2019ve already discussed. But with that, let me outline for you the key elements of our proposal. Firstly, we are providing significant revenue guarantees. Microsoft proposed a 10-year minimum revenue guarantee totaling between $19.5 billion and $26.5 billion. For the first five years, the guarantee is $2.3 billion per year. There afterwards, both Yahoo! and Microsoft have the option to extend the agreement for an additional five-year period. If Yahoo! unilaterally chooses to extend the agreement, the guarantee would be for $1.6 billion per year after the extension. Conversely, if Microsoft unilaterally chooses to extend the agreement, the guarantee to Yahoo! would be $3 billion per year after the extension. These guarantees are not conditional on Yahoo!\u2019s search queries, but rather the guarantees are tied to Yahoo!\u2019s homepage performance. Our proposal includes an 85% TAC rate for the first three years of the agreement and 70% there afterwards. Microsoft would pay Yahoo! $1 billion for its search assets, provide $2.8 billion of senior debt to Yahoo! on favorable terms, and make a significant equity investment in Yahoo! through the purchase of $3.9 billion of Yahoo! stock at $19.50 per share, reflecting our view of the value of the company as a result of our proposed transaction and the distribution of cash and the Yahoo! Asian investments by Yahoo! to its stockholders. I should also note that Microsoft\u2019s proposal did not and does not include changes to Yahoo!\u2019s governance. We clearly continue to believe that our proposal is a compelling one. With that, I am going to hand the call back to Colleen so we can get started taking your questions, and I clearly look forward to seeing a number of you at our financial analyst meeting, which is next Thursday.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. Let\u2019s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourselves to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSara Friar: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, just firstly, could you give us a little bit of your overview on the macro environment and how that\u2019s changed when you think back to giving earnings three months ago? And then, just on your cash flow, it came in a little weaker than we were anticipating. DSOs were up higher than we have seen in perhaps ever for Microsoft. Was there a collections issue, more back-end loading? If you could perhaps talk to the weakness there.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure. Okay, taking those in turn, in terms of the macro environment, it\u2019s broadly speaking the same as what we were expecting in April. Clearly people are getting concerned now about the length of softness here in the U.S., but as you\u2019ve seen for revenue, we\u2019ve taken it up slightly since April, so in terms of the visibility into our products, we are actually feeling very good about our position, not only here in the U.S. but outside the U.S. I mentioned in my comments, if you look at the company overall, our sales in the U.S. in the year that we just completed were up 15%. The company overall is up 18% so clearly we grew faster outside the U.S. than we did inside the U.S., but at 15%, given it\u2019s been a difficult environment for a number of companies, growing at 15% off our base was very good. So going into next year, we are clearly cautious like everyone is about the impact of the environment but for our products overall, we are feeling very good. I\u2019d say the one proviso to that is in the online advertising space, where we are seeing a direct impact. It was weak in the fourth quarter and I think you are seeing from results of other companies as to the weakness in that general space. So there is a direct impact and we are not immune to that in the online space and we\u2019ll probably see that continuing certainly for the next quarter. But overall in terms of our core business growth, it feels very good. In terms of your other questions on cash flow, the biggest thing in the cash flow that was probably a negative was the payment of the fine to the E.U., which was over $1 billion, so -- $1.5 billion, so that was clearly a big negative from a cash flow point of view. Other than that, there really wasn\u2019t anything remarkable from a cash flow point of view. In fact, it was quite a strong quarter, given the results overall.\nColleen Healy: And on a DSO standpoint, Q4 seasonally does tend to be a little higher than some of the other quarters. We do close a lot of business in our fiscal Q4 as the sale force is out there closing deals. But we didn\u2019t see anything unusual from a DSO standpoint.\nChristopher P. Liddell: But overall, I\u2019d say revenue growth of 18% last year, guiding to revenue growth of 11% to 13%, so you combine those and so that\u2019s 30% broadly for the two years that cover what was hopefully the worst of the economic condition, so we\u2019re feeling good about it.\nSara Friar: Okay. And there were -- okay, thanks.\nColleen Healy: Okay, thanks, Sara. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Good afternoon. I was just wondering, Chris, if you could talk a little bit about the OSB business. Given how far behind you guys are, if you\u2019re unsuccessful in getting all or even a part of Yahoo!, can you walk us through how you are going to be able to compete with Google? And also, are we in a critical period here in this segment where if you continue to go down the path of going it alone that we are going to be seeing this accelerating spending from current levels so that it\u2019s going to adversely impact overall op-margin, so we\u2019re actually not going to see op-margins expand for the next few years? Thanks.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure. Okay, overall, clearly regardless of what happens with Yahoo!, it\u2019s a space that we\u2019re committed to. I said that in the prepared remarks and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re committed to on a long-term basis. I would split the market, as I did in my prepared remarks, into four areas, of which search is only one -- ad platform, communications, central networking, and information content being the other ones, and clearly we have a very good position in information content and communications in an ad platform with the acquisition of aQuantive. So we feel very good about our relative position in those areas and a number of our investments are going into that. In the search area, clearly that\u2019s the one where, relatively speaking, we are the most behind and that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a different approach, which again I mentioned in the prepared remarks where we are focusing in particular on the areas of search where there\u2019s a strong commercial intent, our verticals like retail, travel, real estate, local. We\u2019re looking at different approaches where we might potentially take a disruptive and innovative business model, for example, Cashback, and then looking at winning distribution deals. Now in the short-term, that isn\u2019t going to make the division profitable and I think clearly from our guidance, that\u2019s not the case. So as I said in the remarks, if you look at the operating margin structure of the company, you really have to look at the three distinct businesses. We feel good about the margin structure for our core businesses in particular growing double-digit revenue on. Entertainment and devices will be broadly flat but online is going to be negative --\nHeather Bellini: Chris, yeah, I totally get what you are saying. I guess the question that I\u2019m getting asked a lot is how long are you going to spend -- you are obviously performing well on the top line but your spending the upside so that people aren\u2019t getting margin expansion. I guess the question that I\u2019m getting asked is how long should we expect that to continue?\nChristopher P. Liddell: We\u2019re not going to make -- certainly on this call we\u2019re not going to give guidance for fiscal year \u201910 and \u201911. Some of these investments that we are making will be multi-year, so it will depend to a large extent on our revenue growth as to when that division becomes profitable. So it will need to continue to grow relatively substantially in order to cover the level of investments that we are making, but it is going to be, and I think we\u2019ve made this point on previous calls, it is going to be an investment [in the] area, in particular things like the ad platform, where we see it converging to two natural players over time, of which we clearly would expect to be one, and that\u2019s an area where spending in particular on infrastructure is likely to be high. So I can\u2019t promise you that you are going to see a massive turnaround in the short-term, and certainly in fiscal year \u201909, which is the year that we are guiding to today, it is going to be a continuation of an investment. But again, put it in the context of what we would describe as the overall opportunity and the size of the company overall.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Heather. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein.\nCharles Di Bona: I would like to circle back to the Q4 results and really particularly the margins here -- I think the Xbox issue is fairly straightforward but in something like five of the last eight Q4s, you guys have had an issue about being disappointing on margins, and maybe you can give us some color and comfort on what sort of looks to be a fairly persistent control issue in Q4, and in some cases it looks like you might be pulling some of the expenses forward. Are we going to see that in the fiscal \u201909 numbers?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I always distinguish, Charlie, between the costs, which were, if you like, a function of the revenue, a function of decisions that we made, and functions of unexpected low quality spend, if you like. But I can give you some comfort -- it\u2019s the areas that we spent more of in the fourth quarter were more [inaudible] in the first two. For example, on the revenue side, we sold more Xboxes, so we had more COGS. That\u2019s good news, okay? We don\u2019t make any money from those but overall in terms of long-term health of the business, the more consoles we sell, the better. In server and tools, the higher enterprise services revenue carries higher COGS with it -- again, that\u2019s just a factor of it. So the mix inside server and tools might not be as strong as you would like from a revenue point of view, but that\u2019s just a natural consequence. In terms of decisions that we made, we have budgeted headcount and people hired to their budgeted levels. That\u2019s a good thing in the sense that we actually hired people that we want to hire and we were particularly successful. I think that\u2019s a reflection to a large extent of the economic environment and the fact that if anything at the moment, we are an even more attractive company than we have been to people. So again, that hits us from an expense point of view, but I\u2019d describe it in one of the categories, you know, it\u2019s a conscious decision to hire people. In terms of things that were outside our control, FX was a factor. FX has been our friend pretty much throughout the year in terms of driving more revenue upside than more expense, net net it\u2019s been a positive, clearly because we have more revenue outside the U.S. than we do expenses. In the fourth quarter, it was an unusual quarter in that we hired a lot of people outside the U.S. and the mix of expenses was such that the FX impact was higher on OpEx than it was on revenue. If you look across the year, that\u2019s not the case but in the quarter, it was. So I\u2019m comfortable that there\u2019s not any lack of control over spending. Most of the decisions I\u2019ve talked about were either conscious ones or were a reflection of better revenue performance in certain areas.\nColleen Healy: Great, thanks, Charlie. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. It looks like stepping up investments in the online services business seems like the right thing to do. I\u2019m just curious, Chris, what -- I would have expected that to be accompanied by an increase to the revenue guidance, yet when you look back over the last 12 months, if I exclude aQuantive, I still come up with much faster revenue growth in the online services business. So my question is, is the return on these investments going to take more than one year sort of a lag to show up in the financials, or is there some conservatism in how you are budgeting for the revenue productivity as a result of these investments? Is there a longer lag to these OpEx investments? And also, maybe three of our seconds of your thoughts on client guidance. I know Colleen didn\u2019t want multi-part questions, but I couldn\u2019t resist this; the 6% to 7% growth absent currency looks to be very low on the 2% to 3%, so I\u2019m just curious what was the thought process that went into that guidance as well. Thanks.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Okay, sure. Kash, you went blank through the start of your question, so if I don\u2019t cover it exactly, please come back to me. We missed just the first few words of your question, but in terms of online spending, is it likely to be more of a fiscal year \u201910 impact on revenue? The answer is yes, and that\u2019s not only because of the nature of some of the investments that we are making. Things like marketing Cashback, that\u2019s going to take time in terms of seeing the real impact from that. But also, just because -- as I mentioned I think to Sara\u2019s question, the online advertising area is probably the part of the business certainly in the short-term which we think is most challenging. From an economic environment point of view, we have actually done remarkably well in our commercial businesses and overall for PCs, getting through difficult and choppy economic waters. The online advertising area is very difficult at the moment and I think that\u2019s across the board. That\u2019s not just us, so I don\u2019t want to promise -- you know, we might see benefits, for example, in share but I\u2019m not sure that share is necessarily [in best display] in the search area. Again, it translates in the -- certainly in the first six months and possibly across the year to significant revenue growth but I think you could expect to see us make progress in the areas that I talked about, which is the underlying dynamics, the driver of the -- percentage minutes, percentage share, et cetera. That\u2019s really how we are going to have to measure ourselves over the next year. I think the second half of your question was client-specific, is that right?\nKash Rangan: That\u2019s correct, yes.\nChristopher P. Liddell: In the 6% to 7%, yeah, that is relatively light. To some extent, it\u2019s because of the very high, strong quarter one that we had last year. If you\u2019ll recall, we had a very strong quarter one piracy performance in last year. It\u2019s also part of the strong Q4 performance from this year, which Colleen mentioned in the prepared remarks, was some channel inventory. We -- if you like, it was a very strong unit growth in quarter four fiscal year \u201908. Some of that was because of a weak Q3. You\u2019ll recall our Q3 call, we talked about some of the inventory issues there and that was one of the reasons why Q3 of last year was weak. So it feels like a bit of a borrowing from Q3 into Q4, and also we think a little bit of some of our customers may have bought forward from Q1 into Q4 as well, so that\u2019s one of the reasons. The other is we\u2019ve got 10% to 12% PC unit growth expectation, which relative to the year of 12% to 14%, we\u2019re just seeing that quarter as being one of the low points. So you combine all of those factors and we think that\u2019s going to be the lowest revenue growth quarter for client in the year.\nColleen Healy: Great, thanks a lot, Kash. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Chris, the overall buy-back for \u201908 was more than cut in half from \u201907. Obviously that\u2019s understandable considering the acquisition strategy, but I guess as it relates to the overall plan, you only have $3 billion left on the current $36 billion plan. How aggressive at 25 and change will you be with the stock here?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Okay, yeah -- going backwards and then going forwards, backwards -- yes, you are right, it was lower than the previous year. One of the reasons for that is we were getting down to a level of cash that we feel more comfortable with, so there was some accelerated buying in the previous year. The other impact was we see that the aQuantive acquisition, which was relatively expensive this year, and the last factor is when we announced the Yahoo! acquisition earlier this year, we went out of the market but from a sensitivity point of view, and clearly at that stage we\u2019re envisaging having to use a large part of that cash for the acquisition. Subsequent to May when it was clear that the overall transaction wasn\u2019t going to happen, we went back into the market and we have been buying at levels that are more like historic levels. So those are the reasons why we\u2019ve been less in the year. It was $5 billion I believe for the quarter, so it was a reasonably strong buy-back quarter. Clearly at these prices, it\u2019s incredibly attractive from a buy-back perspective. I can\u2019t tell you, as I never do on a quarter by quarter basis exactly how much we will buy back. You\u2019re right that we only have about $3 billion worth of our buy-back left. That\u2019s good news in the sense that I think we gave ourselves until 2012 to complete it, so we can put it at a little ahead of schedule. What we do here is we complete the current buy-back, and then we go back to the board for authorization of any subsequent buy-back, and that would be exactly the process that we do here and if and when we get authorization from the board to do further buy-backs, we\u2019d clearly announce the amount at that stage. But similarly wouldn\u2019t announce exactly the shape of what we do. But clearly the value of the company relative to the last three years is as good as it\u2019s been.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Brent. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. I have a question about Office and MBD. Obviously Office 2007 has been a terrific product cycle, but MBD has been a little bit light relative to guidance for the last couple of quarters. Could you maybe talk about where you think we are in the Office 2007 cycle, and what gives you confidence that we\u2019ll see a reacceleration of growth in MBD next year versus what we saw in the back half of this year?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Well overall, obviously the MBD division did extremely well last year, so put that in context but you\u2019re right in the sense that Office was slightly lighter than we might have thought, mainly to be honest in the consumer area, and that\u2019s around lower price SKUs in retail. So we\u2019re seeing more of a buy from the volume that we\u2019re seeing. The volumes are very good and business sales are very good but the volumes in the retail side tend to be more in the lower priced SKUs, so that\u2019s having an impact overall. But the overall volume and the overall adoption and reaction to Office 2007 has been extremely good, so we feel good and we\u2019ve put it inside our business group, which grew at 15% to 20% last year.\nAdam Holt: So as we look at it next year, should we be thinking about dynamics and share points being the key drivers, or should we expect office to reaccelerate?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I think those emerging products are certainly going to make a big difference. We\u2019re guiding 14% to 15%. That\u2019s very good. I mean, Office is unlikely to grow at 14% to 15%. It\u2019s likely to grow at more like high to single digits. But the other parts of the business will grow extremely well, and that is going to average it up to 14% to 15%, so you\u2019re right. SharePoint, Office Communications, some of the online services that we are bringing in will start to have an impact. So overall, it\u2019s now our biggest division in terms of revenue, 14% to 15% looks very good.\nAdam Holt: Terrific. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Adam. Our next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC.\nRobert Breza: Just looking at the $500 million in expenses that you are talking about, how should we think about that trending through the year? And then, depending on any outcome from an acquisition perspective, would you look to accelerate that investment or decelerate that investment? Thanks.\nChristopher P. Liddell: It has slightly different dynamics. In terms of the consumer marketing, that\u2019s probably going to be front loaded in the year, and one of the reasons for our first quarter being relatively light compared to the other quarters would be some of the marketing spend that we see in the first quarter. In terms of some of the online spending, that\u2019s probably going to be more progressive through the year. In terms of acquisitions, that\u2019s really going to be opportunistic. We closed a lot in the fourth quarter, and one of the things that is impacting our results is clearly the amount of non-cash amortization associated with acquisitions, and that was relatively substantial last year. It was over $300 million. We don\u2019t call that out, as some companies do, and take the benefit of adjusting our results to reflect that. We take that probably through the P&L and next year in terms of the guidance we\u2019ve given you, we expect it to be more than $300 million. How much more and exactly the shape will depend on acquisitions. We have an expectation of it that we build in and -- but it will grow progressively through the year. It\u2019s all non-cash but we\u2019ll continue to take the full impact through the P&L.\nRobert Breza: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Robert, and our last question, please, Operator.\nOperator: The last question comes from Kirk Materne with Banc of America Securities.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. Chris, you talked in the guidance just on entertainment and devices about maintaining profitability. Given that there\u2019s no sort of new cycle of the hardware this year, is there any reason why profitability shouldn\u2019t start to trend up as attach rates get better? Is there anything going on in that business that\u2019s going to require say more advertising dollars or spending in that?\nChristopher P. Liddell: One of the impacts obviously as we dropped prices during the course of last year, so year-on-year we have slightly difficult price comparisons. The other thing is there\u2019s more than just X-Box sitting in there. There\u2019s obviously Windows Mobile, which has got a lot of opportunities, so there are other areas that we will be spending on. We aren\u2019t in the comments of today giving any guidance on profitability. My comment was simply that it will sustainable profitability, but we\u2019re not saying whether that\u2019s going to be significantly up or down from where it was last year.\nKirk Materne: Okay. Thanks very much.\nColleen Healy: Thank you and thank you to everyone for your participation in today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call me or my team directly. We\u2019re very much looking forward to seeing you at our financial analyst meeting next week.

Okay with that, let me now turn it over to Chris.\nChris Liddell: Thanks Colleen and good afternoon everyone. The sense of our third quarter results demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model. As you will see our broad span across geographies, product categories and customer segments is a tremendous asset in any economic environment and produced third quarter results of 14% revenue growth normalized for the tech guarantee and 27% earnings per share adjusted for the tech guarantee, legal charges and tax benefits beating our earnings per share guidance by $0.02 to $0.04. Let me mention a few highlights about third quarter performance before turning to guidance. When looking at the drivers of revenue growth this quarter it\u2019s clear that we are reaping the benefits of the diversification of our business. In the first two quarters of the year our core business of client and the Microsoft business division significantly outperformed our expectations and this quarter entertainment and devices division drove our results. Despite the tough economic environment this has allowed us to deliver consecutive earnings per share growth of 29%, 32% and 27% this year adjusted for the tech guarantee, legal charges and tax benefits. Revenue growth in the client and Microsoft business division businesses were normalized for the prior year results for the impacts of the tech guarantee and retail launch spikes had combined growth of $700 million or 9%. Server and tools had yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth while kicking off our largest enterprise product launch in the company\u2019s history. Our consumer businesses of entertainment and devices division and online service business grew revenue of combined 57% or over $850 million. And the treasury department continued to take some work delivering investment income exceeding our forecast and managing to avoid any significant write-offs in our portfolio despite the [massive] dislocation in the financial markets. In the fourth quarter we expect a strong finish to what has been an excellent year. Revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year remain largely in line with our January guidance and significantly above our expectations upon entering the year. Since this time last year our revenue outlook for fiscal year \u201908 has increased by about $3 billion, operating income margins are expected to expand by over a point and earnings per share guidance is higher by $0.18. On a more macro level there has been some uncertainty regarding the strength of the IT spending environment but our business has remained robust in the face of that uncertainty. While clearly no business can be immune from the impact of an economic slowdown, we remain confident in the benefits of our diversified business model and the investment approach we have taken in recent years. We\u2019ve delivered earnings per share results above the high end of our guidance every quarter this year and have raised our full year earnings per share guidance in each quarter. We are not expecting earnings per share growth of 33% to 35% this year normalized for legal charges and tax benefit which is an outstanding achievement in the current economic environment. With those high level themes I\u2019m going to turn over the call to Colleen for more details of our third quarter performance.\nColleen Heally: Thanks Chris. It was an excellent quarter with normalized revenue and operating income growth of 14% and 15% respectively. Normalized EPS growth at 27% was five points above high end guidance. Revenue growth was driven by continued enterprise customer demand for our core products as well as consumer demand for products and services in the entertainment and devices division and our online services business. Let me provide you with details of our financial performance starting with revenue. I\u2019ll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow with revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I\u2019ll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. Revenue was $14.5 billion. Adjusting the year-ago quarter by the $1.7 billion of revenue recognition primarily related to the technology guarantee programs from Windows Vista and Office 2007 total revenue grew 14%. We estimate PC unit growth rates moderated from our January expectations by a couple of points in mature markets partially offset by an extra point of strength in emerging markets resulting in an estimate of approximately 8% to 10% for the entire PC market during the quarter. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, 30% from multi-year agreements, 25% from license only sales and the balance from our other businesses. Annuity sales mix continued to increase on both a year-over-year and sequential basis while enterprise agreement renewal rates were in line with historical trends. As we guided our unearned revenue balance was consistent with historical seasonality patterns and remained roughly flat on a sequential basis at $12.1 billion up 18% year-over-year. Our contracted not billed balance remains above $11.5 billion and increased sequentially up well over $1 billion from where we started the fiscal year. When taken together with reported revenue total bookings for the company grew 14%. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment starting with clients. Client revenue of $4 billion was down 24% or down 2% adjusted for the tech guarantees. Adjusting that further for a retail launch bump from last year client revenue would have been up 4%. Let\u2019s break down the main drivers behind client revenue first for OEM license units and then for OEM revenue. During the quarter our OEM license units increased by 5%, about four points than the overall hardware market. We believe this reversal of the OEM unit trend outpacing that of the PC market was primarily driven by three factors. One, last year OEMs particularly in the system builder channel rebuilt inventory levels following the launch of Windows Vista driving OEM unit growth over 20% during that quarter and making it a tough comp. Two, inventory levels at our OEM partners this year were higher than normal exiting fiscal Q2 impacting this quarter\u2019s purchases. Three, we believe there was an increase in shipments of unlicensed PCs particularly in Asia. While we generally feel good about the gains we are making in piracy for the year, piracy is a tough battle in an area where we will need to continue investing in order to make progress. Looking past the individual quarters, PC market growth was up 12% to 14% year to date with OEM license units growing about a point faster which is in line with our historical rate of progress against piracy. OEM revenue declined 25% but grew a point when normalized for the tech guarantees in the prior year. The four percentage difference between OEM license unit growth and revenue growth was caused by two roughly equivalent factors; mainly the increasing volume in emerging markets and a channel shift to large OEMs from the system builder channel. Partially offsetting these impacts was in increase in premium mix. Premium mix grew five points during the quarter to 76% driven by an increase in the consumer element of the mix while the business portion was unchanged. The remaining roughly 20% of client revenue comes from the commercial and retail licensing portion of the business which declined 18% or was down 13% after adjusting for tech guarantees. Normalizing last year\u2019s Windows Vista launch bump at approximately $225 million growth would have been up 23%. We continue to see healthy growth in the commercial portion of the business as sales of software assurance were once again strong as evidenced by the 29% in the client volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. Since the launch of Windows Vista revenue for the client business has grown 16% with a license growth rate of one to two points above that of the PC hardware market. Over 140 million licenses of Windows Vista have been sold to date and Service Pack 1 was released in the quarter. Moving to server and tools, revenue of $3.3 billion represented an increase of 18% marking its 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Customers continue to gravitate towards premium versions of Windows Server and SQL Server as well as to annuity contracts. The increased billing mix of annuity contracts drove the unearned revenue balance for the division up by over 35% versus last year. Our consulting and support services revenue increased 24% as we\u2019ve experienced high demand following the recent launches across our product lines. The third quarter also marked the launch activities of the new versions of our flagship products in the server and tools division, namely Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008. These products bring powerful new tools to our customers and partners looking to turn their IT departments into a strategic asset. For example Windows Server 2008 with virtualization technology will help customers increase reliability and flexibility of their server infrastructure, reduce costs and increase security. Online services business grew revenue 40% to $843 million this included $143 million from the addition of aQuantive. Online advertising grew 39% or was up 29% excluding the $47 million of ad revenue from aQuantive. Our online audience continues to grow. Live IDs increased to 18% to 448 million while usage deepened with search queries and page views up from the prior year. In the quarter we announced a number of acquisitions including Caligari for collaborative 3D modeling, YaData for customer micro segment management, and Rapt for behavioral targeting. And of course in February we proposed to purchase Yahoo. Chris will go into more detail about Yahoo later in the call. Microsoft business division revenue was $4.7 billion down 2% but up 9% adjusted for tech guarantees in fiscal year 2008. Adjusted for last year\u2019s retail launch bump of about $150 million revenue would have grown 13% with business customer revenue growth of 17%. Our expanded portfolio of productivity products are thriving with share point revenue up over 35%, unified communications up over 20% and dynamic customer billings up 13%. On the strategic front we announced the acquisition of FAST Search and Transfer to enhance our enterprise search offerings. During the quarter we also held our SharePoint and Convergent conferences which both saw record attendance by customers and partners. And we expanded on our software plus services vision by announcing that the Beta of SharePoint online and exchange online will be opened to companies of all sizes. Entertainment and devices division grew revenue of 68% to $1.6 billion over $300 million above our high end guidance driven by the sale of 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles. High holiday demand for Xbox 360 consoles during the preceding quarter in which Xbox 360 outsold PlayStation 3 by over 1 million units in the US led to a short channel inventory for much of this quarter. However according to US MPG data by March Xbox 360 had reclaimed its monthly console sales lead over the PS3. With retail inventory restored to more healthy levels Xbox 360 is well positioned as the industry anticipates next week\u2019s launch of Grand Theft Auto 4. During the quarter we announced the acquisition of Danger which closed last week and announced the November target release date for Gears of War the highly anticipated sequel to the fastest selling video game of 2007. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased by $370 million primarily driven by higher Xbox 360 console sales, growth in our consulting business, and expansion of data center operations and the addition of aQuantive costs. After adjusting the year-ago quarter for the impact of tech guarantees cost of revenue held flat at 17% of sales. Operating expenses increased almost $1.9 billion or up 33% primarily due to $1.4 billion of legal charges relating to the European commission fine assessed in February. Adjusting for that charge in the current quarter and $150 million of legal charges in the same quarter of last year, operating expenses increased $600 million, up 11%. This is favorable to our expectations due to lower headcount driven costs and some shift of marketing expense into the fourth quarter. Operating income was $4.4 billion. After adjusting for the impact of tech guarantees and legal charges, operating income grew 15%, one point faster than revenue growth. Investment income and other totaled $401 million for the quarter as the treasury team continued to do an outstanding job in challenging capital markets. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%. During the quarter we settled a 2000 to 2003 examination with the IRS. As a result we reduced our previously accrued tax provision by $1.4 billion which was partially offset by the non-tax deductibility of the European commission fines resulting in our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter of 29%. During the quarter we repurchased 30 million shares or $1 billion of company stock and paid out over $1 billion in dividends to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.4 billion down 4% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.47 which was $0.02 to $0.04 above our guidance after adjusting for the offsetting impacts of the $0.15 EPS charge from the European commission fine and the $0.15 benefit from the resolution of the tax examination. So in summary our diversification across geographies, product lines, customer segments and product life cycles produced 14% top line and 27% bottom line growth. This allowed us to generate over $7 billion of operating cash flow, the second highest level in the history of Microsoft. With that let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our fourth quarter guidance and our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2009.\nChris Liddell: Thanks Colleen, I\u2019m going to spend my remaining time on the call giving you a view of our expectations for the fourth quarter followed by a preliminary view of fiscal 2009. I also note that we have about twice the number of people on the call as normal so for some of the newcomers I\u2019ll also make some brief comments on our proposed acquisition of Yahoo. Let me begin by outlining some of our key assumptions for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll assume the following macroeconomic conditions for the remainder of the year; we expect the software spending environment to remain mixed but positive overall on a global basis especially for the positioning of our products and the value they offer. Like you we are cautious on the reported economic softness in the US but at this point we have not seen any significant spillover to our businesses. We continue to benefit from strong underlying growth in non-US and emerging markets which has also been assisted by stronger international currencies. For the fourth quarter we expect PC hardware unit growth of 9% to 11%. Growth will continue to be driven by strength in emerging markets while we are tempering our forecast to growth rates in mature markets. [inaudible] fourth quarter guidance and year-over-year growth rates, we expect revenue of $15.5 billion to $15.8 billion representing excellent growth of 16% to 18% over fiscal 2007. Revenue guidance by business unit is as follows: for client we expect revenue growth of 7% to 11% for the fourth quarter. The guidance of [power] units, OEM units will grow in line slightly ahead of the PC hardware market and underlying PC market dynamics in the consumer and emerging market segments will drive OEM unit growth in excess of OEM revenue. Sever and tools revenue should 18% to 20% in fourth quarter. We expect corporate demand for our server products to remain strong which will drive double-digit growth across the [bricks] of our server platform products and services. In the online services business we forecast revenue to be up 37% to 41% for the fourth quarter. Microsoft business division revenue should grow 15% to 16% on continued demand for the 2007 Office Suites, SharePoint and Office communication server. Lastly entertainment and devices division revenue is expected to grow 32% to 34% driven by strong demand for Xbox 360 consoles and games. Turning back to company wide performance operating income for the fourth quarter is expect to be between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion representing 46% to 54% growth over the prior year which included the Xbox 360 warranty charges. Excluding those charges operating income should grow a very healthy 15% to 22%. Fully diluted earnings per share expected to come in at $0.45 to $0.48 for the fourth quarter and this guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 30%. So with that fourth quarter guidance we arrived at the following expectations for the full fiscal year 2008. Revenue of $60.1 billion to $60.3 billion representing year-over-year growth of 17% to 18%; operating income of $22.6 billion to $23 billion, excluding the European commission fine of $1.4 billion in the quarter, operating income would have been $24 billion to $24.4 billion; and for fully diluted earnings per share we expect $1.87 to $1.90 representing growth of 33% to 35% when normalized for legal charges and tax benefits. So with the close of the FAST Search and Transfer acquisition since the last time we provided you with guidance in January we\u2019ve updated our fiscal \u201908 guidance to include and estimate of about $50 million of in process R&D and integration costs related to the acquisition. From a balance sheet perspective we are maintaining our previous forecast of total unearned revenue balance to finish fiscal 2008 up 14% to 16% over prior years. Contract but not billed should also finish 2008 up from current levels. With that let\u2019s turn our current thinking about the next fiscal year. Remember this represents our preliminary view prior to completing our internal budgeting and planning process which occurs during the fiscal fourth quarter. This guidance does not include any impacts from our proposed acquisition of Yahoo. Our current forecast for fiscal 2009 revenue is $66.9 billion to $68.0 billion which represents growth of 11% to 13%. On an absolute basis that represents an increase of approximately $7 billion to $8 billion of incremental revenues. We expect operating income to be between $26.7 billion and $27.4 billion or growing 18% to 19%. Excluding the European commission fine in fiscal 2008 operating income is expected to grow roughly in line with revenue growth. Although [inaudible] about costs and operating expenses [inaudible] is still preliminary we expect operating income margins to remain generally flat year-on-year which includes the impact of about $0.50 billion of additional expenses related to recently announced acquisitions including FAST and Danger which were not in our forecast when we saw many of you in New York in February. We look forward to providing more detail on the fiscal \u201909 investments on our fourth quarter earnings call and our fiscal analyst meeting on July 24th. So for the rest of the income statement we expect investment income to be lower in fiscal \u201909 due to lower yields on the investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rate environment but we are also modeling a decline in our tax rate to 28% in fiscal 2009 driven by continued shift in our earnings mix towards lower tax rate jurisdictions. We expect fully diluted earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.19 representing growth of 14% to 15%. As always I\u2019ll remind you to think about the guidance that we provided. You must also consider the risks. These included competitors, legal, execution and general market risks such as foreign exchange for instance, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spendings, changes in the piracy rates of our products and customer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally changes in the mix of our sellings between the new [inaudible] and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. I\u2019d like to wrap up with a couple of final comments. First as you consider the performance we\u2019re delivering in fiscal 2008, and the preliminary view of fiscal \u201909, they are great examples of the growth model we\u2019ve had for the company which I outlined previously. It begins by focusing on the growth opportunities where we can differentiate ourselves through software and in particular business IT spending but also increasing the online advertising and consumer entertainment. Add to that a truly global approach to our sales, two-thirds of our revenue driven from users outside of the US and about 15% in high growth emerging markets. These opportunities set the stage for healthy broad based revenue growth across our businesses. That revenue growth allows us to reinvest into our existing business, pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities while continuing to grow operating profits. Operating profits combined with reductions in our share count and improvements in our tax rate drive earnings per share growth. If we achieve the guidance we have outlined today over the three year period through fiscal year \u201909 during one of the most difficult economic environments we have faced we will grow earnings per share approximately 80%. Lastly before handing the call back to Colleen, I wanted to provide a brief update on our proposal to acquire Yahoo. With or without a Yahoo combination Microsoft is focused on the online advertising market which is expected to double by 2010 to $80 billion. Although Yahoo would accelerate our efforts we have an existing strategy that is already centered on three key pillars; drive innovation and search, increase value to advertisers and publishers through innovation and scale and grow user engagement across our MSN and Windows Live properties. We have an extremely talented engineering team, a great portfolio of advertiser and publisher tools and key assets in information content, communications and social networking. Lastly we are committed to compete in online advertising through organic investments, partnerships and acquisitions such as aQuantive and Rapt. With respect to Yahoo we have been as evidenced in the size of our offer premium that speed is of the essence for the deal to make sense and get folded into our online strategy. Unfortunately the transaction has been anything but speedy as is being characterized by what would appear to be unrealistic expectations of value. Our initial offer was an extremely generous more than 100% premium fee [inaudible] core business. And our view on value is shaped by the long-term value of the company and we intend to remain disciplined in our approach. The strongest argument that I\u2019ve heard on why we should increase our bid, simply that we can afford to, is not one that I favor. We\u2019ve yet to see tangible evidence that our bid substantially undervalues the company. In fact we see the opposite. Yahoo continues to lose search share and profitability continues to decline year-on-year. The results that they announced on Tuesday were in line with the guidance that they gave on their last earnings call on January 29, after which their stock price closes at $19.05 and Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus on value was significantly decreased. As outlined in our recent letter to the Yahoo Board, unless we make progress with Yahoo towards an agreement by this weekend, we will reconsider our alternatives. We will provide updates as appropriate next week. These alternatives clearly include taking the offer to Yahoo shareholders or to withdraw our proposal and focus on other opportunities both organic and inorganic. With that being said I\u2019d like to remind you that we\u2019re here today to discuss our earnings and we hope you understand that we can\u2019t go beyond in the Q&A session what I\u2019ve just said. With that I\u2019ll hand the call back to Colleen so we can get started taking your questions.\nColleen Heally: Thank you Chris. Let\u2019s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible so please avoid multi part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from Charlie DiBona - Sanford Bernstein\nCharlie DiBona: I know it\u2019s early but I was wondering if we could maybe dive a little bit into your fiscal \u201909 guidance, in particular you\u2019re calling for something around 12% revenue growth here. With the US economy looking like its getting weaker, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve included any kind of recession in your forecasting but can you maybe characterize your view of your business and how insolated it would be from a US based downturn and how solid that number looks if the economy starts to get weaker?\nChris Liddell: The first thing to comment on is in line with some of the prepared remarks that we made. One of the great things about our business from my perspective is the diversification and the diversification across geographies and across business types. So clearly we like everyone else would be impacted by an economic downturn if one was to get worse than where it is, but we have built in what we consider to be an appropriate level of conservatism at this stage for next year. And I\u2019ll just remind you that two-thirds of our business is now out the US and some we\u2019ve seen some very strong growth from emerging markets. So a very good geographic spread and also fairly a weak US dollar helps us in that perspective. The other thing to mention is this year would be one year that most people would say has been one of relatively difficult economic conditions so this is a year where if we finish out along the guidance that we have talked about we will have grown revenue by 17% to 18% and earnings per share by 33% to 35% so if we can turn in a performance like that in what a lot of people are finding to be a particularly difficult year, then that gives me a lot of confidence in our business model going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs\nSarah Friar: Chris the FY09 EPS guidance is quite robust so could you give us a sense for what does that assume in terms of the investment required for your goals in the online services business and if for whatever reason you don\u2019t get Yahoo do you have to come back and revise down the margin for a build versus a buy decision?\nChris Liddell: There\u2019s a reasonable amount of additional growth in our expense line for the online and is already imbedded into fiscal year \u201909 so we\u2019ll obviously give you more detail in three months because we haven\u2019t completed our internal budgeting but if you look at the makeup of the expense growth then it\u2019s around 20% to 25% of that growth will be to drive our online services division with those final numbers to be determined in the next three months. The balance will go into other high growth areas in the other divisions into things like building our sales force and in particular outside of the US and then we\u2019re getting other impacts like FX and so forth coming in as well. But there is already a reasonably high proportion of expense growth allocated to the online services area and also in terms of CapEx we\u2019re expecting to spend more next year and that\u2019s imbedded in our numbers as well than this year. So clearly if Yahoo was to happen we\u2019d have to overlay that impact. We would still think about spending I would think virtually all of that money in terms of organic growth anyway. If Yahoo wasn\u2019t to happen, could we consider other investments, yes but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\nSarah Friar: Great, the currency impact on the quarter, could you just give us a sense for that?\nChris Liddell: Yes, around 3% benefit both on the revenue and the expense side so if you like in the expense it\u2019s a negative but a 3% impact broadly speaking in both revenue and expenses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS\nHeather Bellini: I know piracy is a difficult thing to solve for each quarter but I know your comps here are getting tough in the second half of calendar year \u201908, so how should we think about your progress \u2013 the progress you made in the second half of \u201907 how much of a tough comp does that give you for the client business than in the second half of \u201908 and then just about the buybacks, I believe I read in your Q you cut them to about a billion dollars this quarter, should we expect that level to stay until we know the outcome of the Yahoo transaction?\nChris Liddell: Starting with piracy, you\u2019re right on a quarter-by-quarter basis and I\u2019ll talk to you and other investors about this its difficult to look at piracy on a quarter-by-quarter because we can see individual enforcement actions make a big difference in any one quarter so we had a very good performance in the first two quarters of the year. The first and second quarter of our fiscal year a relatively weak performance, in fact it was a negative in this quarter so overall for the year, we still think that we will drive unit growth 1% to 2% higher than underlying market growth as a result of our combating piracy but relative to the first couple of quarters when we had very good performance that\u2019s a little lower. So we still think it\u2019s a positive trend overall but you are correct it does get progressively harder. In this particular quarter we had a couple of distributors had a particularly high distribution of unlicensed PCs in China due to some market conditions there. You can have that sort of one-off impact so it\u2019s much better to look at it on a year by year rather than a quarter by quarter.\nHeather Bellini: Just to understand that topic just because that means that in the September and December quarter of calendar year \u201908 you\u2019ve got pretty tough comps, is that the situation where we should expect your OEM to be below PC shipments for your revenue to grow less than PC shipment?\nChris Liddell: Are you talking about for the fourth quarter?\nHeather Bellini: No I\u2019m talking about for September and December given the tough comps you have September and December of \u201908, you\u2019ve got tough comps in piracy versus September and December of \u201907.\nChris Liddell: Yes I think for next year but I just don\u2019t want to get into too much guidance. We still think that we will grow units more than PC demand but for the same, you\u2019ll get the same impact that you\u2019ve seen for this year which is the extent that it grows faster in emerging than mature markets et cetera then revenue will be slightly lower than unit growth and that will probably wash out to mean that revenue will be broadly in line or just slightly below overall market growth but we still think that our unit growth will be higher than market growth.\nHeather Bellini: Okay and then just the buyback question.\nChris Liddell: On the buyback, yes you are correct it was low this quarter in particular because of the Yahoo transaction. I want to maintain the most amount of flexibility for that transaction in terms of our cash buildup and how the final transaction might work if it does. Therefore I don\u2019t intend to get into quarter by quarter and I don\u2019t want to give specifics but also just from a legal perspective, its difficult for us to be too active in the buyback market so I would expect us to be relative modest from a buyback perspective until we get clarity on Yahoo one way or the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch\nKash Rangan: If you just look at the guidance philosophically Chris compared to the last couple of years the same time of the year when we you were giving guidance for the upcoming year I think guidance has been generally below consensus or bracketing consensus \u2013 mainly conservative giving you the opportunity to outperform as you execute on your model. I\u2019m just curious this time around I think the guidance tests certainly as Charlie indicated assumes some US \u2013 actually a reasonable level of execution on the revenue side range of 12% growth but I\u2019m wondering on the earnings side if you\u2019re not giving enough flexibility for potential spending in the online business if the Yahoo transaction were not to come through just philosophically I guess my question is how do you think about guidance relative to the trend \u2013 it seems like there\u2019s a bit of a change here and I\u2019m just curious what your thought process there is.\nChris Liddell: There\u2019s a few trends here, from a revenue point of view, as I mentioned to Charlie I feel very good about our revenue forecast 11% to 13% for next year. I think that\u2019s very good in the current economic environment and as I said I think that is a testament to the strength of our particular investment business model and also the fact that we have made a lot of investments in the past. We have talked to investors about the benefits of those investments and I think that is starting to pay. Clearly in this year where we\u2019ve driven revenue by over 16% and next year 11% to 13% feels very good. So I feel good on the revenue side. On the operating expense side I think we\u2019re making at this stage plenty of provisions for what I consider to be appropriate OpEx not just in the online services but across the whole business. So I don\u2019t feel bad that we are leaving anything out there. Clearly if we were to make another acquisition or to acquire Yahoo that does change the game but in terms of allowing us to do what we want to do organically and through some level of acquisition not only in online services but in other businesses I feel good about the level that we have built in at this stage. And overall earnings per share growing 14% to 15% I guess some assumptions there about buybacks and investment income, I mentioned the tax rate is starting to come down and I talked about this at the last couple of financial analyst meeting that we are now in a period where you can expect to see our tax rate start to go down year after year not only in fiscal year \u201909 but in fiscal year \u201910 as well as a result of the changes in our business models. So if you look at the individual parts of guidance for fiscal year \u201909 at this stage I feel we are hanging together very well.\nKash Rangan: and also the bookings growth rate, coming in at 14% do you think that is more indicative of what we should expect over the few quarters because I think and right after the product launches you had 30% and then it looks like we\u2019ve seen some deceleration but is this the real run rate going forward given that we\u2019re entering a more mature aspect of the product cycle?\nChris Liddell: You would expect over the long-term that bookings growth and overall revenue growth to be broadly both the same as each other so if we can continue to get bookings growth excluding Vista unearned impact but general bookings growth in the mid teens that would support low to mid teens revenue growth. If that\u2019s the mature part of the cycle then that\u2019s pretty healthy from my perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Difucci - Bear Stearns\nJohn Difucci: I have a follow-up to Heather\u2019s question and it has to do with the anti piracy efforts. The September to December quarters we saw some big benefits from that and actually seemed to take us by surprise and you by surprise and this quarter that looks to have reversed. Chris you mentioned I guess government crackdowns and we had heard some of those in the second half of last year, is there any other color you can give us on that because trying to understand this and obviously its going to be a fight as you move along but if its always going to be you get a foot and you give up a yard kind of thing, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what you see and in Asia this quarter why would it sort of reverse and then secondly on that I\u2019m just curious why you expect an acceleration in PC growth into the next quarter especially given the macroeconomic backdrop.\nChris Liddell: On piracy or more particularly on license shipments which become pirated, you are true that on a quarter by quarter basis it can move around quite a lot and hopefully you recall in particular in the first quarter that I said don\u2019t take too much from this positive number. You can get an aberration like this on a quarterly basis and you could have a negative one by implication and that\u2019s what we have seen this quarter. So again I\u2019ll just reinforce you really need to look at things like piracy on a long-term basis and average them out to really get a sense of how it\u2019s happening. In the first quarter in particular we saw a very strong performance in our Russian subsidiary which helped enormously when you spread that volume over the total business. In this quarter in China because of some specific market dynamics that happened in that country you saw a relatively negative performance. You have got to wash those things out. You have got to look at it on the course of the year. We still think for the year we are going to have PC unit growth of 11% to 13%. We think we are going to ship our units of 12% to 14%. So we still think we are going to pick up one maybe two percent of shipment growth relative to overall market growth and that washes out the unders and overs and that\u2019s how I prefer to think of it.\nColleen Heally: And just to put that into a little more context too on the unlicensed PCs aspect, just keep in mind that when we were looking at the PC units to OEM units that was one of three factors that we talked you through in bridging that, so that is one of three factors.\nChris Liddell: In terms of overall PC demand what I would say is we started the year believing that we were going to have about 9% to 11% in terms of unit shipments. The third quarter came in at 8% to 10%. So broadly speaking it was in line with where we started the year. It was a little bit weaker in mature markets which I think picks up some of the economic issues that we are seeing particularly in the US but it was stronger in emerging markets. So the mix was different to what we thought but the overall market was about in line, 1% lower which is [around the area] really to where we started the year. What we saw really was a particularly strong performance in Q1 and Q2 so it\u2019s difficult to continue to extrapolate an out performance, 8 to 10 I don\u2019t feel bad about. And if we can end the year at 11 to 13 which is how we feel relative to a starting point of 9 to 11 we still feel that\u2019s a good robust year but obviously on a quarter by quarter basis again you can read too much into an individual quarter if you look at the year it looks pretty good.\nJohn Difucci: Yes but how could you I mean given the macro backdrop it just seems kind of odd that you would assume that PC sales would increase in this current quarter versus the 8 to 10.\nChris Liddell: Well we\u2019re talking about 9 to 11 for the fourth quarter relative to 8 to 10 for the third quarter. So it\u2019s a 1% change. And don\u2019t forget the third quarter, this quarter [lept] Vista launch last year so you\u2019ve got some aberrations on a year on year basis but accelerating from 8 to 10 to a 9 to 11 third quarter to fourth quarter doesn\u2019t feel like its \u2013 we haven\u2019t got the foot on the accelerator very hard to achieve that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Breza - UBS Capital Markets\nRobert Breza: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the integration of aQuantive and I guess where does that sit relative to your estimates and how is that tracking to your plan?\nChris Liddell: There's a number of ways of looking at how it\u2019s integrated. The first and most important is from an employee integration point of view given that the real revenue potential is some years out. From the employee point of view we couldn\u2019t have been happier. All of the key executives have remained. Brian [Makendries] is doing a great job leading that and is taking a broader role inside Microsoft in terms of driving that part of the strategy. We\u2019ve integrated in my view the cultures very well and we\u2019ve got people from aQuantive taking a broader role and Microsoft people from the previous Microsoft working inside and helping drive aQuantive strategy and they\u2019re very active and thinking the way in which they can not only build aQuantive as it was but use the financial and other resources of Microsoft to make aQuantive go faster. So if you take that as the sort of first determinate of how well things have gone, I\u2019m extremely happy with that. In terms of the underlying business, leading indicator would be just number of publishers we\u2019re getting on board again that\u2019s going very healthy. We\u2019ve talked through the quarter I think we\u2019ve made a few announcements. There are 96 I believe new publishers of various sizes have switched on to the Atlas Publisher Suite in the last quarter, since we announced sorry. So very good growth in the underlying dynamic in the business. From a profitability point of view, we\u2019re carrying the costs of the acquisition but we are managing to achieve the results that we talked about despite the fact that at this stage its early days for aQuantive and we\u2019re carrying in particular some of the non-cash charges associated with the acquisition. So the revenue growth is still ahead of us, from a cost point of view we\u2019re in line but it\u2019s a negative. From a publisher business point of view good early indicators and from a people point of view it\u2019s excellent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne - Banc of America Securities\nKirk Materne: Operating margins for the fourth quarter appear to be going down just a tad versus the third fiscal quarter, could you just explain some of the dynamics around that. I realize you have just made some acquisitions. Is it mainly headcount related? Is there some mix shift going on between the businesses? Anything to do with E&D, obviously its going to have a strong quarter with Grand Theft Auto, I\u2019m just trying to get the dynamics about that.\nChris Liddell: The problem looking at margins for the business overall is you inevitably get quite a lot of difference between the individual businesses and how they make up one quarter. So that\u2019s the first statement and its best to look at the year overall where you\u2019re looking at margin expansion but if you look at the trends through the quarters. I think quarter one was 43%, quarter two was 39.6, quarter three was 40.3, and quarter four was 37.6, overall 40. So in any one quarter you can get quite different movements and that reflects (a) the mix of businesses and (b) if you have a strong Xbox quarter you get a lot of the [cogs] associated with that that tends to decrease the margins. Fourth quarter we get a lot of marketing and signup costs associated with our enterprise businesses which generally are buying annuities. So we don\u2019t get a lot of the revenue associated with it, we get some of the costs and we get the benefits of that revenue flying through for the next year. So the short answer to your question is there is nothing unusual in the fourth quarter. We typically see it if you look back in previous years it\u2019s a low margin quarter relative to the first, second and third. There\u2019s nothing unusual about this fourth quarter. Its part of the normal cycle.\nKirk Materne: If I could just follow-up on John\u2019s question just on the acceleration in PCs into the fourth quarter, one of the comments you had about the last quarter was just the inventory levels being a little bit higher heading into the third quarter, I assume those have been drawn down to levels you feel more comfortable with heading into the fourth quarter?\nChris Liddell: Yes, although just to be clear I think John\u2019s question was PC units overall and inventory levels tend to be a comment about our shipments to OEM so those are very tightly related to each other clearly but in answer to your question, yes they are [inaudible] more normal. Although I will say it\u2019s quite early in the quarter. Sometimes we get that information over the next few weeks but there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s unusual going into this quarter and that\u2019s embedded in our guidance.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Brent Thill - Citigroup\nBrent Thill: Chris just drilling into the client line item, that was clearly probably the biggest disappointment relative to all of our models and understanding the licensing change but when you drill into what\u2019s happening with Vista and XP are you still happy with what you\u2019re seeing in the Vista upgrade cycle or are you still seeming more units of XP going than you like and that wouldn\u2019t obviously have an impact on the pricing?\nChris Liddell: Yes, with respect to the quarter, the third quarter in particular there\u2019s really no Vista-related issues at all. In terms of the impacts, firstly the overall PC market, unlicensed PCs which is not a Vista issue. Emerging markets growing faster than mature markets, that\u2019s not really a Vista issue. A bit of a channel shift to larger OEMs again not a Vista issue. And obviously if we sell a unit of XP rather than selling a unit of Vista we\u2019re still relatively happy because of the realization and so there\u2019s nothing in the third quarter that is specific to Vista in terms of the walkthrough from the overall PC market down to overall client revenue. I guess the only Vista impact really is the launch last year and the very strong comparables that we have but that\u2019s not really a comment about this quarter its more a comment on the year-ago quarter and the comparable.\nColleen Heally: Yes I think if you look at whether it\u2019s Vista, [inaudible] or from a mix standpoint we can let you know we\u2019re up a bit sequentially in terms of Vista -- shared with you 140 million licenses sold so you know I think things are tracking well and as expected from our perspective.\nChris Liddell: So with that I\u2019ll thank you all, I\u2019ll hand it back to Colleen to finish but I look forward to talking to a number of you in three months and in particular seeing a number of you at the financial analyst meeting a few days later.\nColleen Heally: Thanks everyone for your participation in today\u2019s call.

I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call by providing you with the highlights from our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2008.  Results for the quarter were outstanding.  Revenues surpassed our previous record high by $2 billion and at $16.4 billion that exceeded the high end of our expectations by over $300 million. We are benefitting from the investments we\u2019ve made over recent years plus excellent execution performance from our field sales force.  Revenue in the quarter grew 30% or 15% adjusted for the technology guarantees in the comparable period last year.  Besides just the sheer size and pace of growth, the breadth was notable as we saw strength across all customer segments, divisions, channels and geographies. For example, demand from enterprise customers combined with healthy holiday consumer spending for Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system drove revenue for the business group a combined 18% for the quarter.  Server and tools, once again delivered double digit revenue growth in the quarter, the 22nd in a row.  Healthy enterprise agreements signings across the company drove our unearned revenue balance up over $0.5 billion, $500 million above our guidance. The successful integration of our eQuantive acquisition plus good organic growth helped our online business grow 38% and a compelling lineup of Xbox games drove our performance for our entertainment and devices division.  E&D had its second consecutive quarter in the black, on its way to our target of full year profitability. From a geographic perspective, over 60% of our sales are from users in regions outside of the US.  Revenue in those regions continue to drive growth for the company with non-US mature markets up over 20% for the first half of the year and emerging markets up nearly 30%. During the quarter we combined revenue growth with cost efficiencies resulting in operating income growth of 27%, even adjusted for the tech guarantees of last year.  Operating margins during the quarter were a healthy 40%.  Lastly, earnings per share growth of 32% after adjusting for last year\u2019s tech guarantee continued to benefit from the accommodation of strong operating performance and execution of our share repurchase program. So overall the quarter and half one performance demonstrates that we\u2019re realizing the benefits from our expanding business lines, product SKUs and global presence.  The investments we\u2019ve made, including in our sales force and new product offerings have positioned us well to offer the right product in the right markets worldwide.  And during the quarter we refreshed and bolstered our product line up with releases of Microsoft Dynamic CRM, Visual Studio 2008, new Zune devices and progress towards the upcoming server offerings, including release candidate one of Windows Server 2008 and a beta of our server virtualization technology, Hyper-V. In light of the strong second quarter, we are increasing our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year.  We now expect revenue growth of 17-18% and operating income growth of 31-32% and finally we\u2019re raising our earnings per share forecast by $0.07 for the year to $1.85-$1.88, a growth of 30-32%.  With those high level themes, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Colleen for more details on our second quarter performance.\nColleen Healy: Thanks Chris.  The strong momentum that kicked off our fiscal year continued in our second quarter.  As Chris mentioned, revenue exceeded the high end of our expectations by $300 million during the quarter.  This was driven by demand for our flagship product of Windows Vista and Office 2007 as well as a good holiday season for our Xbox franchise.  This revenue outperformance combined with decreasing Xbox 360 console costs flowed through to operating income and earnings per share. Let me provide you with details of our financial performance starting with revenue.  I\u2019ll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units.  Then I\u2019ll review the rest of the income statement.  All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. Revenue is $16.4 billion, an increase of 30%.  Adjusting the year ago quarter by the $1.6 billion of revenue deferrals primarily related to the technology guarantee program for Windows and Office, total revenue grew 15%.  With business and consumer PCs each experiencing double digit growth rates, the underlying PC hardware market increased an estimated 14-16% during the quarter, about 3 points higher than our expectations.  PC growth rates in emerging markets continue to outpace that of mature markets.  Europe led the mature markets and we again saw significant improvement in the US and especially in Japan. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately 30% from OEMs, 30% from multi-year agreements, 20% from license only sales and the balance from our other businesses.  Annuities sales were robust, particularly for server and tools in anticipation of the major product releases scheduled for the second half.  This combined with enterprise agreement renewal rates, consistent with historical trends, drove our unearned revenue balance over $0.5 billion above our guidance to $12.2 billion, up 20% year over year normalizing for the impact of the tech guarantee deferrals. Our contracted not billed balance increased sequentially to over $11.5 billion, up well over $1 billion from where we started the fiscal year.  When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company were almost 20%. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment, starting with clients.  A robust personal computer market and progress against software piracy drove client revenues to $4.3 billion, up 68%, or 16% after adjusting for tech guarantees.  Over 80% of client revenue comes from our OEM business.  During the quarter, we grew our OEM unit shipments at 18%, approximately 3 percentage points faster than the overall hardware market.  Curbing software piracy has been a significant investment area for the company over the last several years and those investments are paying off. OEM revenue grew 80% or 18% when normalized for the tech guarantee and in line with our OEM unit growth rate.  In terms of premium mix, three out of every four Windows customers adopted premium versions during the quarter.  Consumer premium units grew over 50% while business premium units grew 12%.  As a result, the OEM premium mix increased by 8 points to 75%, driven by an 11 point increase in the consumer element of the mix and offset by a 3 point decline in the business  portion due to the pricing differences between business premium and consumer premium SKUs, these changes in the premium have largely offsetting impacts to revenue. The commercial and retail licensing portion of the business increased 18%, up 8% adjusted for tech guarantees as business customers continue to add client products to their annuity agreements.  Next week will mark the one year anniversary of the general availability of Windows Vista.  We feel extremely good about the performance it has driven this first year.  Specifically, client revenue is growing on average over 40%, up over 20% adjusted for tech guarantees.  Client volume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance has increased 29% year over year.  And sales of Windows Vista have surpassed 100 million licenses. Server and tools revenue increased 15% to $3.3 billion, driven by double digit revenue growth in each of the Windows Server and SQL Server businesses.  Coupled with the significant shift in our billings to annuity licensing in advance of the upcoming product releases, this resulted in the server and tools portion of the unearned revenue balance increasing by over $1 billion, up by over 35% year over year. License growth for Windows Server and SQL Server grew at healthy double digit rates in the quarter.  Our premium SKU Windows Server Enterprise Edition with its virtualization capabilities grew 35%.  Our consulting revenue increased 28% as we\u2019ve experienced higher demand following the recent business product launches across the company. Online services business revenue grew 38% to $863 million, including $154 million from the addition of aQuantis.  Online advertising growth for the quarter was also 38%, up 26% excluding aQuantis.  Our online audience continues to grow.  Windows Live usage broadened as Live IDs increased over 20% to $427 million and the Windows Live Suite was downloaded 45 million times since its launch in November. We also continue to expand our advertising and content partnerships.  During the quarter, we became the exclusive third-party advertising partner on a worldwide basis for Facebook and we announced strategic alliances with Viacom and CNBC.  Since we announced our acquisition of aQuantis, 60 new publishers have switched to the atlas publishers suite offering. Microsoft business division revenue was $4.8 billion, up 37% or 20% normalized for tech guarantees.  Returns on our investment in field sales specialists were evident as they contributed to double digit revenue growth across a broad range of productivity offerings.  Revenue from business customers was up 23% in the quarter on continued broad based demand for not only versions of Office 2007 but also for Sharepoint Exchange, Office Communications Server and the Dynamic product. Sharepoint and Office Communications Server had a great quarter with each experiencing growth in excess of 50% and Dynamic\u2019s customer billings were up 26%.  Consumer revenue grew 10% adjusted for tech guarantees. Entertainment and Devices revenue grew 3% to $3.1 billion, over $90 million above our high end guidance, driven by an abundance of high demand game titles which contributed to setting a record lifetime to date software attach rate of 7.0.  In addition to normalized for the impact, in order to normalize for the impact of retailers advancing some of their holiday console purchases into Q1, spurred by the September launch of Halo 3, performance of the two quarters should be assessed together.  With that in mind, entertainment and devices revenue grew 25% in the first half of the fiscal year. Exiting the calendar year, life to date sales of Xbox 360 consoles hit 17.7 million units.  Based on US and PD data released last week, Xbox 360 sold over 1 million more consoles than PS3 in the holiday quarter.  From a shared wallet perspective, consumers spent 27% more on Xbox 360 consoles, games and accessories than on the Wii and twice as much than on the PS3.  Xbox 360 had four titles that sold over 1 million copies in the quarter, compared to three for the Wii and none for PS3.  Xbox Live rapidly achieved its 10 million members goal six months ahead of schedule. On the music scene, we are pleased by the favorable editorial reviews received by the second generation of Zune.  1.5 million people joined the Zune social online community during the holiday season and music downloads from our marketplace approximately doubled from last year. Now for the rest of the income statement.  Cost of revenue decreased by $75 million, primarily driven by more Xbox 360 component costs that were partially offset by growth in our consulting business, expansion of data center operations and the addition of aQuanits cost.  After adjusting prior year second quarter for the impact of tech guarantees, cost of revenue decreased by 4 points to 22% of sales. Operating expenses increased 16%, expense growth was slightly higher than head count growth due to legal charges taken in the quarter.  Operating income grew at a faster rate than revenue to $6.5 billion, adjusting for the prior year for the tech guarantee, cost of revenue improvement drove margin expansion, increasing our operating margin by 4 points to 40%. Investment income and other totaled $339 million for the quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, half a point higher than what we previously guided.  Cash flow from operations increased 124% to $4.6 billion.  During the quarter we repurchased 120 million shares or $4.1 billion of company stock and paid out over $1 billion in dividends to shareholders.  Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.5 billion, down 4% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases, but flat sequentially primarily due to stock options exercise in the quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50 which was $0.04 above our high end guidance, driven by the revenue outperformance.  So in summary we are extremely pleased with this quarter\u2019s revenue performance.  When combined with decreasing cost of revenue, operating income and EPS growth were also impressive.  With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our third quarter guidance and outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2008.\nChris Liddell: Thanks Colleen.  So let turn to the details of our forecast for the third quarter and the full year, beginning with some of the key underlying assumptions.  For our fiscal 2008 forecast we\u2019ll assume the following macroeconomic conditions for the remainder of the year.  As I mentioned before, over 60% of our business originates from countries outside of the US and we expect the overall software spending environment to remain healthy on a global basis. In US markets, although clearly the risk of an economic slowdown exists, we have not seen any significant spillover to our businesses and lastly we continue to benefit from strong underlying growth in non-US and emerging markets which has also been assisted by stronger international currencies. No company is immune from macroeconomic factors but overall we believe our business is extremely well positioned in the technology industry with diversification across a broad set of products, channels, geographies, currencies and customer segments, supported by excellent product value and sales execution. For PC hardware units, we expect growth of 11-13% for the fiscal year, an increase of one percentage point from our prior outlook, reflecting the upside we saw in the quarter.  Third quarter growth is forecasted to be 9-11%, slightly lower than the year because of the difficult prior year comparables from the launch of Windows Vista.  We expect PC hardware shipment units to decline sequentially from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year, in line with historic seasonality. Growth will continue to be driven by strength in emerging markets and we expect growth rates in the consumer segment to outpace that in the business segment.  In terms of our detailed guidance, we expect fiscal year revenue to be in the range of $59.9-$60.5 billion, growing 17-18%, which is an increase of over $700 million from our prior forecast, based on the strong exit from Q2.  We expect revenue in the third quarter of $14.3-$14.6 billion, up 12-15%, excluding the impact of the technology guarantee deferrals in the prior year. And with that I\u2019ll provide details of this guidance by segment.  Starting with client, we expect full year growth to be 13-14% with OEM revenue growing roughly in line with the PC market.  The third quarter, growth should be 3-5%, excluding the impact for tech guarantees.  When thinking about the third quarter revenue growth for client, keep in mind that the strong customer sections for launch of Windows Vista in the year ago period makes it a difficult comparable. Server tools revenue should grow 17-18% for the full year and 17-19% for the third quarter.  We expect continued corporate demand for our server products which will drive double digit growth across the breadth of our server platform, products and services.  We\u2019re forecasting the billings mix of server and tools to continue to shift towards annuity agreements ahead of the upcoming releases. Next month marks and important milestone to the group with the commencement of the joint launch activities for Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008.  Together these products will allow IT departments to be more productive by providing them with a secure, trusted and manageable platforms and which will underpin growth in the server and tools business over the next several years. With the online services business, we forecast revenue to grow between 37-40% for the year and to be up 40-45% in the third quarter.  Online advertising is expected to grow approximately 35% for both the quarter and the full year. Microsoft business division continues to be truly outstanding financial performance.  We\u2019ve raised our full year revenue guidance to 16-17% for the year and 11-12% for the third quarter, we\u2019re normalizing for last year\u2019s tech guarantee.  Growth in the second half of the year will be largely driven by the same factors that made the first half a success.  We expect to see continued demand for the 2007 Office Suite and Sharepoint and Office Communication Server should continue to grow double digits.  When thinking about growth in the second half of the year for the business division, bear in mind the growth of retail demand for the Office 2007 last year created the tough comparable. Our [unintelligible] does not include the any impact on the recently announced acquisition of FAST which we anticipate to close during our fourth quarter of the fiscal year and is not expected to have a material impact on earnings per share during this fiscal year. For the entertainment and devices division, expect revenue growth of 21-24% for the full year and 25-30% for the third quarter.  We\u2019ve raised the full year second half revenue forecast to reflect the record software attach rates and strength in Xbox console sales we experienced in the first half of the year. Turning back to companywide performance, operating income for the year is expected to be between $24.2-$24.4 billion, up 31-32% for the year, an increase of 3-4 points from our outlook in October.  Our higher revenue forecast is responsible for the increase in operating income as we expect greater than 75% of the incremental revenue to flow through to operating profit.  For the third quarter, we expect operating income to be between $5.6-$5.7 billion. As a result of the higher operating income guidance, we\u2019re increasing our full year earnings per share results to be $1.85-$1.88, an increase of $0.07 from our previous guidance.  For the third quarter we expect earnings per share of $0.43-$0.45.  This guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 30.5% for the full year. From balance sheet perspective, total unearned revenue should finish fiscal 2008, up 14-16%, 6 points or about $750 million above our October guidance, driven by strong annuity billings in our core businesses of client MBD and server and tools as well as an increase in an annuity licensing mix.  Excluding deferred revenue for undelivered elements, the remaining portion of the unearned revenue should increase 20-23%. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenue from Q2 to Q3, we expect the balance to follow historical patterns and remain roughly flat.  Contracted not billed should also finish 2008 up from current levels. As always, I\u2019ll remind you to think about guidance we\u2019re providing, you must also consider risks.  These risks include competitors, legal, execution and general market risks, such as foreign exchange rate movements, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growth rates, IT spending and customer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billings between annuity and license only can have an impact on revenues, operating income and earnings per share by delaying revenue recognition into future periods. Before moving on to questions, let me mention a few things.  Firstly I\u2019d like to welcome Stephen Elop to Microsoft.  Stephen has a wealth of experience from both an operational and leadership perspective and he will add a new dimension to our leadership team.  However I will also personally will miss working with Jeff Raikes who will retire from the company in September.  He\u2019s done a fantastic job over the years and leaves us not only with a strong Office franchise, but he has redefined the role of business productivity software at Microsoft by expanding the business into new areas of productivity offerings to collaboration, unified communications, business intelligence, DRP and CRM, resulting in a near doubling of MBD annual revenues since the year 2000.  It\u2019s notable that MBD is now the largest division of Microsoft in size of revenue. Lastly I will look forward to seeing a number of you a week from Monday in New York where Steve Ballmer and I will provide you an update on the strategic direction of the company.  For those of you who are unable to join us for this, we\u2019ll make available a live webcast as well as on demand replay of the presentation.  So with those comments I\u2019ll hand the call back Colleen so we can get started taking your questions.\nColleen Healy: Great, thanks Chris.  Let\u2019s now proceed to questions.  We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible so please avoid multiple part questions and limit yourself to just one question.  Operator, will you repeat your instructions please?\nOperator: Thank you.  We will now begin the question and answer session.  If you would like to ask a question, please press star one.  If you need to withdraw your request, press star two.  Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Hi, thank you.  Excuse my voice, good afternoon everybody.  Chris, I was wondering, you\u2019ve shown a lot of impressive top line performance over the last few quarters and in particular some nice upside in operating income.  I guess my question is after the past few years when we\u2019ve seen operating margins contract, do you feel now you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019ve made some of the big catch up investments you discussed in April of \u201906 and now looking forward the spending will be more incremental in nature and then I just have a follow up for that when you\u2019re done.\nChris Liddell: Sure, as I\u2019ve said in previous calls and certainly at financial analyst meeting, I think you have to look at the company in three parts.  The core businesses, the entertainment and devices business and the online business because the dynamics from a margin perspective are quite different in each of those and obviously the company is an amalgam of the three. In the core businesses, if you put them together collectively, certainly the operating margin has remained an impressively constant, in fact slightly up over the last few years and so we see revenue growth sort of broadly in line with operating income growth, operating [unintelligible] in those. The entertainment and devices division has moved from a loss to a profit so clearly the margins have improved there.  On the online business, it has been and will continue certainly for the foreseeable future to be in investment mode so that has a different dynamic altogether.  When you put those three together then the operating margin for the company will be very good this year and you can see that in our guidance for the year.  So overall we\u2019re not making any predictions including on the call at the moment about past the next couple of quarters but the operating margin performance as an average of those three trends is good for this year.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, that was my follow up is really you\u2019ve been in operating margin contraction mode for the past few years, you finally seem to be kicking it into high gear there where you\u2019re going to have well over 100 basis points, so should we expect Steve, when he\u2019s in town in two weeks to kind of discuss an operating plan for the company going forward where we might hear more about the increased leverage in the business?\nChris Liddell: I want to qualify the purpose of the February call, we\u2019ve always seen that as a good chance to talk about the strategic direction of the company.  So you can certainly expect to hear the investment themes, but as you know we\u2019re a quarter ahead of most companies in terms of giving out fiscal year guidance by doing it in April, and what I don\u2019t want to do is raise expectations that suddenly we\u2019re going to start doing that in February and then maybe we\u2019ll start doing it in November and we\u2019ll do it a year ahead of time.  It is a time to talk about the strategy of the company and the strategic themes and at a very high level that will give some indication of our thoughts about where we will invest, but it\u2019s not going to be a financial guidance exercise.\nHeather Bellini: Okay great, thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks Heather, we hope you\u2019re feeling better than your voice sounds.  Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Good afternoon guys, good quarter.  So following on that ending comment there Chris about areas where you\u2019ll invest, if you look at the online services business, it\u2019s still relatively small, the growth kind of ex-aQuantive is still not quite at the levels you might see from competitors.  How are you thinking about strategically where you need to go with that business and what are some of the big milestones we should be looking for over the next couple of quarters, maybe over the next year?\nChris Liddell: Well we certainly see it as a multi-year journey that we\u2019re going on and so we\u2019re investing with an expectation of hoping to be at a critical mass in several years.  I\u2019m happy if you look at the quarter [unintelligible] if you like the incremental progress we\u2019ve made, revenue growth of 38%, ex-aQuantive in the mid 20\u2019s, it certainly very respectable.  You are right in the sense it\u2019s not at the size of critical mass we\u2019d like to see and we are building a business we believe and hope will be at critical mass in the next few years. But I come back to the theme that we have talked about on several quarters and certainly at financial analyst meetings, we make decisions on investments now which have multi-year implications and when you look at the revenue performance over the last couple of quarters, that didn\u2019t happen by accident.  That happened as a result of investments that we made several years ago so you have to look back two or three years to look at the leading indicators of how we\u2019ve been able to drive revenue growth at extremely good levels and higher than most people\u2019s expectations than the last couple of quarters. So when you look forward in the online business, you have to think about the revenue, several years out and the infrastructure we are building for that.  Unfortunately from a financial perspective, that means investment now, but that\u2019s the way that we think about the company and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll continue to run it.\nSarah Friar: And just a follow up on that.  So that has been an area where you\u2019ve definitely been willing to look for inorganic growth, successfully with aQuantive and so on.  Is that also part of the ongoing strategy there, could we expect to see some more acquisitions go on for OSB that are of size?\nChris Liddell: We obviously don\u2019t speculate on acquisitions in any particular area.  We\u2019ve been willing to drive inorganic growth really across all of the divisions.  It probably gets a little more attention than the online business because of its nature, but in fact when you look at the acquisitions we\u2019ve made, they\u2019re across a broad spread, server and tools, the FAST acquisition that we made in the enterprise search area, some of the ones we\u2019ve made in the entertainment and devices division.  So, we have been willing to use our balance sheet to drive inorganic growth right across the company. I don\u2019t expect that to not continue, I think that trend will continue and again we\u2019ve signaled, I think Steve and I, our willingness to do acquisitions over the last couple of years.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll necessarily see some dramatic increase in the number that we do, they\u2019ve been going along at about a couple of months for the last couple of years and where we see opportunities where the situation is right, we\u2019ll look to use acquisitions.\nSarah Friar: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie Di Bona: Hi, Chris, for the last two quarters you\u2019ve called out anti-piracy as a driver in the client business.  Could you maybe give a little more color on the sort of specific impact that that\u2019s had an how you see that playing out as a driver for client going forward.  And then maybe also touch on some of the other divisions, I\u2019m thinking particularly the MBD division with Office where anti-piracy has some potential to effect results as well.\nChris Liddell: Sure, it is an interesting trend Charlie and it\u2019s a good one to call out.  Historically we\u2019ve seen the difference between the unit shipments that we have relative to the overall PC market.  A benefit in our anti-piracy of 1-2%, so our sales if you like grow 1-2% faster than the market as a result of taking piracy away.  Over the last couple of quarters that\u2019s picked up, it was around 5% in the first quarter and around 3% in the second quarter. So that\u2019s giving us the confidence to raise in terms of our expectations that to the 1-2%, more like 2-3% going forward.  If you say, why is that happening, there\u2019s a few factors.  Firstly, better enforcement, so we\u2019ve had a significant enforcement activity over the last few quarters, something like 74 legal actions in 22 countries, so working with local governments who are becoming much more sensitive to this as an issue and very strong government partnerships from us.  We\u2019ve seen some of the technology advances in Vista helping us, relative to previous additions of Windows.  Also we\u2019ve seen a shift to laptops and in particular sales through multi-national OEMs who typically have a lower piracy rate. Now, not all of those factors are beneficial from a revenue point of view, you know the average selling price through large multi-national OEMs is typically lower than in the smaller entities, but overall from a unit perspective it\u2019s helping us about 3% and it\u2019s offsetting some of the mix shift that we see and some of the other factors and so it\u2019s just been a very good trend and it certainly in the last two to three quarters has picked up from what we\u2019ve seen in previous two to three years.\nColleen Healy: And then I would say as a broader theme, the company is focused on piracy really across all of our software offerings, including Office and MBD as you also asked about.  With Office it\u2019s tougher to quantify than we can with client because with Office we sell through so many different channels, volume licensing retail as well as OEMs.  We estimate about half of the worldwide base out there is pirated, so there is opportunities to make gains there as well.  And we\u2019re doing a lot of those same sort of partnering with governments and educating people on the value of buying genuine software and keeping an eye really on retail sales of Office to see how that\u2019s progressing.  And you know it\u2019s been really robust since the launch of Office 2007, but unlike client we can\u2019t give you a specific of a number in terms of how we\u2019re doing on piracy.\nCharlie Di Bona: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan, your line is open.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon.  I wanted to drill down on the strength in MBD and Office which has been a consistent theme over the last several quarters.  Another quarter of better than 20% revenue growth in business office and related.  I wanted to see if that is primarily unit driven at this point or whether you\u2019re actually starting to see an ASP uplift on the Office side and how long do you think you can sustain better than 20% growth for business revenue?\nChris Liddell: Yeah, firstly, specifically, it is very much around units, it\u2019s not ASP driven.  And I\u2019d pick out a couple of themes in particular.  One is just customer acceptance of the Office product itself which has been extremely good, you know it\u2019s right at the top end of our expectations.  So when you talk to people, their like of the product is extremely high and we\u2019re seeing that manifest itself from a financial perspective and very strong license sales right across the board.  So from consumer to small business to large businesses, the underlying office business and the office product has been a real success since launch. That\u2019s number one, number two is some of the other products are starting to become significant in their own right, so when you look at Sharepoint, growing over 20-30% year on year, that\u2019s over $1 billion business now, so it\u2019s a significant business in its own right and it\u2019s incredibly successful again in terms of customer acceptance in rollout through the enterprise. Unified Communications a similar story.  Some of the Dynamics products, CRM and ERP which don\u2019t get a lot of attention because we focus on the big parts but also growing at 30-40% growth.  So you\u2019re seeing a very strong portfolio of products anchored around the Office product but with some extremely good secondary ones as well making a big contribution.  How long can that last?  Well we will start to lap the launch of Office 2007, so that impact won\u2019t be necessary be a significant going forward, but if you look at the second half guidance we certainly see a lot of the same factors for the first half continuing to the second half.\nAdam Holt: If I could actually just ask a follow up on that.  You mentioned in your prepared comments that you\u2019re taking a little bit more of a conservative view on spending in the US for the second half.  As we think about the back half guidance, how should we or where do you think that\u2019s being reflected, it looks like you\u2019re being conservative against a tough comp on the PC growth expectations, where else are you reflecting that conservatism in the guidance?\nChris Liddell: Well I don\u2019t think, when you look at the growth rates, they\u2019re still very healthy in the second half so when we think about product portfolio we actually feel very optimistic for the second half.  Certainly, if there\u2019s you know a substantial economic slowdown you could see PC growth rates come down but we\u2019re guiding for the second half in 11-13% or thereabouts so it\u2019s still very healthy growth from an overall perspective.  You look at individual verticals, probably we can find a couple of soft spots, but each of those individual verticals represents less than 5% of our sales and they\u2019re made up for by strength in other areas.  So when you look at the combined portfolio of our products, what we\u2019re being, it\u2019s just like everyone else about what might happen in the US economy, when you look at the overall suite of product we have and the overall growth rates we have, we actually feel very optimistic.\nAdam Holt: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much, when I look at the double digit operating profit percentage of the reported in the entertainment and devices business, despite having a record Xbox unit quarter, how should we think about the margin profile of this business going into the next fiscal year.  Are you at the point that console costs have been driven low enough and you\u2019re getting a healthier mix of software due to rising attached rising attach rate.  It looks to me that the business [unintelligible] for a breakout on operating margins but how do you think about that looking into the next two to four quarters?\nChris Liddell: Yeah, well the first thing to note is as we\u2019ve talked about before the first time we start talking about fiscal year \u201909 is in April, so happy to make some comments about it then.  In these calls we\u2019re really trying to focus on this fiscal year, it\u2019s the main purpose.  In terms of some of the underlying drivers though that you can think about when you start populate your model, you know one of the things to point out is a very, very good attach rate for Xbox. So we\u2019re looking at a life to date average attach of 7 games per console.  You know, interesting when you look at that now people on average are spending more in terms of the software and accessories than they are on the underlying console itself, so that model of selling the console as a way of generating future revenue is really paying off.  That 7 on average is well above anything historically were on on previous consoles.  So that\u2019s a very healthy leading indicator. But the entertainment and devices division is much more than just the Xbox, there\u2019s obviously a music player in there, Windows for Mac and various other parts of it as well, so there\u2019s other dynamics when those mobile that are going to play in terms of our investment in the future.  We\u2019re not making any long term predictions about the margins structure, the one thing that is positive is its clearly profitable and we believe on target to be profitable for the year which is the commitment we made some 18 months ago.\nKash Rangan: Thanks and also one metric that you gave last quarter was the bookings growth rate in the core business being 25%.  What was the same number this quarter, I do see that overall bookings growth rate was 20% but I was just curious about the core business?  That\u2019s it thanks.\nChris Liddell: Yeah, greater than 20%.  I\u2019ll look if I can give you a more detailed number after the call but certainly off my head it\u2019s greater than 20%.\nOperator: John Difucci from Bear Stearns, your line is open.\nJohn Difucci: Thank you.  Chris, you talked a little bit about US risk and I think you were quoted in Routers I think after the close today saying something similar.  Did you see any of it this quarter, I mean the aggregate results were obviously pretty impressive, but the server and tools division was a little bit below your expectations and that\u2019s really enterprise infrastructure software in aggregate, did you see it and is that what you\u2019re seeing now, is that an area where you might be seeing a little more pressure than perhaps some of the other areas?\nChris Liddell: Actually you have to look really hard to find any weakness in our results in the first half.  So, in terms of server and tools, there was actually a shift to an annuity mix, so that may be what you\u2019re looking at, in fact that\u2019s a positive trend because it means our unearned is up significantly which we reported as you know over $500 million higher than expectations and it\u2019s a reflection of our company\u2019s commitment to our products as a platform in anticipation of some of the server products coming up.  So from an accounting point of view you notice a difference, from an underlying business point of view that\u2019s an incredibly positive trend. But if you look at the first half of the year, I mentioned over 60% of our sales come from customers outside the US.  If you look at non-US, it grew over 20%, non-US mature markets, if you look at emerging markets, it grew at almost 30%, but the interesting factors that I didn\u2019t say which I\u2019m happy to say is that US markets are up 15%.  So that\u2019s a total our sales in the US for the first half grew by 15%.  Now, clearly if the softness going forward, that would impact that, but that\u2019s still a very healthy growth rate from our point of view.\nJohn Difucci: Yeah but I would think you would expect that shift to an annuity at the beginning of the quarter when you gave guidance and it was a little bit shy there but are you saying you just didn\u2019t expect that and it was customer driven?\nChris Liddell: Yup, absolutely.  There\u2019s a vast number of contracts that come up for renewal every quarter and the nature of how those renewals flow through to annuity mix quite significantly quarter on quarter.  But yes it was an unexpected positive surprise.\nColleen Healy: You\u2019re seeing on the low end on server and  tools as revenue is about a $20 million miss and on the unearned balance you\u2019re talking 100\u2019s of millions, net-net on a bookings point, server and tools although the mix was different, the business was just healthier actually than we had expected.\nChris Liddell: Thank you.\nOperator: The next comes from Ben Thill with Citi Investment Research.\nBen Thill: Thanks, Chris can you characterize any meaningful differences in consumer versus enterprise demand.  Are you seeing any changes in patterns in each of those two divisions?\nChris Liddell: No, they\u2019re broadly in line with our expectations and in terms of the enterprise, as I mentioned and Colleen just referred to, the unearned balance is extremely good and so we\u2019re feeling good about the relative commitment of our enterprise customers to multi-year agreements, so that\u2019s good.  On the, I mentioned about Office and the strength there. A lot of very good license earnings sales in the Office area right across the spectrum of businesses from small medium and large businesses.  And lastly on the Xbox side, you know the consumer sales are very good, that\u2019s a good leading indicator of consumer acceptance and I guess the last one would be PC sales overall which poured in to 16% in the quarter was a hit of our expectations.  So really everything was slightly better than what we had hoped for but there wasn\u2019t any significant mix change if you like, all those factors were good.\nBen Thill: And just as a quick follow up, just as you look at the second half of this calendar year, how would you characterize your visibility and I guess the confidence of this macro overhanging the US, doesn\u2019t catch up, I think you mentioned there were a couple soft spots, what gives you confidence that this doesn\u2019t spillover into some of the other sectors in the US and catch up with you later in the year?\nChris Liddell: Well we\u2019ve just gone through our mid-year reviews with where we go country by country and segment by segment across the world and the sales force, so the people who are in charge of delivering.  Their results, sitting in on all of those and listening to them certainly is factored into our guidance.  And you know at this state we\u2019re obviously not giving fiscal year \u201909 guidance but again you have to take a step back and look at the overall environment we\u2019re selling into. The next six months we feel very good about.  In terms of more general factors, we\u2019re a global company, I talked about the sales mix, I feel good about global GDP over the medium to long term, I think software spending is going to be faster than global GDP and I think we\u2019re going to grow faster than overall global software spending.   So could we be impacted by global slowdown, of course we could, but if you look at the overall growth rates from the products we have and the markets we compete, we still feel very good if we think about our business on a multiyear basis.\nBen Thill: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Our next is Jason Maynard with Credit Suisse.\nJason Maynard: Hey good afternoon guys.  I had a little different tact on the questioning.  I\u2019m just curious to get your opinion on how you expect the recent EU commission new investigations to play out and what impact you think that may have on not only Vista but I guess perhaps the not yet released Windows 7 product that\u2019s being talked about?\nChris Liddell: Yeah, overall obviously we\u2019ll cooperate fully with the commission\u2019s investigation and provide any and all information necessary.  We\u2019re committed to insuring that we\u2019re in full compliance with their law and our obligations as established by the court.  So I don\u2019t really have a sort of general business comment, happy to leave it at that.\nJason Maynard: Is this, post the settlement I guess was like three or four months ago, is this is any way shape or form impacting perhaps your M&A strategy or maybe decisions to do something bigger within the online services area?\nChris Liddell: No, not at all.\nJason Maynard: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And the last question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks so much, Chris I had a quick follow up question on the online business.  Specifically, where is it you\u2019re spending the money for the investment you\u2019re making now.  Is that around infrastructure or R&D, sales, and then secondly, where do you envision that going, is it just always going to be an online advertising business or do you see a point where you charge for content or applications, music, any of these other potential revenue streams?  Thanks.\nChris Liddell: Yeah the investments are across a broad spectrums o we believe to be successful in that business you really need to commit substantially across the whole gamut of investments, so we\u2019re investing in search, improving the relevancy of our search results, focusing on some key verticals like commerce, local entertainment, health.  We\u2019re obviously investing in the advertiser and publisher tools.  You know after our aQuantive acquisitions that\u2019s given us a substantial leg up in the advertising platform area, so we\u2019re continuing to build on that. We\u2019re investing in content and services through Windows Live and other Live services through the MSN portal and then lastly but not leastly in operational infrastructure.  So a lot of [tapics] going into data centers to improve performance and reliability and generate global sales for the business and some of those costs are feeding through in terms of depreciation.  So there is no one particular area that we\u2019re focused on, we are focused on all the areas and we think to be successful in that business going forward, that\u2019s the approach you have to take.\nBrendan Barnicle: And then second question in envisioning where it goes?\nChris Liddell: Yeah, just go over that one again.\nBrendan Barnicle: Yeah, I mean do you ever see a point where you may charge for content, charge for applications or are you always going to be basically in online advertising and advertising driven type model?\nChris Liddell: Well we\u2019re obviously moving to a software plus services world, so there are certainly areas of products that we have where you can see us moving from a license only to a on demand situation.  We already are, in terms of the basic online advertising business as you think about OSB, to a large extent that\u2019s going to be an advertising driven, advertising supported business.  But there will be other parts of the business you know as we already are with CRM, delivered online and charged for on a subscription basis where it won\u2019t be advertising driven.  So we\u2019ll live in a multi-business model world going forward.\nColleen Healy: Great, thanks a lot Brendan and thanks everyone for your participation in today\u2019s call.

Thanks forjoining us. I\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with highlights from our first quarterperformance and how we see the rest of fiscal 2008 shaping up. The first quarter represented an outstanding start to thefiscal year, with every part of the company performing at or aboveexpectations. In particular, we are very happy the consumer demand across ourtotal product range propelled revenue, operating income, and earnings per sharegrowth by 27%, 32%, and 29% respectively. Also, we successfully closed aQuantive and a number ofsmaller acquisitions, and we continued setting the platform for future growth withthe availability of products and services, such as an updated live search, BizTalkServer, Silverlight, Performance Point Server, Halo 3, and Office CommunicationServer. In terms of our financial performance, there are some keytrends that I would like to highlight. On the revenue side, the benefits of ourmulti-year product cycle are obvious. Q1 was our fastest growing first quarterin seven years, with revenue up 27%, or $3 billion, over Q1 of last year. Theperformance was across all positions, customer segments, channels, andgeographies. Looking specifically at the growth coming from our variousgeographies, emerging markets continued to be a strength. The nations that makeup the G7 grew 29% for the quarter, but even better was an over 40% increaseturned in by the combined group of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. A quarter like this demonstrates how enlarging ourgeographic presence has positioned us to benefit from the continued worldwideeconomic expansion. We also did a good job this quarter of converting revenuegrowth into profit growth. Operating income grew five percentage points fasterthan revenue, expanding our operating margin from 41% to 43%. Solid marketing and sales execution, combined withefficiency on operating expenses, kept costs in line with expectations. Earnings per share was up 29% over last year, up to $0.45,assisted by our ongoing share buy-back program. Given the start in the firstquarter, the acquisition of aQuantive, and an improved outlook, we areincreasing our revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance forthe year. We now expect revenue growth of 15% to 17%, and this wouldput the top end of that revenue approaching nearly $60 billion, representing a$2 billion increase over our guidance in July. We are also increasing our operating income and earnings pershare guidance, the latter to a range of $1.78 to $1.81, $0.08 to $0.09 higherthan our previous outlook. With those high level things for the quarter and 2008, I amgoing to turn the call over to Colleen now for more details on how we closedout the first quarter.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we are off to the fasteststart for revenue and operating income growth of any recent fiscal year. Let meprovide you with details of our financial performance, starting with revenue.I\u2019ll discuss top line financial and business momentum points and then follow upwith revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I\u2019ll review therest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparablequarter of last year, unless otherwise specified. Revenue increased 27% to $13.8 billion, significantlyexceeding our expectations by over $1 billion. Every business grew atdouble-digit rates, with particular strength in client, the business division,and server and tools, which grew in excess of 20% combined, as well as growthof over 90% by our entertainment and devices division. The underlying PC hardware market was strong, with estimatedgrowth of 14% to 16% during the quarter, about three points higher than ourexpectations. From a customer segment standpoint, the business PC shipmentgrowth rate increased almost three times to over 12%, while continuing to beoutpaced by the consumer segment. From a geographical point of view, PC growth rates inemerging markets continued to outpace that of mature markets, driven by robustgrowth in Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which grew a combined 20%. Europeand Canada led the mature markets, while we began to see recovery in the U.S.and Japan. Our mix of product billings for the quarter was approximately35% from OEMs, 25% from multi-year agreements, 20% from license-only sales, andthe balance from our other businesses. Non-annuity sales were particularly robust, which isconsistent with the post product launch stage for Windows Vista and the 2007Office system. Strong annuity licensing performance with enterprise agreementrenewal rates consistent with historical trends drove our unearned revenuebalance 15% higher to $11.6 billion. Our [contracted and not billed] balance increased sequentiallyto over $11 billion. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookingfor the company grew an impressive over 30%. I will close out the revenue overview by adding that changesin foreign exchange rates added about two percentage points to our overallrevenue growth and was slightly above our forecast heading in to the quarter. Now, I will provide revenue highlights by business segment,starting with client. Since Windows Vista became available for consumers,client revenue has grown over 20% on average. This quarter, a rapidly expandingpersonal computer market, progress against software piracy, and three quartersof Windows customers adopting premium versions drove client revenue to $4.1billion, an increase of 25%. OEM revenue, which makes up over 80% of client revenue, grew25%. After adjusting for three points of revenue recognition fromdeferred revenue, OEM revenue increased slightly faster then OEM unit shipmentsof 20%, due to a higher mix of Premium Windows SKUs. Consumer premium units grew over 150%, while businesspremium units grew closer to 11%. As a result, the OEM premium mix increased by16 points to 75%, driven by a 19-point increase in the consumer element ofpremium mix, and partially offset by a three-point decline in the businesselement. Because business premium SKUs have a five-to-one pricingimpact over consumer premium SKUs, these changes in the premium mix havelargely offset any impact to revenue. Client, commercial and retail licensing, which makes upabout 20% of client revenue, increased 23%, as business customers continue toadd client products to their annuity agreement. During the quarter, we saw a 27% increase in the clientvolume licensing portion of the unearned revenue balance. We view this to be apositive leading indicator of intent by businesses to deploy Windows Vista. Server and tools revenue increased 16% to $2.9 billion,driven by strong annuity license growth in Windows Server and SQL Server, whichwe are happy to see ahead of the upcoming new releases. More specifically, we saw healthy unit growth in our WindowsServer business, particularly in our premium enterprise edition SKU, which grewby over 35%. And SQL Server unit and revenue growth each exceeded 15%. During the quarter, we release Silverlight, a Windows homeserver. We also gained significant product development momentum with betareleases of Visual Studio and SQL Server. Since the availability of the initialrelease candidate of Windows Server about a month ago, it has been downloadedover 1 million times, indicating high interest in the coming final products. Our consulting revenue increased 32%, as we\u2019ve experiencedhigher utilization rates following the recent business product launches acrossthe company. Online services business revenue grew 25% to $671 million,including $80 million for the half quarter of aQuantive revenue since close.Excluding aQuantive, consistent with the way we guided you back in July, growthwas in line with our expectations. Online advertising growth for the quartergrew 33%, or 25% before aQuantive. Microsoft Business Division revenue grew 20% to $4.1billion. As a result of our focus on delivering greater desktop value tobusiness customers, we achieved double-digit revenue growth across a broadrange of products within our Office system, unified communications, andbusiness solution areas. Looking at how the various customer segments performed,revenue from business customers jumped 25% over the prior year. We benefitedfrom strong, mid-market transactional sales and good Enterprise demand forbusiness productivity infrastructure, such as SharePoint and enterprise [COW]. Healthy sales through retailers for the back-to-schoolseason helped drive consumer growth in the quarter. Entertainment and devices revenue grew over 90% to $1.9billion, driven by higher-than-expected console sales and Halo 3, whichachieved the biggest entertainment launch day in history. The strong demand forHalo 3 generated approximately $330 million of Microsoft revenue in thequarter, as well as significant consumer interest for the X-Box 360 console. X-Box 360 console units increased over 90%, with over 1.8million units sold. This was driven by our August price cut, excitement aroundHalo 3 generating console demand, and an earlier ramp-up to the holiday seasonin anticipation of the most compelling line-up of game titles available on anyplatform. In addition to the success of Halo 3, X-Box 360 continues tolead third-party games sales against all current generation platforms, which isnot only good for us and our gaming audience, but also good for our gamedeveloper partners in the X-Box ecosystem. For example, according to NPD for the U.S., all four of thecurrent generation third-party titles in the top 10 last month were for theX-Box 360. Infact, over the last year, game developers have seen their titles hit the top 10list 27 times for X-Box 360 compared to only twice for the PS3 and only oncefor the Wii. This helps X-Box 360 software attach rates remain at record levelsfor any console at this stage in its lifecycle. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenueincreased three points to 19% of sales, primarily driven by the high volume ofX-Box 360 unit sales, increased consulting business, and expanded onlineservices operations. Operating expenses increased 11%, dropping from 43% of salesto 38% of sales. Expense growth was largely in line with headcount growth andis tracking to our expectations, despite the higher-than-expected revenue asgenerated during the quarter. Operating income grew faster than revenue at 32% to $5.9billion, exceeding high-end guidance by $750 million and expanding ouroperating margin by two percentage points. Investment income and other totaled $298 million for thequarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, half a point higherthan we previously guided. Cash flow from operations increased 45% to $5.9billion. Cash flow from operations outpaced operating income due to collectionson the large volume of business close at the end of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we repurchased 81 million shares, or$2.3 billion of company stock. $2.9 billion settled in the quarter due to thehigh volume of repurchases at the end of fiscal year 2007, and we paid out $938million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 9.5 billion,down 5% from the prior year as a result of share repurchases. Earnings pershare for the quarter were $0.45. So in summary, we are extremely pleased with this quarter\u2019sperformance. Revenue for the fiscal year is off to the fastest start in recenthistory, fueled by strength across our products launched over the last ninemonths. Operating expenses came in line with expectations while generatingsignificantly higher-than-expected revenue. This resulted in operating incomegrowing faster than revenue at an impressive 30% clip. With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide youwith our second quarter guidance and outlook for fiscal 2008.\nChristopher P.Liddell: Thanks, Colleen. Before we get into the specific guidance,let me outline some of our key underlying assumptions. First, our fiscal 2008forecast assumes stable macro economic conditions through the remainder of thefiscal year. We remain optimistic about the overall outlook for the ITindustry. In mature markets, we haven\u2019t seen a spillover from problems in otherareas of the economy, although clearly the risk of an economic slowdown hasincreased. Emerging markets in particular appear healthy to us. Notonly are we getting the benefits of strong growth offshore, but it is assistedby stronger international currencies. The FX impact alone we believe will addabout one point to our yearly revenue growth. Overall, our business is benefiting from our diversificationacross products, channels, geographies, and customer segments. We are increasing our expectations for PC unit growth forfiscal 2008 by one percentage point to 10% to 12% for the year, and 11% to 13%for the second quarter. Growth rates in both the Asia-Pacific and EMEA regionsappear to be stronger than we thought coming into the year. We estimate thatthe growth rate will continue to be higher in the consumer segment and thebusiness segment, and recent regional trends should continue with growth inemerging markets outpacing that of mature markets. Now let me go through our detailed guidance. For the fullyear, we expect our revenue to come in between $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion,growing 15% to 17%, up four percentage points from our last guidance. The full year forecast now includes revenue from aQuantive,which contributes approximately one point of revenue growth. The remainingthree point increase from July is driven by an improved outlook for our threebusinesses of client, the business division, and server and tools. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of $15.6 billionto $16.1 billion, which represents a year-over-year increase of 25% to 28%. With that, revenue guidance in our divisions is as follows:for client, we expect full-year growth to be 12% to 13%, and second quartergrowth to be 62% to 64%, or 13% to 14% excluding certain revenue deferrals inthe prior year. For the full year, we expect OEM revenue to grow in line withthe PC hardware markets. On the commercial and retail side of the business, we expectdouble-digit growth for the year from continued demand through our volumelicensing channels. The client growth rate benefits by two percentage pointsfor the full year and by four percentage points in Q2 from recognition ofundelivered elements, consistent with our guidance in July in both percentageand absolute dollars. Server and tools revenue should be up 16% to 18% for theyear, and 16% to 17% for the second quarter. We expect double-digit growthacross our server platform products and services. The division is completingthe new releases of Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio inpreparation for the upcoming launch event starting in February. These productswill allow IT departments to be more productive by providing them with asecure, trusted, scalable and manageable platform that will underpin growth inthe server and tools business over the next several years. We forecast revenue in the online service business toincrease 33% to 37% for the year, and 32% to 35% in Q2. This implies onlineadvertising growth in excess of 30% for the quarter and for the year. This guidance includes the revenue from aQuantive, whichadds approximately 25 points of growth for Q2 and for the full year. Organicrevenue guidance for the fiscal year is unchanged for both the business groupand advertising. We\u2019re aiming to become one of the major players in theonline advertising space, and we are pleased by the progress we are making inputting the building blocks in place. For example, the launch of our new searchproduct with much stronger relevance, using industry standard measurementmethodology; our core algorithmic relevance is now on par with the market leaderand better than all other search engines in the U.S. market today; we saw solidgrowth, 23%, in our display business; we saw rapid growth in our live IDs,growing 19% to over 400 million; our partnership, which we announced yesterdaywith Facebook; and the acquisition and successful integration of aQuantiveduring the quarter. We will continue to invest in this business, as we\u2019ve toldyou before. For example, in building a differentiated search experience in thefour high value verticals of commerce, local search and mapping, entertainmentand health, which collectively represent 40% of all global searches. Microsoft Business Division revenue should be up 14% to 15%for the year and 31% to 33% in the second quarter. Normalizing for the impactof the technology guarantee and pre-shipment deferrals in the prior year, thesecond quarter growth should be 15% to 16%. Looking at the applied growth rate from the second half,I\u2019ll remind you that due to last year\u2019s strong sales of the 2007 MicrosoftOffice system, we will have tough comparisons but are predicting double-digitgrowth nevertheless. 2008 is another important product launch year for thebusiness division, as we roll out our offering in the important investmentareas of business intelligence and unified communications. These two areas areprojected to have a combined addressable market size of about $65 billion in2009, representing sizable growth opportunities for the division. Performance point server, which is our business intelligenceoffering, had over 10,000 customers on its CTP program, an amount larger thansome competitors\u2019 installed bases. In unified communications, Office Communication Server alsohas been gathering interest, with over 80,000 beta downloads of the software. The entertainment and devices division, we\u2019re forecastingrevenue growth of 15% to 20% for the full year, and flat to down 8% for Q2. OurQ2 revenue growth, however, should be viewed in conjunction with theearlier-than-expected ramp-up of console sales in Q1 in preparation for thecoming holiday season. If you look at our overall, for the first six months --that\u2019s the first quarter and the second quarter combined, growth would havebeen about 15%. [inaudible] has historically comprised almost half of industryhardware and software sales. With competitively priced console bundles andaccessories, combined with a great first and third-party software titleline-up, we feel very good about our position heading into the holidays. We also look forward to bringing more choice to digitalmusic consumers with our expanded families of Zune devices and updated musicmarketplace and new software updates, such as podcasting support, new wirelesssend and sync functionalities, and an attractive user interface. And in appreciationof our early Zune adopters, the new software features will be updateable tocurrent owners\u2019 devices as well. Turning back to company-wide performance, operating incomefor the year is expected to be between $23.3 billion and $23.7 billion, increasing26% to 28%. Our higher revenue forecast is responsible for the improvement versusour July guidance, as we expect over half the incremental revenue to flowthrough to operating profits. For the second quarter, we expect operating income to be between$5.9 billion and $6.1 billion. As a result of the higher operating income guidance, we areincreasing our full year earnings per share results to $1.78 to $1.81,including a $0.01 impact from integration and deal costs associated withaQuantive. This is an increase of $0.08 to $0.09 on a GAAP basis, or $0.09 to$0.10, excluding deal costs. For the second quarter, we expect $0.44 to $0.46. Theseearnings then assume both for the year and for the quarter an effective taxrate of 30.5%. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect total unearnedrevenue to finish fiscal 2008 up 8% to 10%, in line with our prior guidance.Excluding deferred revenue for undelivered elements, the remaining portion ofunearned revenue should increase 14% to 16%. When thinking about sequential changes in unearned revenuefrom Q1 to Q2, we expect the balance to follow historical patterns and remainroughly flat. Contracted not billed should also finish 2008 up from currentlevels. It is clearly important, especially in the currentenvironment, that you consider some of the risks of this forecast. These risksinclude competitors, legal, execution, and general market risks, such asforeign exchange rate movement, fluctuations in PC and server hardware growthrates, and consumer acceptance of our new and existing products. Additionally, changes in the mix of our billing betweenannuity and license only can have an impact on revenue, operating income, andearnings per share by delaying revenue recognition in the future periods. So to wrap up, the first quarter was an outstanding startfor the year. A strong PC hardware market, healthy demand by business customersfor our product, and overwhelming consumer response to the launch of Halo 3helped propel us to the fastest Q1 revenue growth in seven years. To put that in context, our revenue base is about 2.5 timeslarger than it was the last time we grew this fast. The fact that we can beatthe law of large numbers is a tribute to our products and sales teams. Good execution and cost discipline allowed the majority ofour revenue upside to flow through to operating income, and for the balance ofthis year, we will continue to deliver the strategies for shareholder value weoutlined at our financial analyst meeting in July, in particular, driving ourtop line growth, continuing to invest in technology offerings that will providethe platform for future growth, and using our strong cash flow and balancesheet to benefit shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, I will hand the call over to Colleen so we canget started taking some of your questions. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Okay, great. Let\u2019s proceed to questions. We want toaccommodate as many questions as we can from as many of you, so please avoidmulti-part questions and please limit yourself to just one question. Operator,can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes fromHeather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering if you couldgive us an update on your view of Vista adoption thus far, and in particular,how the uptake of premium SKUs, both on the consumer side and also with VistaEnterprise, are tracking versus your original expectations, and how should wethink about that going forward?\nChristopher P.Liddell: Clearly we are very happy with the client division overall.As you\u2019ve seen since we launched Vista, the revenue growth has been in excessof 20% three quarters in a row, so the overall [headline] number, very good. In terms of the premium mix, also very happy about that.Now, in this case, premium mix brings in both Vista and XP premium sales aswell, and that\u2019s tracking in the mid-70s, so 75% for the quarter, and thatcompares to I believe 59% in the equivalent quarter last year, so up 16 pointsyear over year. So we\u2019re very happy with the adoption of Vista Premium and alsohappy with the old XP Media sales as well. The other thing I\u2019ll point to is on the client annuityagreements, which is probably the best leading indicator we can think of ofpeople\u2019s intention to adopt, that\u2019s still very early in the adoption cycle forbusinesses, but the volume licensing portion of our business was up 27% in theclient area, so that\u2019s a very good leading indicator from our point of view. And sort of finally, as a wrapper, year-to-date sales arenow 85 million units for Vista. That compares to about 45 million for XP overthe same period, so almost twice as much. So it\u2019s still early days but progress, we\u2019re very happy withso far.\nHeather Bellini: And just on the premium SKUs, would you say that they aretracking above what you guys had expected when you originally launched theproduct?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Yes.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon, and I\u2019ll also let go the congratulations. Ihave two questions on the business uptake. In particular, you had a meaningfulacceleration on the client side in terms of business units and I was hoping maybeyou could detail what you thought was behind that acceleration. And then on the Office front, still another quarter ofbetter than 20% Office growth on the business front. Where do you think we areon the enterprise upgrade cycle for Office? Thank you.\nChristopher P.Liddell: Sure, Adam. We\u2019ll start with client. The business saleswere, to be honest, a function of underlying demand, so the PC unit came in at14% to 16% for the quarter overall, compared to our expectations of around 10%to 12%, so we saw a good uplift in overall PC units, and that was both on theconsumer and the business side. I think the benefit that we saw on the business aspect wasprobably most particular in some of the emerging markets, so we saw goodstrength in business and that really helped us with the anti-piracy andlegalization aspect of our growth. So if PC units grew by 14% to 16%, ourshipped units that we were paid for grew by 20%, and all of that delta waseffectively a fight against unlicensed PCs, so the growth that we saw in thebusiness segment, in particular internationally, really helped us in terms ofoverall unit sales. So felt very good about that and we still think thatconsumers will grow faster than businesses, but overall a very good story onthe client side. In terms of the Office, that has a slightly differentimpact, mainly because it\u2019s a much stronger impact from annuity there ratherthan non-annuity sales, although interestingly, non-annuity sales, whichtypically go to smaller businesses, were strong as well, which is a very directimpact with Office. In the annuity sales, which tend to have a multi-yearimpact, you recall I talked last quarter about how we saw a very strong sign-upfor maturing agreements right at the top end of our expectations, and that wasreally a very good leading indicator of people\u2019s acceptance of or expectationthat they would roll out Office, but also the other products in MBD. So it\u2019sclearly strong from our point of view that people are seeing not only a valuein Office, but products that are related to Office, for example, in the unifiedcommunications and business intelligence area. So overall, we\u2019re feeling good about the rollout.\nAdam Holt: Terrific. Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Great. Thanks a lot, Adam. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSara Friar: Good afternoon, everyone. I think everyone is going to saycongratulations, but it is quite an amazing quarter you put up. Following onone more comment on the client Vista adoption side; I think a lot of folks hadthought SP1 would be the catalyst. Why do you think we saw it a little bitahead of that and do you have a timing update on SP1? And then I just have aquick follow-up question, if I may, after that.\nChristopher P.Liddell: Vista adoption, as I say, it is still early and I talkedabout intention to adopt rather than actual adoption. I think you are rightthat certainly some businesses will be waiting for SP1 to roll it out, but interms of their willingness to sign up for the client element of the multi-yearagreements, their intention to roll out is I guess signaled by that. So it isstill early days as to what the actual adoption numbers are, and we think itwill increase during the year and obviously will be helped to some extent bySP1. But some of the leading indicators are what we feel good about.\nSara Friar: And then just turning to the EDD division, great quarter. Itseems like you do think there was some pull forward on consoles just based onyour guidance. Is there anything implied in your guidance on broader commentaryabout health of consumer spending in the fourth quarter? Are you leavingyourself a little bit more cushion there?\nChristopher P.Liddell: No, it\u2019s principally around the pull forward, as youmentioned. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I tend to look at the businessfor the first six months rather than the quarters. In particular in the firstquarter, console sales were 1.8 million units, which is relatively small. So itwas ahead of our expectations, but it\u2019s a quarter where you can beatexpectations because the volumes are small. I mean, Halo was obviously a clearbeat but in terms of consoles, I\u2019d rather think that the volume over that sixmonths, because there\u2019s a lot of stocking in anticipation of Christmas going on,and movements like that. So I feel good about it. There\u2019s no particularsignaling on weakness for Christmas. In fact, we feel very good about theline-up we\u2019ve got, not only from the box itself but obviously the gamesassociated with it as well.\nSara Friar: Terrific. Okay, well, thanks a lot.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Sara. Next question, please.\nOperator: Charlie Di Bona with Sanford Bernstein, your line is open.\nCharles Di Bona -Sanford Bernstein: I guess no surprise here, but I\u2019m going to go back to thewell on OSB. It was probably the only division that didn\u2019t really outperformsignificantly, only about 10% growth, excluding aQuantive, and the comScoreshare is back down to sort of the lows that they were in your fiscal Q4. Especially in light of yesterday\u2019s announcement aroundFacebook, maybe you can give us a little insight into the strategy andexecution here, and is there any shift towards sort of buying traffic andcommunity rather than building it internally? And in general, how do you gobalancing those two alternatives and valuing those two alternatives?\nChristopher P.Liddell: First thing to note obviously is we met expectations, so itwasn\u2019t a beat, I agree, but it was a meet, so start with that. Underlying business growth or revenue growth, you mentionedthe 10%, which is correct. Clearly in this case it\u2019s a negative from the Accessbusiness going away, so -- if you look at underlying revenue growth, underlyingadvertising revenue growth, it grew in the mid 20s, around 25% for the quarteryear on year, which we think is acceptable. It\u2019s nor certainly stellar. We\u2019dlike to see it higher but it\u2019s acceptable and it is higher than where we guidedat the start of the year, roughly speaking. So I think reasonable progress onthe organic side of the business. In terms of putting the building blocks in place and how wetrade off organic growth through inorganic growth, it\u2019s both. The strategy hasbeen both and will continue to be both, so we are investing heavily in the organicaspects of the business, so a lot of investment in particular has gone into thesearch product itself, and we clearly are extremely happy with the improvementswe are seeing on aspects like relevance, which are critical going forward. Weare putting a lot of investment into things like data centers, which arecreating the platform of the future and the experience, so we are increasingCapEx quite considerably there. We are looking at CapEx overall for the year of$3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, about half of which is going into the OSB area.And we are putting investment in some of the verticals that I talked about onsearch organically and all the other areas as well, content on the displayside. So there\u2019s a strong organic side, there\u2019s a strong inorganicside, but clearly aQuantive is the most obvious representation of that andwe\u2019re particularly happy that we not only closed aQuantive but we\u2019ve retainedall of the employees. We think that integration has gone extremely well and webelieve that\u2019s going to generate some significant benefits going forward. We also did some other smaller acquisitions, ones which wethink are important for the ad platform, like AdECN during the quarter, andthen the announcement yesterday on Facebook, which is a willingness on our partto make a commitment to a multi-year agreement with a partner who we think hasgot some tremendous growth opportunities. So we are willing to do both. We are quite clearly willingto suffer an operating loss in that position as a result of those commitments,and we\u2019ll share that there I think both in our financial analyst meeting and inour guidance. But to date, in terms of underlying financial metrics, we\u2019reon track. In terms of some of the other things that we wanted to do, if anythingwe are slightly ahead of where we would like to be.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Charlie. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill -Citigroup: Thanks. Good afternoon. Chris, I think your guidance for thefiscal year implies roughly a 40% operating margin, and clearly with Q1, it washigher than 40%. Why do you expect the operating margin will drift to thatlower level for the year?\nChristopher P.Liddell: Overall for the year, we feel very good about the operatingincome growth relative to revenue growth and it will still be an increaseyear-on-year. So there\u2019s some COGS impacts, for example, the mix of COGS duringthe course of the year and we just saw an outstanding performance in the firstquarter, some really, really strong growth in particular in client and MBD. We think that out-performance is going to continue, but notat the same rate, so operating margins improve but I think quarter one was justan outstanding one in terms of our ability to take the revenue out-performanceand drive it to the bottom line, and as I say, there is a different COGS mix tothe rest of the year, which impact it as well. But overall margin, we are going to grow operating incomefaster than revenue growth this year, which means our margins are going toexpand, and the other impact which you know I\u2019ve talked to you about is weexpect earnings per share to grow very fast as well, backing out all of theone-offs, if you like. We think EPS is going to grow faster than 20% this year,which is the benefit of the operating margin expansion and also the benefit ofthings like share buy-backs flowing through. So at this stage of the cycle for the company and for acompany that started to grow earnings per share greater than 20%, upsignificantly from where we were, we feel good about it.\nBrent Thill -Citigroup: And just one quick one, if I could; relative to enterprisedemand, it sounds like it\u2019s improved slightly over the past couple of quarters.Do you think it stabilizes from here or has room to improve even from here?\nChristopher P.Liddell: It\u2019s just the renewals. It was back to more traditionallevels in the first quarter and that\u2019s about two-thirds of the three-quartersramp that we talked about, so we saw a particularly good renewal rate in thefourth quarter and we are back down to more traditional levels, but levelswhich we feel obviously very good about, so I don\u2019t think -- we\u2019re notexpecting an out-performance or an increase back to the very, very good levelsthat we saw in the fourth quarter, but if we can maintain traditional levelsand obviously start to sell the new product range that we have coming throughto our existing clients, and hence get the benefits of all of the additionalproducts that we\u2019ve either launched or are going to launch, [that is up] verywell from a business point of view in terms of overall billings growth.\nBrent Thill -Citigroup: Thanks, Chris.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Brent. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Bear Stearns.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks. Just a follow-up question I guess to Brent; themargins were really impressive here, Chris, and even next quarter, you have ameaningful increase in revenue and a pretty I guess meaningful decline inoperating margin. Is there any reason for us to think that you can\u2019t do a lotbetter than what you are saying here? I mean, I understand what you are sayingabout the COGS, but it looks like it is something that can continue.\nChristopher P.Liddell: Probably the first thing to do is to normalize of aQuantive,so that may be distorting the numbers. But we are bringing that in for thefirst time and that\u2019s bringing in revenue but no operating income -- in fact,with amortization of intangibles, it will be a slight loss for the year. Sothat\u2019s probably a drag on the margins that you might want to normalize for, orat least give us the benefit of. If you take that out, the way that I look at it is what isour ability to meet our operating expenditure guidance and potentiallyoutperform on the revenue side, as opposed to drive the business on a marginbasis. And I would say I\u2019m particularly happy with the fact that we deliveredincreased revenue in the quarter whilst keeping operating expenditure literallyright on guidance. You\u2019ll recall from last year, I was certainly happy that wedelivered the whole year right on operating expenditures, so I feel really goodabout the business groups, discipline, the sales force discipline to a largeextent keeping operating expenses under control, which will allow us to, theextent that we beat revenue, to drive it to the bottom line. I can\u2019t promise this is necessarily going to significantlyincrease margins, but it will increase margin every dollar that drops through,and perhaps if you back out aQuantive, that will give you a better comparison.\nColleen Healy: From a fiscal year on fiscal year, I mean, if you arelooking at organic, fiscal year \u201907 you were see us sort of a bit above themid-30s. You pull out aQuantive and legal charges and tax, guaranteed bonds andthe rest of it, for the year you are sort of in that 40% range, and then ofcourse, with Q2, given that X-Box with the hardware is such a big driver forholiday, Q2 for the year, in terms of for the year, you\u2019d probably see a dip,but year on year, when you look at the true underlying organic, pulling outaQuantive and some of those other things, you are going to see I think prettygood margin there, John.\nChristopher P.Liddell: aQuantive will -- to help you, and obviously we\u2019ll have togive more detail as we go on, but aQuantive will add $500 million of revenuefor the year. We will pull out deal costs and IP R&D that we write off ofclose to $100 million, but we\u2019ll still leave in things like amortization ofintangibles, which we know other companies tend to call out. We\u2019ll leave thosein, which means that will be a drag on the operating income of close to acouple hundred million towards this year. So perhaps that will help younormalize for that.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, John. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Good to see a quarter like that andmore particularly, the stock break out to a multi-year high. That\u2019s got to lookgood. I just have a question on the online business, Chris. It looks likeyou\u2019ve done a good job restoring or bringing profitability, let\u2019s say, to theentertainment and devices business. At what point are we in making similarprogress on the profitability of the online business, especially with aQuantivebeing integrated into the operations of the company? And as a follow-up, I was also curious to get your thoughtson the client side. I know you do [inaudible], and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, andthere\u2019s some concerns in certain segments of Wall Street that there might be aninventory issue on Wall Street, especially on the PC side. Intel had a goodquarter, you guys had a good quarter, but with retail sort of weakening or atleast suspected to weaken during the holiday season, who knows, I\u2019m justwondering if you share that concern and if you don\u2019t, what specifically makesyou feel that this inventory build-up could actually lead to sell-through inthe Christmas holiday season? Thanks.\nChristopher P.Liddell: Entertainment and devices and OSB are really at differentparts of their business cycle. It was a very strong commitment from our pointof view to try and drive profitability in the entertainment and devicesdivision this year, and we feel like we are on track for that. So they are on,if you like an upswing to a part of their business cycle where we believe wecan be profitable. In the OSB case, there isn\u2019t a primary driver of thebusiness at the moment. The primary driver is to invest in the right areas andcreate the platform for a very strong growth in economic value over the nextfew years. So it\u2019s not one where we are the [clearly the] -- but if we wereprofitable, but it is one where it is not going to be our primary determiner ofsuccess this year. I will be keen to ensure that the expenses come in wherethey are. I\u2019ll obviously be keen to see that our revenue growth is in line withexpectations, but assuming we meet those two things, it is going to be a lossfor the year. So they are just different -- the businesses are atdifferent parts of their business cycle, and so we have different tests againstthem. On the client side, we are not seeing any significantinventory issues that we are aware of, and so from our point of view, if youlook at the guidance, we feel good about PC unit growth guidance of 11% to 13%.Anything in double digits or greater we think is good and that\u2019s like a sell-innumber, using your terminology. So we think that\u2019s good and we think we shouldbe able to drive OEM units in our area around that same level. So there\u2019s noparticular issues of significance that we are aware of.\nKash Rangan: It just looks like the emerging markets and the [inaudible]countries, perhaps business there is accelerating and that\u2019s why your OEM unitsare looking better than they have in the last few quarters?\nChristopher P.Liddell: That\u2019s absolutely right. Those countries really did anoutstanding job -- countries like Russia, the business overall grew there bygreater than 100% in the OEM area and client grew by something like 50%. Sosome of those countries are growing at a tremendous rate, which is a functionof the underlying economies growing well, but as we see business growth inthose areas and a greater desire to obviously have legitimate PCs, we areseeing good progress on piracy as well, and that\u2019s really helping us with ouroverall OEM unit.\nKash Rangan: Great. Thanks a lot.\nColleen Healy: Thanks a lot, Kash. We have time for one, maybe two more questions,please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Banc ofAmerica.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. Chris, I might be jumping ahead a littlebit here, but clearly you guys haven\u2019t seen any slowdown in terms of demandaround either SQL Server or Windows Server 2008 in front of those launches. Whatis your expectation in terms of the impact of those launches on the growthrates? Do you think that we\u2019ll see demand come in at a steady pace? Or do youexpect that as we get into the back half of the year, that can help acceleratethe growth rates in that division? Thanks.\nChristopher P. Liddell: I think it will help continue the growth rates that we\u2019veseen, to a large extent. You have to realize that the structure of our businessreally has matured significantly to one that\u2019s driven much more aroundmulti-year expectations. So people are -- to the extent we\u2019re seeing strengthin annuity agreements now, it\u2019s an anticipation of those products. The factthose product launch won\u2019t in itself drive an enormous amount of accountingactivity. We\u2019ll see that over a slow -- to a large extent, that\u2019s the samephenomena we talked about with Vista. These things will happen over time aspeople adapt and adopt the particular systems. But from a revenue and economic point of view, ourrelationship with our customers, our ability to continue to sign them up anddrive growth is much more of a multi-period rather than a single event basedphenomena, and we just think a continuation of very strong products rolling outcontinuously quarter after quarter, year after year, is the best way of drivingthat business.\nKirk Materne: Just a really quick follow-up on Windows Server 2008, thebeta for Veridian is still expected to be released with that, with thefull-blown version released 180 days afterward? Is that still on track?\nChristopher P.Liddell: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much.\nColleen Healy: Great. Thanks so much, and our last question, please,Operator.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brandon Barnicle from PacificCrest Securities. BrandonBarnicle - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks so much. I just have two quick ones. Chris, first onpremium edition, obviously a great move, year over year up 75%. As we have SP1come, where we potentially get more enterprises pulling in, can we see thatpremium edition even move up higher still? And then secondly, over on aQuantive, have you given anythought again to the agency business and whether that\u2019s something that stayswithin the business or needs to be divested? Thanks.\nChristopher P.Liddell: Yeah, we are very happy with XP business. That\u2019s continuedto do a great job. I mentioned before, I think the integration has goneextremely well. As far as we can tell, the employees are very happy, who arerunning the XP business in particular on a standing independent basis andreally letting them continue getting on with their life. We think it is a verygood business and no intention to do anything other than continue to run it. On the client side -- just go over your question again,sorry.\nBrandon Barnicle -Pacific Crest Securities: Premium edition, 75%, very impressive. Can we see it go to85%?\nChristopher P.Liddell: We\u2019re just looking -- in terms of our guidance and ourthoughts and what\u2019s embedded with, we believe we can continue to drive that atover 70%, but too early to predict anything higher than that.\nBrandon Barnicle -Pacific Crest Securities: And would SP1 have any impact on accelerating that?\nChristopher P.Liddell: It might help but those rates of 70% are very high, so -- itmight assist but it may just simply just help us continue at that sort of rate.So we are not [anticipating] a particular pick-up as a result of that alone.\nBrandon Barnicle -Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you very much.\nColleen Healy: Thanks, Brandon, and thanks everyone for joining us today.If you have any further questions, please feel free to call me or my teamdirectly.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay, now let\u2019s hear from Chris.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter marks the end of one of the most difficult but in some ways encouraging fiscal years in the company\u2019s history. Our absolute results were disappointing due to the poor macroeconomic environment and as you\u2019ve seen, revenue in the fourth quarter was down 17% year over year and down 3% for the full year. However, I do feel better about our relative performance in fiscal 2009 than I did in fiscal 2008. We actually executed much better than in preceding years across almost all aspects of our business, we had great product shipments, strong sales execution, and a new level of internal discipline shown by the speed and efficiency with which we cut costs. So in my mind, we are a stronger company than we were a year ago -- however, the economy continues to be challenging and we need to lift our game to another level in fiscal 2010. As I said a quarter ago, we see the economy making its way through a [reset] and we expect tough year-over-year comparables for the rest of this calendar year. Having said that, there are some signs that we have at least seen the worst. We began to see sequential stabilization in some of our key businesses; for example, we saw sequential unit increases in both Windows and Windows Server for the first time in a year. I am also very pleased with the way in which we are responding to the environment. In the fourth quarter, for example, we cut costs an additional $800 million below the low-end guidance we provided in the third quarter and ended up spending $900 million less than the prior year, adjusted for certain charges. Overall, we pulled back over $3 billion of spending from our original fiscal 2009 guidance. Despite cutting costs this year, we also brought to market a strong wave of products in full and on time. Notably, we released SQL Server 2008, Office Communication Server R2, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Bing, our major advance search product offering. Over the next 12 months, we will deliver releases in each of our core franchises of Windows, Windows Server, and Office. So in summary, our market conditions were clearly difficult in the quarter but we successfully offset most of the impact by focusing on factors inside our control. Looking forward, we do not expect trading conditions to improve much but neither in the short-term do we expect them to worsen. They should remain difficult for the balance of this calendar year with the potential for improvement as we look ahead to calendar year 2010. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the fourth quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Chris. I will start with the company all-up view and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. All of the growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I tell you otherwise. Overall, revenue declined 17% because of continued weakness in global demand, especially in the business PC and server hardware markets. On top of the economic reset we\u2019ve all experienced this year, remember that we had especially high prior year comparables for our client and entertainment and devices segment. The foreign exchange impact on overall revenue was a negative $220 million, or about 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the quarter was also impacted by $276 million in deferrals for the Windows 7 technology guarantee program, which is near the high-end of the guidance we provided in June. The weak hardware markets continue to weigh heavily on OEM and license-only revenue, while multi-year annuity licensing revenue grew single digits, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. Our product mix continued to shift toward our annuity licensing, which was up a few points from last year to about 45%. OEM billings accounted for about 25%, license only sales were about 15%, and the balance came from other businesses. Within our customer segments, we generally saw last quarter\u2019s trends continue. Specifically, small and mid-market customers are still the hardest hit by the economy and as a result, we are seeing lower overall buying activity. In the consumer segment, we are still seeing healthy volumes in our lower priced offerings with softness in our premium offering. Our enterprise customer segment remains relatively healthy with EA renewal rates in line with our historical range. As you might expect, the average deal size has been pressured by reduced IT budgets and enterprise employment levels, though we haven\u2019t seen any unnatural discounting. We also experienced some sales cycles which pushed deals out of the fiscal year. Our sales force closed many of these deals a few days after our fiscal close but in line with our normal deal calendar, which differs slightly from our fiscal calendar. Taking into consideration the impact of these bookings, our unearned revenue and contracted not billed balances were roughly flat year over year. We are very happy with this result, considering the economy relative to a year ago. Okay, now let\u2019s move on to the revenue and business drivers by segment, beginning with our thoughts on the PC market. We estimate the overall PC hardware market declined 5% to 7% from last year. Within that, we estimate traditional or non-netbook PCs were down 16% to 18% compared with the year-ago quarter. We\u2019ve seen substantial weakness in the business PC market as reduced IT budgets have delayed hardware purchases and refresh cycles. The netbook category remains strong, representing about 11% of the total PC market this quarter. With the growth of netbooks, we estimate the consumer PC market was flat to down slightly year over year. On a sequential basis, we estimate the PC market was up low-single-digits. From a geographic perspective, the market was strong in Asia-Pacific, particularly China, as a result of the stimulus programs. In North America, demand appears to have normalized, with sequential sales in line with historic seasonality and in EMEA, we saw demand continue to deteriorate. With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at Windows Client. Client revenue was down 22% from last year when adjusting for the Windows 7 tech guarantee. The decline was primarily driven by the underlying PC market dynamics I discussed, combined with the impacts of a difficult comparable to last year. Overall OEM unit sales declined 10%, a few points under the overall PC market due to year-over-year inventory fluctuations. If you\u2019ll recall, our fourth quarter of 2008 represents tough comparables as OEMs built inventory above historic levels. Attach rates were relatively stable year over year. Strong attach rate gains on netbooks were offset by some attach rate pressure on traditional PCs due to the geographic mix of the PC market, particularly in China where attach rates are lower. Again here, I want to note some sequential trends. Sequentially, our OEM units grew slightly ahead of the underlying PC market, mainly driven by netbook growth. This was the first sequential unit growth since the September quarter, so we are pleased to see some stabilization in the market, even though it\u2019s in lower priced units. Overall OEM revenue was down 24%, adjusting for the tech guarantee, driven by the PC market dynamics and the mix shifts toward our lower priced netbook offerings. Specifically, sales of premiums SKUs declined over 25%, mainly due to the lower sales of business PCs I covered earlier. The commercial and retail portion of the client business was down 16%, driven by declines in retail sales prior to the Windows 7 launch. We saw an exciting level of interest in Windows 7 during the pre-order period, although revenue for these sales won\u2019t be recognized until Windows 7 general availability. We continue to have healthy growth in our client enterprise annuity business, which was up single digits in the fourth quarter. Yesterday Windows 7 was released to manufacturing. This is an exciting milestone for our R&D teams and our partners, delivering not only a terrific product but one that\u2019s nicely ahead of the schedule we committed to almost three years ago. As we\u2019ve announced, Windows 7 general availability will be October 22nd. Now let\u2019s move to server and tools, where revenue declined 6%. Our license only and OEM business declined slightly less than the estimated 24% drop in the underlying X86 server hardware market. On a sequential basis, we were pleased to see that Windows server units were up after falling the prior two quarters. Annuity revenue was up single digits, in line with the guidance framework we gave last quarter. FX rate changes were a two-point headwind to revenue during the period. We are still seeing great adoption of our virtualization solution, which drove growth of the premium editions of Windows Server and system center to healthy double-digits. On a product front, yesterday we announced the Windows Server 2008 R2 release to manufacturing, which builds on the value of Windows Server with live migration and high availability, and together with Windows 7 Enterprise edition provides new capabilities, including direct access and branch cache. In addition, during the quarter we released Silverlight 3, which adds new functionality to run Silverlight applications offline. Moving on to the online services business, revenue declined 13%. Online advertising revenue was down 14%, mainly due to the significant decline in display advertising rates across the industry. Partially offsetting this was continued growth in page views. Search revenue for the quarter was flat year over year despite industry-wide monetization declines. FX rate changes were a headwind of five points to online advertising revenue and three points to total OSB revenue. Most significantly for this business, during the quarter we launched Bing, our new search engine which has had positive early momentum. Unique users of Bing.com grew 15% in [Q4]. We\u2019ve seen particular strength in the areas of shopping and travel as visitors to Bing shopping almost tripled and Bing Travel traffic was up 90% month over month since launch. It\u2019s still early but we are executing and we are optimistic about the future of this business. The Microsoft business division revenue was down 13% due to declines in consumer and business purchasing. Our consumer OEM and retail portions of the business continued to be impacted by slower PC sales, as well as lower ASPs. Pricing promotions drove higher attach rates but overall consumer revenue declined 30%. Business revenue was down 10%, driven by an over 35% decline in our license only sales. The annuity portion of this business was up single digits, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter. Within the MBD products, we continue to see double-digit growth in our SharePoint, Office Communications Server, and CRM products. CRM achieved the 1 million seat milestone this quarter. Our notes conversions remain strong. For the year, we converted 4.7 million notes users to exchange and SharePoint. We\u2019ve seen more and more customers choosing our online business services, which include hosted communication and collaboration solutions like Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. For example, during Q4 we had significant customer wins of over 200,000 seats moving to Exchange and SharePoint Online. In the entertainment and devices division, revenue decreased 25%. The Xbox 360 business had a solid quarter, selling about 1.2 million consoles, which is down on a year-over-year basis due to inventory restocking last year. Overall this year, we\u2019ve sold approximately 11 million consoles, 28% above last year. Xbox attach rates are still the best in the industry, growing to 8.6 software titles for each console sold. For the year, Xbox Live grew over 50% to more than 20 million members and in the last six months, the number of paid Xbox Live downloads has jumped 73% year over year. Now for the rest of the income statement, cost of revenue was down 10% or $280 million, driven by lower Xbox 360 console costs and reduced costs from our consulting and support services, partially offset by increased online distribution costs. Operating expenses decreased $766 million, or 11%. This quarter\u2019s results were impacted by $193 million of legal charges and $40 million of additional employee severance charges. Expenses were reduced by the capitalization of $105 million of certain R&D costs related to Windows 7 technical feasibility. Adjusting for these items, operating expenses were down about $900 million for Q4. The savings were driven by a combination of strong operational execution, the impacts from lower revenue driven expenses and rigorous cost controls across the company. For the year, as Chris mentioned, we took out over $3 billion of operating expenses compared to our original guidance. Other income and expenses was a gain of $155 million and includes $108 million of impairments on investments as a result of the market declines earlier this year. Our effective tax rate was 26.5% for the quarter, in line with the guidance we provided. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 8.9 billion, down 5% from the prior year. Earnings per share were $0.34. After excluding the net impacts from the legal charges, severance charges, and capitalization of R&D costs, and investment impairments, EPS was $0.36. The Windows 7 tech guarantee revenue deferral resulted in an additional $0.02 per share impact on EPS. So to wrap up, while the environment clearly remains challenging, we are executing diligently on the areas we can control and in the fourth quarter, we delivered meaningful cost savings and outstanding progress on our product pipeline. Lastly, one housekeeping item before I turn the call back over to Chris -- we have included an additional slide in our earnings presentation to help you model some recent organizational and reporting changes we have made which are effective for fiscal year 2010. With that, I will hand it back to Chris who is going to discuss our business outlook.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Thanks, Bill. So the rest of the call, I will cover our broad expectations for the first quarter and trends for fiscal 2010. So let\u2019s begin with some of the key assumptions on the industry and the economy. We generally expect the economic conditions we saw in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to continue through the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We believe the spending environment is stabilizing on a sequential basis but remained substantially below year-ago levels. We see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010 and acceleration there afterwards, but clearly exact timing is uncertain. Regardless of the macroeconomic conditions, we feel extremely good about our relative position and our product delivery plans. Macroeconomics may be the winner in the short-term, but product quality will drive medium term growth. So in my view, the shape of the year will therefore be probably the most interesting of any year in recent memory. While I remain cautious overall, particularly in the short-term, we expect to exit the fiscal year with the combined momentum of an improving economy, potentially improving business spend, and an outstanding product lineup. With those macro themes, I\u2019ll turn to segment expectations. In the first quarter, client revenue is expected to align to traditional PC shipments, excluding the impact of the tech guarantee program. We expect those traditional PC shipments to decline on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter but be up sequentially, continuing the trend we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. In the first quarter, we expect to defer between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion from the Windows 7 tech guarantee program and presales, the majority of which will be recognized in the second quarter of the fiscal year. For the full year, we expect client revenue to align with the total PC market, which factors in the launch of Windows 7 and the resulting impact to retail sales, combined with the anniversary of netbooks in the year-ago comparison. This implies that we could see client revenue growing faster than PC shipments by the end of the fiscal year. Microsoft business division revenue, which is approximately 20% consumer and 80% business, is correlated to both the underlying PC market and IT spend. We expect consumer revenue in the first quarter to lag traditional PC shipments by several points, continuing the trends in the third and fourth quarters, but also impacted by [higher] inventory levels in the year-ago period. For the full year, we also face a normal cyclical slowdown in advance of the next version of Office, which will release to manufacturing in the second half of the fiscal year. The business portion of the Microsoft Business Division includes non-annuity and annuity licensing. Business non-annuity sales, approximately 20% of the division, will lag business PC shipments by several points both in the quarter and full year, as a result of the general market weakness of small and mid-market customers, as well as headwinds in advance of the next product cycle. The dynamics of the remaining annuity business will be broadly flat for the full year and for the quarter. This helps us buffer through the reset. However, it will be a transition year for MBD and I don\u2019t believe we will see overall revenue growth until we start to see a recovery in the small and medium business and consumer sectors, combined with the impact of Office 2010. The server and tools business includes non-annuity components, long-term contractual agreements, and our enterprise services business, which represents approximately 30%, 50%, and 20% of revenue respectively. In the first quarter, we expect non-annuity revenue to continue to reflect weakness in the server hardware market, which external analysts expect to decline on a year-over-year basis through the calendar year and then improve in calendar 2010. We expect server and tools annuity revenue to be mid to low single digits in the first quarter and in the full year. Enterprise services revenue should be broadly flat this coming year. Online service business revenue excluding our legacy access business should mirror the online advertising market, which we expect to remain weak in the first quarter and potentially through the year. Display monetization rate should reflect the headwinds seen in broader industry trends but volumes from increased usage should be healthy. We also hope to see progress in the search market share as the year proceeds. The entertainment and devices division has been resistant to the declines in the gaming industry to date and clearly was a standout in fiscal 2009. Looking forward, weak consumer markets means that we expect industry console sales and attach revenue to moderate in both the first quarter and the full year. These segments represent 60% to 65% of revenue. The balance of the non-gaming business will be impacted by continuing weakness in the underlying PC market. Turning to COGS, which next year should increase as a result of three factors -- firstly, we are changing our business model in a number of areas as we transition to the cloud. This means an investment up-front to build out the infrastructure necessary to win in what is clearly a significant area of opportunity. We are also paying for increased distribution in our online offerings. We also expect increases as a result of increased unit volume from the product launch cycle next year. Offsetting these increases, we\u2019ve identified and expect to achieve several hundreds of millions of dollars of savings through an internal program focused on efficiencies. The combined impact of these factors will increase COGS as a percentage of revenue by a couple of percentage points. I will now turn to our expectation of full year operating expenses -- full year operating expenses we believe will be between $26.6 billion to $26.9 billion, down from the $27.4 billion I communicated in April. And next year, we remain committed to expense control. Our effective tax rate next year we expect to be between 25% to 26%, depending on the final mix of revenue, and reflecting the downward trend we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong despite the economic turmoil this past year. This quarter we utilized our Triple A credit rating and issued $3.75 billion of long-term debt and extremely low after-tax cost of 2.3%. We also remain focused on customer credit issues and to date have had an extremely good collection experience. We expect fiscal 2010 CapEx to be about $2 billion, down from the $3.1 billion in fiscal 2009, and to stay at or below that level for fiscal 2011 as we continue to focus on cash flow. In fiscal 2010, CapEx spend will be below depreciation expense for the first time in years, helping continue the recent trend of free cash flow being greater than net income. As I called out in April, capital strength and flexibility will continue to be a focus area for fiscal 2010 but we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So in summary, like all customers we are adapting to a new and more challenging economy. We remain extremely optimistic about the long-term outlook of our industry and our relative position and we have taken significant actions to strengthen the company while at the same time investing in critical areas and delivering on a significant wave of new products. The company is in, in my belief,  the best shape that I\u2019ve seen. With that, we look forward to seeing many of you next week at our financial analyst meeting where Steve and our senior leadership team will provide more details about our long-term strategy. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill so we can start taking your questions.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, let\u2019s get going on questions. Can you please hold people to just one question and let\u2019s go ahead and go.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. My question is about average selling prices as we head into the upcoming Windows cycle. You know, the premium mix of 59% in the quarter was obviously down quite a bit. As you head into next year, Chris, I believe you talked about the potential to outpace the PC market, which would suggest average selling prices can actually start to go back up. How do you get there? Do you expect to see mix improvement on the consumer side? Are you expecting to see a corporate upgrade cycle? Maybe walk us through A, what you are expecting and B, how you get there?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure, it\u2019s a great question. On the downside, if I start there and then talk about the upside, on the downside, as we are seeing weak markets in the last couple of quarters and the last year and in particular, the last quarter average PC sales were down sort of in the traditional market 16% to 18% and business was disproportionately badly affected. And because business is typically our highest ASP from a mix point of view, that hurt us on the downside. On the upside, as we go into next year, if we start to see, which is certainly my hope, if we start to see the economy improve, business spending improve, and we start to see a refresh cycle in the business PC side of things, which Windows 7 should obviously help facilitate, then you start to see the reverse impact, so hopefully business PC growth will be at or greater than consumer, and so what you will start to see is that our higher average selling price units will have a higher growth rate and hence, ASPs will go up. So hopefully we\u2019ll see a double impact of a better PC market year over year and a better mix in terms of the types of PCs that we are selling relative to average selling prices.\nAdam Holt: Terrific. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, the commentary on expenses for next year, do you anticipate the incremental OpEx cost controls to offset the increase in cost of goods sold?\nChristopher P. Liddell: No, they are two different dynamics. We certainly have taken some money out of OpEx and relative to where we started from, certainly quite considerable. I certainly see the focus continuing in that area but we are managing OpEx to a large extent different from COGS. Now, we do actually have a project going looking at COGS opportunities and as I mentioned, I think we have the opportunity to take several hundreds of millions of dollars out of our cost of goods sold through that project. But then we have the dynamic of the changing business models going on and also volume related activities, so that\u2019s really a different dynamic from OpEx, which is driven around, for example, people costs in particular.\nAdam Holt: Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Chris, just on the margins coming into the mid-30s, do you feel that margins have now bottomed, considering the ASP expansion as well as your strict operating expense controls for next year?\nChristopher P. Liddell: It comes back to some of the commentary I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Brent, which is really around the shape of the year. So I still will see a relatively different difficult economy for certainly the balance of this calendar year and despite the fact that I think we have done a great job on expenses, it\u2019s hard with the margin structure we have to take expenses out proportional to the revenue that we lost. So I would like to think that the expense controls were at the top end of people\u2019s expectations but we still saw margin compression because of the macroeconomics. That\u2019s going to be probably a continuation of that trend in the short-term. In the medium term, I certainly think the discipline that we are showing on costs as we continue through the next calendar year and beyond with an improving business cycle with all the products coming on-stream and some of the ASP factors that I mentioned, and certainly we\u2019ve got the promise of margin expansion there afterwards, but I wouldn\u2019t promise that in the short-term.\nBrent Thill: Okay, and just a quick follow-up -- the buy-back, you now have a cash position above $30 billion again. Can you just comment on why the last two quarters, you\u2019ve chosen not to buy back stock?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Basically look to -- obviously relatively conservative because in the last couple of quarters, we felt we couldn\u2019t necessarily see the bottom. I think that at least we are seeing signs now of the bottom, so we are feeling more confident looking forward in the outlook, even though as I see it, I -- I see it going along the bottom for some period of time. I was more conservative from a financial point of view six months ago and even three months ago, if you\u2019ll recall my remarks. I said it was going to be tough for the rest of the calendar year and we are really still not sure we are out of the woods. Now, I\u2019ll still say that but I guess we are feeling better about the economic environment but unless, in that last six months, conservatism won over the natural desire to buy back shares, and we did accelerate the buy-back to some extent in the first six months of the year, so even for this fiscal year in total, we bought back around $8 billion of shares, which was close to our net free cash flow. So we front-ended it a bit in the first six months of the year and then just took a very conservative stance in the second half.\nBill Koefoed: Okay, Operator, next question and guys, let\u2019s stick to one question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from  Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Could you give us a little bit of commentary on what you have heard from customers in terms of both their willingness to start a Windows 7 upgrade? So you are clearly signing a lot of ELAs this quarter. They must have been talking about that. And then secondarily, in server and tools, do you also feel like there was any pent-up demand ahead of the new product upgrade cycle in the June quarter, and now you have that launched as we look into September?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I\u2019ll start with server and tools first, Sarah -- the market is still very weak and Bill mentioned server shipments were down, I think it was 24% for the quarter. So I don\u2019t think we are yet seeing too much pent-up demand in the server area. As it turned out, even though our results were relatively weak, they were better than the server shipment numbers, so the division lost 6% in revenue but that 6% is relative to a 24% decline in server shipments. So we are certainly feeling good about our relative position but I would contrast that and say we don\u2019t yet see a lot of pent-up demand in that area. Going into next year, sure. But it\u2019s really macro conditions are going to continue to trump everything. We really need to see an increase in IT spending before I feel confident that we are really going to see an acceleration back in the server and tools area. Now, I\u2019ve seen your forecasts and everyone else\u2019s, and I think most people are saying we\u2019re probably at about the bottom in the server area. We are probably going to be that way for a quarter or two and then things improve next year. That\u2019s internally consistent with the way  that we see things as well, plus then we start to get the benefit of the new  server product and the new SQL product, so it\u2019s a consistent story in the server area as it is in the PC area. When you go to PCs, we haven\u2019t heard a lot of early discussion about how people are going to put Windows 7 in but again, it\u2019s that same general sense of optimism that once we get through this year, people start to reset their budgets for next year, clearly a lot of businesses have extended their refresh cycle because of overall economics. They can only do that for so long. As they start to look into next year, hopefully a slightly better economic outlook, they start to look at refreshing their PCs and they have Windows 7 availability, then you start to get into a much more virtuous cycle. So there\u2019s similar commentary to what we see in server and tools -- nothing immediately on the horizon but potentially start to see some positives next year.\nSarah Friar: Got it. Great, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from  Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Chris, just to clarify a point -- as you talk about the economic rebound or the expected rebound and volume rebound in the back half of the fiscal year, just to be clear on the expense side of the equation, is the organization at a place where we can be fairly confident that the upside is not reinvested into the business as we\u2019ve seen in other cycles?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Yes, certainly for this fiscal year, I don\u2019t see any potential for us to significantly vary from the numbers that I gave you. The only reason why it would would be something outside our control, like foreign exchange, so some of our expenses are outside the U.S., if we saw a significant change in the FX rate, then I can\u2019t influence that. And things like some of our volume related expenses, so if we saw a really strong pick-up in some of our enterprise sales, some of our revenue driven expenses might increase. But in terms of things, which is the great bulk of the expenses which are totally inside our control, I don\u2019t see any potential for us to blow expenses this year.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Chris, you had talked about September client revenue growing in line with traditional PCs and in the most recent quarter, we saw that you guys declined about 600 basis points more than traditional PCs. What accounts for the difference from this quarter to next quarter that would I guess raise you back up to the decline in the traditional PC rate?\nChristopher P. Liddell: The biggest single factor is just inventory changes. We still saw inventory contraction in the fourth quarter, the one we just finished, relative to a year ago. So some of the other parties out there saw positive inventory. We were relatively late in the cycle so we saw inventory contraction and that cost us a lot of that 600 points that you mentioned year over year. As we start to go into this year and clearly Windows 7 is just around the corner, then we start to see that inventory position stabilize and even potentially over the course of the year start to actually get better on a year-over-year basis, which is one of the reasons why I feel better not only about the first quarter but how we might exit the year as well.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: I have a question back on expenses again -- if you guys ex out some of those one-time charges, you know, the legal charges, severance, et cetera, FX, R&D costs, you ran an OpEx about 25.5 this year and obviously you are guiding 26.6, 26.9 next year. Just given the fact that most of the headcount reductions occurred in the second half of the fiscal year, how should I think about that increase in OpEx that you are guiding towards? Is it just a little bit of conservatism or is it because of all the product launches that you do have coming out, you know, marketing investment, sales, et cetera. How should I just think about that increase?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure. We set our budgets a month or two ago before we saw some of the savings that we had in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s the first point to make. In terms of the year-over-year, the factors that are likely to see an increase are, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve got some fairly significant product launches next year, so we do have some marketing associated with those that we are intending to spend. We are seeing some other factors, like non-cash charges associated with depreciations, so even though CapEx is going down next year, some of the deprecation [inaudible] from the increasing CapEx is starting to feed through. Stock comp, which is also non-cash, is going up as we layer investing. Acquisition amortization, if we do any acquisitions, which we provide for, some of the non-cash amortization will impact expenses next year as well, and then we have [inaudible] from pay raises last year, so we\u2019ve got no pay raises this year but we did have some pay raises last year, so the full year impact of those. So there\u2019s a series of relatively small items which add up to the increase that you are seeing. But we did, as I mentioned, we did actually cut back expense to for next year, despite all of those things which are likely to happen. We did cut them back from where we originally were.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.\nTodd Raker: I just wanted to dig back into unearned revenue. I didn\u2019t quite understand the discussion in terms of timing -- that was flat year over year. So if you could just touch on that, and if you just talk about the annuity business in general, are you seeing any indications that the annuity business is decelerating, even ahead of a Win 7 product cycle?\nChristopher P. Liddell: We have a slight difference in timing with our field year relative to our fiscal year. Our fiscal year is clearly June 30 but our field year can be either a day or two short of that or a day or two longer than that, just in terms of -- depending on whether they -- when they close their books. So from a fiscal year point of view, unearned was down but if you include the couple of days after the fiscal year to when the field closes their books, then it was basically flat and that\u2019s how we tend to look at it internally because that\u2019s the -- the field cycle is what essentially drives customer behavior. So essentially flat is either half full or half empty, depending on how you look at it. Half empty is zero is down from the double-digits that we were getting in previous years; the half full is getting flat bookings in the current environment, which is the worst economic contraction of our lifetime, is actually heroic effort in terms of our field sales. So inside that flat bookings or flat billings, you are basically seeing two dynamics. The renewal rate is similar to what we have been receiving traditionally, so that -- from two-thirds to three-quarters renewal rate that we have quoted in previous years actually held true this year, which was a very good performance from the field. What we are seeing that is different which is meaning that we are flat rather than double-digit increase, is that the people aren\u2019t increasing the number of seats that they are taking, so clearly an environment that we\u2019ve got, most businesses are flat in headcount or even contracting, so you are not seeing that uplift from the increased number of seats. And people are much more conservative with what they are buying, so we are getting certainly good growth from things like SharePoint but that\u2019s really just holding the line in terms of keeping them dollar for dollar with the rate at which they are coming off. So average level of -- you know, on a contract by contract basis, the number that we renewed in line with history, what\u2019s changing is the dollar value of those contracts, which is leading to sort of flat year-over-year performance.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. When I look at the deferred revenues, it looks like we definitely got a sequential improvement, so that\u2019s got to give you some visibility. And Chris, you also talked about the transactional revenues which I think you quantified to be down 20% year over year in the March quarter. I was wondering how that metric fared in the June quarter and should we think about that metric in the June quarter as potentially the bottom, because the other pieces of your business are fairly coming off the balance sheet, if you will? So I\u2019m just wondering if -- whatever that transactional growth was in the quarter or contraction was in the quarter, do you really think that this could be the bottom and that that transaction growth could actually pick up in the September quarter and beyond?\nChristopher P. Liddell: The transactional business, it depends on whether you are talking about client, server and tools, or MBD --\nKash Rangan: Combined, everything combined.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Yeah, it\u2019s in the 20% to 25% contraction if you do all of those combined. So if you think about  overall PCs down sort of that 18, 16%, 18%, you see server and tools, server hardware down 24%. Then the transactional business really follows those quite closely, adjusted for things like inventory, that I mentioned before. So if you think on average that our underlying hardware shipment decreases were in the 20% to 25% range on average, then that\u2019s what the transactional business was as well, plus or minus a little bit. So do I think that\u2019s the bottom? Yes, I do think that\u2019s the bottom but as I probably said in my prepared remarks, I think it\u2019s probably going to continue to be tough for a quarter or two so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily promise that it\u2019s going to be significantly better but if you look at a combination of say the first and second quarter, that\u2019s the first half of the year, then that\u2019s probably a good surrogate for the transactional business for the second half of the calendar year, the first half of this fiscal year and the confidence of that is really in terms of that sequential trend that we mentioned in our prepared remarks.\nBill Koefoed: Doe that help, Kash?\nKash Rangan: Yes, and just a clarification on the COGS, you said you were working on some internal initiatives to drive COGS down, and you also said that given the transition of the cloud, that COGS was going to go up by 200 basis points. Were you talking net or gross? That is, in other words, COGS goes up by 200 basis points but you also have these internal initiatives that could drive COGS down by hundreds of millions of dollars, so should the net number then be lower than the 2% of revenue hit?\nChristopher P. Liddell: The 2% is net of the initiatives that we\u2019ve seen. Now clearly if we outperform on that, we will offset it by more but that was a net figure that I was giving you, so the combination of the infrastructure costs associated with that, some of the distribution deals that we\u2019ve done, the volume related, because clearly with the Windows 7 launch, that has a lot of COGS associated with it, is offset by the things I talked about to give the 2% decrease.\nKash Rangan: Got it -- increase, you mean?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Increase, decrease in gross margin .\nKash Rangan: Okay, got it. Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from  John DiFuca with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn DiFuca: Thank you. I have a follow-up to Brendan\u2019s question earlier -- a question on the channel effect on client. Chris, a few quarters ago, you said that client was negatively affected by I think 2 percentage points and then last quarter I think you said there was a slight negative effect. Now this quarter it sounds like it\u2019s the majority of that six percentage point delta between OEM and PC shipments. I guess two things here -- well first, I would think that this is a cumulative effect, so when it comes back and it does reverse, how would you think this will come in? Will it come in over a long period of time when inventories build? Or is this going to come in relatively quickly in one or two quarters? I know you are not suggesting it is coming in anytime soon, the economy is weak out there. And the second point, why wouldn\u2019t it happen, you know, soon? Like next quarter? It does sound like some of the component vendors benefited from inventory restocking this quarter, so why wouldn\u2019t -- you do say you guys are later and you lag but why would it be a long lag?\nChristopher P. Liddell: All great questions -- so first to start with the underlying math, assuming inventory went down three quarters ago and stayed down, then year over year you are always going to have a negative, so the fact that it\u2019s negative quarter after quarter doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s continuing to contract. It just means it contracted and stayed down. Having said that, in the fourth quarter contracted a bit more and you\u2019re right, the two or three basis points of slippage that we saw in the second and third quarter were more like 3% or 4%, so the majority of that 6% in the fourth quarter. So it was a little bit higher there but also we are always talking about year over year, so just recall that. To the second half of your question, you are correct, it could come back quite quickly and in our modeling is likely to in the first and second quarter. So we will see a positive impact on that. The reason why I say that in the first quarter revenue is more likely to be close to underlying market growth is that even though we will start to get a positive inventory,  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll start to get the positive ASP benefit from business sales that I talked about, so that will still potentially be a slight negative, and that won\u2019t start coming back until let\u2019s say the first half of next year. Then you get into the first half of next year, you get the positive inventory impact because it will go back up and hopefully stay back up and you start to get the business cycle as well, so you start to get both of them being positive rather than offsetting. Does that make sense?\nJohn DiFuca: Yeah, it does. That\u2019s very helpful, thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.\nTim Klasell: Good afternoon, everybody. My question has to do with the Office 2010 launch and actually, I think you\u2019ve got the entire productivity stack launching next year. Can you sort of guide us through how you think that will affect revenues? Will there be a burst afterwards like we see in Windows 7 or can you help us sort of think about our models going into next year with the business division?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Given that it\u2019s going to launch in the fall of next year, I don\u2019t really see a significant impact in 2010 as a result of it. In fact, again, we could start to -- it could be a headwind for the first half, then start to turn around in the second half and you start to see a very good situation in terms of 2011, but if you\u2019re just trying to model 2010, it\u2019s not going to be a significant positive. It will certainly help in terms of annuity sale and help mitigate some of the negative transactional impacts that we are seeing, so some of the signing up annuities that I mentioned, people are looking forward to Office 2010, some of the new business that we are signing, as well as some of the other products that are coming up in that division, for example, SharePoint and Office Communication Server. So it will be a slow burn in terms of MBD. I think we\u2019ll see a more positive earlier trend than server and tools and client but MBD to my mind is pretty much a 2011 story, not a 2010.\nTim Klasell: Very good. Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: Good afternoon. Chris, you\u2019ve given a pretty tight range of guidance for operating expenditures for fiscal \u201910, especially give how much cost you took out in the back half of fiscal \u201909, I mean, I\u2019m struggling a little bit with -- I mean, is revenue going to grow next year and can you handicap why that range is so tight? What happens if revenue is significantly better or worse -- will it still stay there?\nChristopher P. Liddell: As I mentioned, we have a very -- what I described as a very tight rein on costs and I think you saw that in the performance this year. So I am feeling very good about the organization\u2019s ability to keep a tight control on costs across the board in terms of things like headcount, which we look at on a month-by-month basis, in terms of cost per head, salary increases, which are zero this year -- it\u2019s going to be hard to vary much from zero. Costs per head in terms of travel and entertainment, the things that we can control through a very good cost control mechanism, I think we have a good handle on and therefore I don\u2019t feel exposed in terms of it peaking or troughing much from it. In terms of some of the areas where we don\u2019t control our revenue driven expenses, you know, for example, money that we might pay our partners if they outperform on revenue, yes, those could go up and therefore that number could go outside that range as a result of that. I guess I would say if that\u2019s the case and revenue outperforms and it costs us a little bit more expense, it\u2019s probably a positive thing and we\u2019ll explain it at the time. But in terms of the great bulk of expenses which are very much around our people internally, I feel good that we have handle on those.\nKatherine Egbert: Okay, very good. Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my question. Chris, I have one platform related question -- as you know, Google announced the launch of Chrome OS for netbook in 2010. In your view, is there really a need for an OS that can handle online services and cloud client computing better than Windows and how do you think Microsoft is to respond to that kind of competitive move? Thank you.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure, I mean, we\u2019ve been fighting free OS in the client area for quite some time, as you all know, and I would point to the general value that we think Windows has and in particular around Windows 7, which we think is going to be our best ever operating system, and we still believe that the very, very, very large majority of people are going to want both a client and an Internet based experience on their PC, so of course people want to surf the Internet and access. They can do that quite freely with Windows and all the Internet Explorer and choices that they have, so a browser only based like software may have applicability as it does with Linux based systems already, but we don\u2019t see that significantly changing just because of Chrome OS coming out.\nBill Koefoed: All right, Operator, let\u2019s have one final question.\nOperator: The last question is from  Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Chris, I just wanted to get your thoughts as you look out here -- do you see much change from a geographic perspective? I mean, I would love to just get your thoughts from an economic perspective as you are looking out across the different geographies -- do you see much variance between North America, Europe, and maybe how we should think about that going from the first half to the second half of the year? Thanks.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure. If I cluster the areas into I guess four -- let\u2019s do it in four, which would be Europe, North America, Asia non-Japan, and Japan, I would say that we are most encouraged in Asia in general developed markets, so we are starting to see reasonable growth in those areas. Now, that tends to be our lowest ASP market, so it\u2019s not helping us enormously but nevertheless, when we look out, we would say that to the extent that there\u2019s a -- we come out of a global recession, those are the areas that are going to be the first to come out of it and we see positive growth. Next in line would be North America, which is still obviously very tough but relative to say Europe and Japan, is just looking in better shape and that\u2019s as much anecdotal as it is macroeconomic, just in terms of our sales force and talking to them and looking at our budgeting for next year. So I\u2019ve rank ordered them emerging markets, North America, and then right at the tail end, Western Europe and Japan.\nRobert Breza: Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft investor central website at www.microsoft.com/msft.

Our third quarter results reflect the combination of two forces, firstly the most difficult economic environment the company has faced in our 30 year history, about offset by company specific factors. On the macroeconomic front, we saw a broad-based slowdown across virtually all product lines and geographies. Our transactional revenues, for example, and our emerging markets, in particular, were impacted by the economic reset that we are all seeing with demand down as much as 15% to 20%. Against that backdrop, while I can't be happy with any quarter where our revenue and earnings per share decreased, I was actually pleased with our relative performance. First, our annuity licensing held up well, reflecting the strength of our diversified business model. Second, we managed expenses significantly below our expectations going into the quarter, which is a credit to our employees' ability to adapt to a new reality. And third, despite all the distractions, including the first significant layoffs the company has ever implemented, we executed on our product development milestones. Globally, overall IT spend, in particular, business hardware purchasing continued to slow from the levels seen in the second quarter and severely impacted transactional license sales in our client Microsoft business division and server and tools businesses. We did see some pockets of strength reflecting consumers' desire to purchase down the price points. For example, we saw healthy unit volumes at netbooks, office suites at retail and Xbox 360 consoles. Geographically mature markets slowed noticeably, while emerging markets, which has historically been sources of strong revenue growth for us reported even deeper declines than mature markets. Our annuity business is clearly our bright spot. With strong sales execution, corporate customers are renewing their long-term commitment with us, which reflects both the value of our current product portfolio and anticipated future product innovation. On the expense side, we executed against cost-saving initiatives with production down across the board, marketing, vendor costs, and other discretionary spend, as well as a reduction in headcount and headcount related costs, and lower capital expenditure. We ended the quarter with 800 less employees than we started the quarter with, and importantly, we're also seeing our people focus on efficiency and the need for fiscal discipline. We accomplished this while also focusing on operational excellence. This quarter, we made significant product development progress towards the next wave of product and services. Over the next 18 months, we will be delivering updates to our core franchises, namely Windows 7, Windows Server and Office 2010, as well as bringing new services like Windows Azure to market. So in summary, we remain cautious \u2013 more cautious than most about the state of the world economy. Our globally diversified business gives us insight into a world where economic pressures are both broad and deep. While we would all like to think that a recovery will be short and painless, we unfortunately believe that it'll be so and gradual. We expect trading conditions to remain very difficult through the next quarter and potentially through the balance of this calendar year. Against that backdrop, we have to focus on our relative performance. We have the benefit of a strong annuity business, which partially insulates us. We can continue to be tight on costs. We can continue to focus on maximizing the strongest cash flow of any company in the industry, and we will continue to launch a counter cyclical wave of products over the next 12 to 18 months, which will help growth in fiscal year 2010 and beyond. So with those high-level themes, I will turn the call over to Bill for some more details on the third quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks. As Chris mentioned, our revenue results were impacted by a weak macro economic environment. However, strong execution on our cost initiatives helped to offset the impact to operating income. I'm going to provide you with details on our financial performance. I'll start with the overall company business and financial momentum points and then follow up with revenue performance for each of the business units. All growth comparisons I mention relates to the comparable year of last year unless otherwise specified. Overall, revenue declined 6% to $13.6 billion, due to continued weakness in global demand, particularly in the business PC and server hardware market. Despite this revenue shortfall, excluding the $0.06 of charges related to severance and investment impairments, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.39, in line with expectations. Within the business results, the transactional portions of our business are down substantially as a result of weakness in the associated market while our annuity business remains healthy. Within our customer segment, small and mid market customers remain the most severely impacted by the current economic conditions. In the consumer segment, we have seen healthy volumes in the lower-priced products, but experienced weakness in the higher -priced SKUs as can be expected in this environment. The enterprise customer segment has held up and renewal rates were stable and within our historical range. Driven by these dynamics, our product billing mix continues to shift toward our annuity licensing, which is up five percentage points from the prior year to about 35%. The remaining billing mix is approximately 30% from OEMs, 15% from transactional license only sales, with the balance from our other businesses. Unearned revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Our contracted not billed balance exceeds $12.5 billion and was also up year-over-year. Overall, total bookings for the company declined 15% driven by the declines in the transactional portions of our business. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not materially impact overall revenue growth this quarter. Now let me move to the revenue and business drivers by segment beginning with Windows client. I will start with some commentary on the PC market. We saw continued deterioration in the overall PC hardware market, which we estimate to have declined 7% to 9%. Traditional or non-netbook PCs were down 15% to 17% compared with the year ago quarter. We have seen continued weakness in the business segment of the PC market as companies cut their IT hardware spending and extended hardware refresh cycles. The small notebook PCs or netbook category in the market continued its growth and represented about 10% of the total PC shipments for the quarter. Unit sales in the consumer segment of the market benefited from the growth in the netbook category and were about flat year-over-year. So with that market context, let me move on to client. Client revenue was $3.4 billion, down 16% from a year ago. This decline is consistent with the framework we provided to you last quarter with client revenue declining in line with the traditional portion of the PC hardware market. Overall OEM unit sales declined 6% performing slightly better than the overall PC market due to attach rate improvement. The particularly strong attach rate in netbooks illustrate that customers continue to prefer Windows. OEM revenue was down 19% driven by the dynamics in the underlying PC market. Specifically, sales of premium SKUs were down over 20%, primarily due to the declines in the traditional business PC market, I mentioned. Partially offsetting the decline in premium units was strong growth in our lower price netbook software. The commercial and retail portion of the client business grew 1%. The enterprise annuity business continued to have healthy growth. This growth was partially offset by lower retail sales attributable to general consumer spending softness, as well as some normal slowing ahead of a major product release. Against the current economic backdrop, the client revenue remained \u2013 the client division remained focused on execution and delivering on the product pipeline. During the quarter, we released the public beta of Windows 7. We feel very good about the response we are getting to Windows 7 beta testers and our progress against the next milestone, which is the release candidate. We also delivered significant innovations to the browser with the release of Internet Explorer 8, which has also received strong press and analyst reviews. We remain very positive about the client product pipeline and its ability to drive long-term growth for the company. On the marketing side, we have seen a measurable perception increase for Windows from our recent advertising campaigns. Specifically, our research shows that 10% increase in preference for Windows PC since these campaigns launched. Now let us move to server and tools where revenues grew 7% to $3.5 billion. Revenue was driven by double-digit growth in our enterprise annuity business from sales of premium editions of Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 in addition to strong growth in System Center Management suite. The consulting and support services portion of server and tools revenue grew 6%. Revenue from the transactional and OEM portions of the business declined over 15% during the quarter in line with the estimates for the underlying x86 server hardware market. Industry analysts continue to publish healthy market share performance for Windows Server 2008, a validation of the competitive benefit it provides the customers. On the product front, the server and tools division delivered the beta release of Windows Server 2008 R2, which builds on the value of Windows server, with new features like live migration. In addition, we released the beta version of Silverlight 3, which delivers new functionality to run Silverlight applications off-line. Moving on to the online services business, revenue declined $122 million or 14%. Online advertising revenue was down 16% primarily due to the significant decline in display advertising rates across the industry. Partially offsetting this was continued growth in both page views and search queries. The Microsoft business division had revenues of $4.5 billion, which declined 5% due to declines in non-annuity licensing. This transactional revenue was primarily impacted by the traditional PC market decline. We increased attach with pricing promotion, but due to lower prices and PC sales, overall transactional revenue declined more than 25%. This decline was partially offset by healthy 15% revenue growth from our annuity business. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand in our SharePoint, Office Communications Server and CRM products, which all grew more than 20%. On the product front, during the quarter, we released a new version of our unified communications offering, with Office Communications Server 2007 R2. Additionally, last week, we announced the timeline for our next release of Office 2010 and made available the beta version of Exchange 2010, which will be for sale in the second half of calendar 2009. Moving to the entertainment devices division, revenue decreased 2% to $1.6 billion. The Xbox 360 business had a very strong quarter selling over 1.7 million consoles. This represents growth of almost 30% over the prior year. This fiscal year to date, we have already sold approximately 10 million consoles, about 15% more than we sold in all of last year. Attach rates for Xbox continue to lead the industry with software attach rates growing to 8.3 and accessories attach rates growing to 3.9. In addition, Xbox Live is a key differentiator for our platform. For example, 1 million Xbox Live gold members have activated Netflix on Xbox Live. You'll hear more about our Xbox Live progress at E3 in June. During the quarter, we unveiled Windows Mobile 6.5, the next version of our Windows Mobile software platform. You can expect to see phones running Windows Mobile 6.5 by the fourth quarter of this calendar year. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of revenue increased 12% primarily driven by increased distribution and data center costs. Operating expenses decreased $1.3 billion or 16%. This year's results were impacted by $290 million of employee severance charges, as a result of our announced plan to eliminate up to 5,000 positions. Prior year's results included $1.4 million in certain legal charges. Adjusting for these items, operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, due to our focus on efficiency that Chris described earlier. Operating income of $4.4 billion was up 3% but down 17% after adjusting for impacts of the employees' severance and legal charges from the current and prior years. Other income and expense was a net loss of $388 million and includes $420 million of impairment charges on investments, primary due to the continued declines in the market. Given the uncertainty and volatility of marketing conditions, we remain focused on cash and working capital management. The company generated $5.4 billion or $0.61 per share in free cash flow this quarter, reflecting moderated operating expenses and capital expenditures. We have maintained our AAA debt rating and rebuild cash to over $25 billion while returning $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends. Our effective tax rate was 26.5% for the quarter in line with guidance we provided. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 6% from the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, excluding the severance and impairment charges of $0.06, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.39, meeting expectations. So in summary, we remain focused in the areas we can control and in the third control delivered meaningful cost savings and significant progress on our product pipeline. With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with more insight into our business outlook.\nChris Liddell: Thanks. For the remainder of the call, I will speak to our broad expectations for the fourth quarter and our preliminary view of fiscal year 2010. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, we witnessed deterioration of spending levels through the third quarter as macro factors pressured hardware market's IT budgets and advertisement spend. In the fourth quarter, we expect the overall spending environment to remain difficult. Given the numerous underlying trends though, rather than providing a static quantitative revenue and earnings per share guidance, we recommend that you look at the market drivers of our business using the following framework. In the client business, PC shipments remained the primary driver of revenue, and we expect traditional PC shipments, both excluding netbooks to remain weak. In the fourth quarter, we expect client revenue to be in line with or slightly below the growth rate in the traditional PC market, based on a year ago comparable which had higher than normal levels of inventory at OEM and at retail, and continued weakness of business PC demand, which has a higher associated selling price. We expect the netbooks mix of total PCs to follow the trends seem in Q3. In the Microsoft business division, traditional consumer and business PC shipments remained the primary drivers of approximately 40% of the segment's revenue, which is transactional in nature. This revenue is the most susceptible to the volatile market conditions. In the fourth quarter, we expect this part of the revenue to lag traditional PC shipments by several points, the result of general purchasing power weakness from small and mid market customers, and continued inventory contraction and retail and our OEMs. The remaining 60% of MBD revenue is from annuity licensing, which is being supported by the strength of new growth businesses like SharePoint and unified communications. In the fourth quarter, we expect positive annuity growth of single digits, slightly ahead of overall IT spend. The pipeline for annuity contracts in the fourth quarter includes a large renewal wave, which we are optimistic on closing given our year-to-date performance, but there are clearly risks from lengthening sales cycles. Like MBD, the server and tools segment includes both transactional and annuity licensing components. We expect the transactional portion of the business, which is about 30% of the total, to generally align to the server hardware market. Third-party analysts expect both server hardware shipments to be consistent with the third quarter and therefore remain weak. The remaining annuity licensing and enterprise services portion of the server and tools segment will trend towards overall IT spend. Our OSB revenue, excluding our legacy Access business, should mirror the online advertising spending market. Volume should continue to increase but monetization rates, in particular, the display advertising portion of our business will remain under pressure. The entertainment devices division primary driver remains consumer sentiment and spending. Our overall market position and volume remains very good, but console revenue, representing 30% of the segment should decline in the fourth quarter as a result of our earlier pricing actions and a mix shift to lower priced consoles. Console attach rate of revenue representing another 30% of revenue should benefit on a year-over-year basis from the increased install base of consoles, partially offset by moderating attach rates. The other non-gaming portions of the business should be impacted by the underlying PC market and overall consumer spending behavior. In summary, the transactional, consumers and advertising revenue will remain under significant pressure until market conditions improve, offset by annuity revenue, which will start to converge with, but still outperform overall IT spend. With those things on revenue, I will turn to our expectations of fourth quarter operating expenses. Given the progress made on cost reductions in the third quarter, we're further reducing our full year operating expense guidance by up to $1 billion from the guidance we provided to you last quarter of $27.4 billion. This is on top of the $1.5 billion decrease we forecast in our January call, so it totals up to $2.5 billion of savings from our original July guidance last year. We now expect fiscal 2009 operating expenses to be between $26.7 billion and $26.9 billion. This forecast includes the $290 million severance charges, which were not in the prior forecast. We also now expect capital expenditure to come in at $3.1 billion, an additional $200 million below our January guidance, and some $900 million lower than our expectations at the beginning of the year. Moving to the other drivers of earnings per share, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the fourth quarter. Other income will be largely dependent on market movements. So I would like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal year 2010. Our planning expectation is that macro conditions remain very challenging through the remainder of this 2009 calendar year, which covers the first half of our fiscal year. Third-party analysts generally expect continued decline in the demand for PC and server hardware, which as I told earlier, will likely impact the non-annuity components of our Microsoft business division, client and server and tools segments. Growth in the annuity portions of our business should still outperform non-annuity or moderate reflecting the lower growth rate in bookings. We expect the volatility seen in emerging markets to continue. In calendar year 2010, there is some potential for market conditions to improve, but it is clearly too soon to call. Many third-party economists are predicting the re-emergence of GDP growth, which should favorably impact IT spend, hardware markets and advertising spend. We will also begin to benefit from favorable year over year comparables in the second half of fiscal 2010. And finally, we will begin to see the impact from the next wave of new products coming to market. As to COGS, cost of goods sold, next year, we should expect to continued growth driven by increasing costs and the distribution deals we signed in fiscal year 2009 ramp and more of our business goes towards the software plus services model. In January, we shared with you a preliminary estimate for operating expenses in fiscal year 2010 of $27.4 billion. We are currently in the process of finalizing next year's budget, and while we are looking for additional opportunities to save, we will provide you with an updated view of fiscal year 2010 operating expense in July. The headcount, as I mentioned in last quarter's call, we are committed to eliminating 5,000 positions by July 2010. In addition, we said we would make cuts in our cost of goods sold stopping. We're making progress on that plan and remain committed to implementing it as soon as practical. As we also said in January, we will add 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs in new high-growth areas over the next 18 months. The vast majority of these will be US workers, but we are also committed to hiring the best employees from around the world. So we will continue our Visa program, albeit at a lower rate, with overall applications for H1B Visas down from 20% and new hire Visas down 40%. Cash maximization will continue to be a focus area in fiscal year 2010, given our view of the economy. We are fortunate to have a business model that is exceptionally strong in cash generation. Despite the turbulent economic conditions, we are generating net cash flow from operations at an annualized rate of approximately $20 billion. We expect free cash flow to continue to exceed operating income, and this will be assisted by significantly lower CapEx spending in fiscal year 2010. Capital expenditures are expected to decrease from the $3.1 billion I mentioned earlier this fiscal year to approximately $2 billion next year. We are very vigilant on customer credit issues and to date have had an extremely good collection experience. Finally, we remain committed on returning capital to shareholders, and while stock repurchases will vary from quarter to quarter, we remain a net purchaser of stock over the long-term and a committed payer of dividends. So in summary, it was a tough quarter, but I'm pleased with the organization's response by managing costs and executing on our product portfolio. Over the next 18 months, we were bringing a large wave of products and services to market, and as such, while on the short-term, our results will be impacted by the current economic conditions, we believe the long-term outlook for technology and our relative position remains very strong. So with those comments, what I am going to do is hand it back to Bill and very happy to take your questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Chris. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid lengthy and multipart questions, and I will strictly limit you to just one question. Barb, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Hi. Good afternoon guys. Chris, just to follow up on your COGS comment before, you said \u2013 I believe you said we should expect to see continued growth given the deals signed in fiscal year 2009 ramp. I'm just trying to get a sense, should we expect the \u2013 I mean gross margins I think were a little bit disappointing to people this quarter. I thought that was an area where Steve mentioned at the event that you could actually expect to get a little bit of an improvement there. So\u2026\nChris Liddell: Yes, Heather. We are \u2013 relative to Steve's comment, we are looking for opportunities to make efficiency savings in that area, and in fact we have got a task force looking at that over the next quarter. Having said that, that efficiency is against a generally increasing trend as the mix of business shifts in that direction. So we have clearly been making some fairly significant investments in our data center, infrastructure, as we shift to a more online business and more software services. So that will start to flow through in terms of depreciation. And we will also be making some distribution transactions we've announced. So you'll start to see the costs\u2026\nHeather Bellini: So it is going to start growing faster than \u2013 it is going to be growing still faster than sales?\nChris Liddell: Yes. I would think in particular in this environment because we're going to see a relatively subdued environment certainly for the first half of the fiscal year. So yes, you can assume that is the case.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Heather. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. I had a question about the client commentary heading into the fourth quarter. I believe you mentioned that we should expect units and revenue to be in line maybe with revenue a little bit below unit. And I guess I was wondering, given that the delta in this quarter between licensing and units being pretty wide, should we expect to see that similar kind of delta as average selling prices are under pressure, do you expect that to close as we get into the quarter? And then just as we look a little bit further towards Window 7, what would you expect to see with the commercial and retail licensing business as we get a little bit closer to the release? I would think it would probably drop off. Thanks.\nChris Liddell: Yes. Thanks Adam. Good point. In quarter four, I would say you're going to see broadly the same trends as we saw in Q3. I mean the introduction of netbooks makes it difficult for us to do our normal walk-through of units and revenue, but the rule of thumb that we gave you last quarter is, if you look at the non-netbooks growth, or in this case decline, that would broadly approximate the revenue in the client business. So the negatives we're seeing on our ASP will be made up for the positives that we get from netbooks growth. I think that's a reasonable rule of thumb going forward, the same sort of trends we will see in terms of lower ASPs, netbook growth you can expect to see. The only thing that you I think we will see in the fourth quarter, that is probably slightly different from the third quarter, is a continued pressure on the business segment, which is the Pro, which is their highest revenue generator. So we might see a little bit of a gap there. And also in the finished goods area, which you asked about for fiscal year 2010, will just start with the fourth quarter. I think that will be a tough comparable because we had a good very good performance in the fourth quarter of last year. So that might be a \u2013 that my drag the overall growth rate down, attach as well. Going into next year then the finished goods area, in particular, FPP in the second half of the year when we start to see the Windows 7 impact, that will start to look more favorable. So we're going to see a declining trend for a while, improving as we get to the back end of next fiscal year.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Adam.\nAdam Holt: Terrific, thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Hi guys. How are you?\nChris Liddell: Good, thank you.\nBrad Reback: Chris, you had talked about annuity rates, renewal rates being pretty stable over the course of the quarter and the expectation that they remain that way. Could you give us any sense of what pricing trends look like and what you might expect them to be for the remainder of the fiscal year?\nChris Liddell: Yes. The first comment I will make is that the third quarter was a relatively quiet quarter for us, fourth quarter is a very big quarter. So this will be an important quarter for us in terms of renewals and that will feed through what happens in fiscal year 2010. The experience to date is that we have seen no \u2013 what we discovered is no unnatural discounting. We've certainly seen customers being very price conscious, but to date our renewals have been broadly in line with the revenue that is falling off from previous contracts being revenue renewed at about the same rate. Now what we're losing is perhaps some of the upside that we saw in previous years, so typically when we renew a contract, we take the opportunity to up sales, put some of the new products into the mix. Hopefully for most customers, we are seeing them with more seats at the end of three years than they started that with, more employees. Clearly that trend is more difficult, so we're seeing customers with the same or even less employees than where they were three years ago. And while we should be offering them new products, we might be losing some, picking up something from the new products, so overall awash. The general sort of environment that we're seeing is good renewal rates, no unnatural price discounting, but we have lost some of the upside, so therefore our renewals and our billing is sort of trending down to low single digits from the sort of mid double digits that we are experiencing in the last years. So still overall what I would describe particularly in this environment as very healthy, but not sort of double digit rates we would have loved to have seen.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: And next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Hi guys. Just wanted to dig into cost of goods sold just a little bit for the count down next year, just wondering if you can give us a sense of quarter to quarter there, just what your expectations are? And that is it.\nChris Liddell: Yes sure. We're not giving out guidance on cost of goods sold. We will certainly give you some more color in July. But if you see the trends that have been happening in the last few quarters and extrapolate those, you can expect that to continue. Now you have to look a little bit deep into the underlying trend. So for example we have hardware cost of goods sold, they tend to move very much with Xbox sales, so that is one dynamic. Then you have the online cost of goods sold and that tending to go up as we depreciate some of the infrastructure we have put in that tends to follow the capital expenditure that we have been talking about over the last couple of years. And then you have got sort of general cost of goods sold and things like distribution deals which is starting to ramp up with the announcements that we have made over the last few months. So if we take these three trends and combine them together and extrapolate them, you get some sense of what fiscal year 2010 will look like.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next is Brendan Barnicle with Pacific crest.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks so much. Chris, as you start to think about Windows 7 and how that may be released and we start to think about modeling that, should we look at that to have the same sort of tech guarantee program that we had with Vista and as a result that same impact on deferred revenue, or would there be any change, maybe more like was done in earlier OS releases?\nChris Liddell: Yes. We obviously haven't finalized all of those details. It is not unreasonable to assume that we would do a tech guarantee at some stage, but the exact timing of that will depend on clearly the release time of the product itself, and that could cause some inter-quarter accounting recognition issues, but not a significant issue. Obviously it will washout over the course of the year. So yes, you can assume that from a modeling point of view. I you're looking over the long-term, it won't have any impact.\nBrendan Barnicle: Might it be \u2013 see its effect in the shorter period than we saw with Vista?\nChris Liddell: Too early to tell. I think that a similar period is how I would assume.\nBrendan Barnicle: Okay great. Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Good afternoon. Chris, if I could just take you back more to kind of a macro view, feel like you have given us more color than last quarter. Is there anything in the linearity of the quarter that made you feel a little bit better as you got towards the end of March? And in particular, if I kind of think of even just the guidance you have given us, you have clearly given us a lot more color this time around than you give us back in January. But it feels like you're signaling that maybe you still have your arms around it better, is that fair or unfair way to think about it?\nChris Liddell: A couple of comments. Firstly, this is the quarter we typically start to talk about fiscal year 2010, so I'm giving you a little bit more color, because I'm trying to give you some sense of the fiscal year the next year as opposed to what is just happening for the next quarter, so you are picking up that. The second, in terms of linearity, I guess (inaudible) learning things like second derivative, and what they mean. How do I feel about the shape of the quarter? I don't see any improvement at the end of the quarter that gives me encouragement that we are at the bottom and coming out of it. I think \u2013 I would like to think that trading conditions will not get any worse than where they were in the third quarter, but hopefully my commentary gives you some sense that we expect them to continue in the fourth quarter and second half of the year, a little bit early to tell, but probably continue to be tough as well. So if you like, during the quarter, they stopped getting worse, but that is different from they started getting better.\nSarah Friar: Sure.\nChris Liddell: And I think that's a safe assumption for the fourth quarter.\nSarah Friar: And US versus Europe, just the two very major geographies, any particular differences between the two?\nChris Liddell: Not between US and Europe, Western Europe anyway. Eastern Europe very weak, places like Russia, particularly weak. Japan, very weak; Brazil, very weak. So some of the areas where a year ago we were talking about extremely good growth rates, countries like Russia, particularly had extremely good growth rates a year ago, have gone the other way. So the US and Western Europe, very similar picture, weak, but not significantly. When you go into Eastern Europe and emerging markets, the picture is generally worse.\nSarah Friar: Okay, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: And next is John DiFucci with JP Morgan.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Chris, last quarter you said that clients saw 2% headwind because the channel inventories were below normal levels, and it looks like the OEM license G&A growth was about 2% better than PC unit growth. I'm just curious is that all \u2013 is that all inventory making up for the inventory of last channel, and where is the industry today, or is there something else happening there also?\nChris Liddell: It is a combination of factors. Inventory is one of them; attach rates were actually quite good in the quarter, so not only because of the netbooks impact. We have an exceptionally high netbooks attach now, about 90%, I believe. But we also saw good attach in the non netbook segment as well, so there's a few variables moving there, inventory being one of them, I think was a slight negative, to be honest, inventory but attach rate was particularly positive, and that led the impact that you are seeing.\nBill Koefoed: Operator?\nChris Liddell: Sorry? Yes.\nJohn DiFucci: So the \u2013 just to be clear there, so inventory has the 2% headwind last quarter and you saw another small headwind again this quarter as inventory levels actually got a little lower?\nChris Liddell: Correct.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay, thanks Chris.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: And next is Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Chris, your expense controls are significantly ahead of your plan you just gave just two months ago. How do you think about the next phase of expense control, and I know you mentioned you are not going to give 2010 guidance? But I think the way you guys mentioned, to think about it is that would be flat in 2009 with 2010, so I think we are assuming that that number that you have given us now is flat for 2010? Can you just help us clarify if there is anything else that you plan to spend ahead of some of these major launches that would change that trajectory that you just give us two months ago?\nChris Liddell: Let me give you a bit of overall context about how I think about the savings in general and then I can answer your question specifically. I think you've probably heard me say that in this company and in the previous companies I've worked, I've always felt that the best cost savings programs are ones that are a combination of, I describe, a top-down and bottom-up. Top-down being basically, we're going to cut headcount by X, we're going to cut travel expenditure by Y, and these are the new rules. The bottom-up is how then employees actually apply those rules to how they run the business. Now when I give you the numbers a couple of months, three months ago effectively, for this year, that was the sum total of our top-down initiatives. So if employees implemented them exactly how \u2013 implemented the rules exactly how we told them, effectively you would have had that number. The fact that we have been able to achieve operating expense savings in excess of that is really a credit to people implementing in an even more extreme fashion. So they have even traveled even less than what we have asked them to, they have taken \u2013 been doing cost savings even more than what we have asked them, and we have ramped headcount even slower than what we were anticipating. So I don't bank the bottom-up on a continual basis. I only bank what I describe as the top-down, so my starting position for fiscal year 2010 remains where it was, in dollar terms, a quarter ago. Having said that, if we get a cultural change and employees continue to have fiscal responsibility and implement the rules in a very efficient fashion, then we could see a lower number. So I'm not going to promise that to you this quarter. There will be part of what we do in the budgeting round, but I would be starting next year with the number I gave last quarter, and hopefully we can beat that when we talk to you about it in three months time.\nBrent Thill: Thanks Chris.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: And next is Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.\nTim Klasell: Yes, good afternoon everybody. Just wanted to go over to the Microsoft business division where you said on Office you had a higher tax rate but lower ASPs and lower units. Is that lower unit \u2013 excuse me, lower ASP and higher tax rate going to be something you want to do prominently, i.e. if units begin to pick back up, we can model it like that, or do you think we might see the ASPs begin to increase after the release of the next version or if the economy gets better?\nChris Liddell: There was two impacts last quarter that hit ASP and what (inaudible) talked about how you expect them going forward. The first was that we just had a price decrease. We took the opportunity to have a special price. We will \u2013 and that certainly we got a volume pickup as a result of that but a lower ASP. You won't see that as a permanent basis, that was something that we did for a quarter or so. That was one thing. The second was that we generally saw a continued buying activity in the lower price points and less buying activity in the high price points because of the worse business PC growth. So if you like, you saw a mix change to a lower SKU. Again that is really going to be driven in the future by not our action, but by how PCs, business PCs recovered through next year. I think it is going to continue to be relatively weak for the foreseeable future, and I think I foreshadowed that in my overall comment. Going into the releases the next calendar year, I would like to think that business PC demand is hopefully going to be picking back up by then, plus we'll have the new release. So you'll start to see that trend come back the other way, but it is going to be some time.\nTim Klasell: Okay great. Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nOperator: And next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Chris, you made a comment earlier that you are looking forward to launching a counter cyclical wave of products in the next 18 to 24 months. I was wondering if you could expand upon that and also talk about, to the extent that you can on a quarterly earnings conference call, what kind of changes we should anticipate to the business model (inaudible) associated with that? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: Sure. I mean \u2013 it is difficult launching a massive wave of products into a weakening demand, so that is what I've described as the counter cyclical. But when you look across virtually all of our businesses, there is going to be a major release of some form of them in the next year, the most obvious is Windows 7 clearly which has been well foreshadowed. Office will be coming out with a new version, Exchange will be coming out with a new version. We have got potentially a new search product coming out in the foreseeable future. So you will see, in all of our major products, a significant release in the next let's say 12 months. Now that is going to be into a soft demand environment potentially, but we think that is really the right thing to do. And clearly that is an investment that is driven around our product development portfolio, not the economic cycle. But once we start to get economic pickup, we think that we will outperform that economic pickup. So the moment it is really about the surviving the economic reset, going into a growth period, which we like to think is going to be around the corner at some stage. We will actually be going into that growth pickup with a very, very good set of new products, and so the environment, one to two years out, starts to look much more interesting.\nKash Rangan: And also Chris, the business model changes associated with that product rollout?\nChris Liddell: Well, the ones that I meant, and why it would be a significant business model are the ones that you will see, the Windows Azure also will be generally released over that period. So that will start to change the business model. You'll start to see more online driven version of some of our key products, so that will start to change the business model. But the revenue impacts of that are going to be relatively modest, certainly in fiscal year 2010. That is more of a fiscal year 2011 and 2012 impact in terms of significance.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question?\nBill Koefoed: And next is Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, just a follow up to Sarah's question about the geographic weakness that you mentioned in some of those countries, are you specifically talking about the transaction business, the annuity business or both, kind of follow up on that? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: Yes, I tend to look at the transactional business because it is probably more of an indicator of the instantaneous economic activity in that particular country, although the blended rate is also the same basic trend. But my comments were in particular around transactional. So you tend to obviously see in countries like Russia, it is more driven around transactional anyway. There isn't a strong enterprise agreement driven part of that economy yet. So the transactional tends to be a higher component and particularly when [ph] I was mentioning countries, I was thinking about that.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, let us take one more question.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: Thanks. Chris, you didn't repurchase any stock this quarter. Can you talk about that, you approach to capital? I mean is this environment driven or is there another reason? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: It is generally environmental. I put that \u2013 foreshadowed that at the last call that we would be generally more cautious in this current environment in terms of building our cash reserves. I am happy on the flip side to lower share repurchases. We have built cash and investments back over $25 billion. So we have purchased back around $9 billion of stock this fiscal year and paid out around $3 billion of dividends. So we have returned about $12 billion. Going forward, as I think I have said consistently, we still will be a net purchaser of our shares. We are still committed to paying dividends. So we are still committed to repaying cash as much as possible, but it is going to vary quarter by quarter, and is going depend enormously on the environment we find ourselves in, and things like our working capital management as well. But overall one of the great positives of the company, which I mentioned briefly in my prepared remarks, is just the overall cash flow. We are generating free cash flow at around $20 billion annualized rate, which is tremendous in this environment. So there is no reason to suspect that over the medium to long-term we won't continue to be net buyers of our shares.\nKatherine Egbert: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Okay. So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft Investor Central website at www.microsoft.com/msft. Again thanks for joining us and have a good day.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call.

Our second-quarter results reflect a difficult environment as the global economy continued to deteriorate beyond our expectations, particularly during the month of December. Despite this economic backdrop, we were able to grow revenue and utilize accelerated cost reductions to offset the majority of the impact of the revenue shortfall on operating income. On a segment basis, our client business, being the most severely impacted by the softening economy, declining 8% due to the significant weakness in the traditional PC market sales, partially offset by the rapid growth of netbooks. Revenue from Microsoft business division and server and tools divisions grew a combined $500 million or 7% driven by healthy demand from enterprise customers while the transactional aspects of these businesses were impacted by lower PC and server hardware unit sales. Our online services business revenue was flat, although online advertising revenue was up 7% in a tough environment. And entertainment and devices division delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance driven by a record number of consumers purchasing Xbox 360 consoles during the holiday season. Against the backdrop of a deteriorating economy, we are focused on the need for fiscal discipline and on executing in the areas we can control by managing expenses while delivering on the next wave of our product pipeline. During the second quarter, as the economic outlook continued to slow, we accelerated our expense reduction plan. These actions allowed us to deliver operating expenses in the second quarter $600 million below our October forecast. However, today we have also announced steps we will take to further manage our cost structure. These steps include a reduction in headcount related costs, including plans to reduce up to 5,000 positions in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 are effective today. There will be no pay raises next fiscal year. We have plans to significantly reduce our vendor and contingent staff expenses. We\u2019ll also be looking for reductions in marketing expenses, reduced capital expenditure and facility costs, as well as tighter discretionary spending, including significantly reduced travel related expenses. The cumulative result of these actions taken during the quarter and those announced today will result in operating expense savings of $1.5 billion and capital expenditure savings of $700 million lower in this fiscal year 2009 than assumed in our July guidance. Lastly, we plan to manage operating expenses broadly flat in the fiscal year 2010 and capital expenditure to be lower year over year. While we are managing our expenses tightly, we continue investing in key strategic opportunities which will fuel the future growth of the company. We have a strong product pipeline and are bringing to market a number of significant product releases over the next two calendar years. With those high level themes, I will turn the call over to Bill for more details on the second quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Chris. I will discuss top line financial and business momentum points followed by revenue performance for each of the business units. Then I\u2019ll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise noted. Revenue grew 2% to $16.6 billion, which was below our low end guidance as the economic environment weakened further than we expected, particularly in the month of December. Our mix of product billings was approximately 30% from OEMs, 25% from multi-year licensing agreements, 20% from license only sales, and the balance from our other businesses. Despite the broad economic weakness, the annuity portion of our volume licensing business remains healthy and increased one percentage point in our billing mix. Enterprise agreements renewal rates were in line with historical trends. Unearned revenue grew over 7% to $13.1 billion but was down sequentially. Our contracted not billed balance increased 10% year over year but was slightly down on a sequential basis remaining at over $13 billion. When taken together with reported revenues, total bookings for the company declined 10% this quarter, reflecting the general economic weakness, primarily in our non-annuity business. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about 1 percentage point to our revenue growth. Now I\u2019ll provide revenue details by business segment starting with Windows clients. Client revenue declined 8% to $4.0 billion. I will review the main drivers that contributed to this performance beginning with an overview of the PC market. We estimate that the PC market for the quarter was approximately flat year over year, well short of our forecast of 10% to 12% growth as the PC market weakened much more quickly and severely than expected. Adding a bit more color, traditional PCs declined almost 10% with weakness in both consumer and business PCs. This was partially offset by incremental growth in the new notebooks category. During the quarter, our Windows OEM licensed units declined by 1%. OEM revenue was 12% lower year over year driven primarily by the dynamics of the underlying PC market. Specifically, the decline in traditional PC sales drove double digit declines in business and consumer premium SKUs. This impact was partially offset by strong growth in our notebooks offering. Our attach rates were under pressure during the quarter, but we didn\u2019t experience a material change versus historical rate. Our notebook attach rate now exceed 80% as customers are clearly opting for the value Windows provides. We estimate that we lost about two percentage points of growth due to the channel holding lower than historical level of inventory. The commercial and retail portion of the client business grew 19% as it benefited from continued adoption of Windows Vista in the enterprise. On the product front, our engineering team reached a major milestone with the delivery of the public beta of Windows 7, which has received great reviews to-date. We remain very positive about the client product pipeline and its ability to drive long-term growth. Server and tools revenue grew 15% to $3.7 billion despite a declining server hardware market. This achievement marks the business' 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Annuity licensing continued to grow faster than non annuity licensing. The momentum of SQL Server 2008 and our Hyper-V virtualization helped drive Windows server sales and increase our systems center management tools attach rate, thus allowing us to grow our revenue per server. As a result, server and tools continued to grow faster than the hardware market. Demand for our consulting and support services to deploy Microsoft technology remained strong, driving revenue growth at 16%. On the product side, the server and tools division made significant product development progress. Released to beta, Windows Server 2008 R2 will add the Live migration feature to Hyper-V, further enhancing our virtualization offering. At the Professional Developers Conference in October, we provided a preview to Windows Azure, our cloud based services platform. The Azure services platform hosted in Microsoft data centers provides an operating system and a set of developer services that can be used to build new applications to run from the cloud or enhance existing applications with cloud based capabilities. This architecture gives developers the choice to build web applications, applications running on connected devices, PCs, servers or hybrid solutions, while using the same tools they use today. The online services business revenue was relatively flat at $866 million. Online advertising revenue grew 7%. Search revenue grew double digits while display revenue grew slower in a weak ad spending market. We continue to see healthy growth in our traffic with page views and query searches both up on a sequential and year over year basis. In the online services business, we recently announced important partnerships with Dell, Verizon, and Sun Microsystems, and released a new suite of Windows Live services. We remain committed to the benefit that a strong online services business will bring to Microsoft. Microsoft business division revenue was up 1% to $4.9 billion. Business revenue grew 7%, driven by continued strength of the annuity business across Office, SharePoint and Client Access licenses suites, and benefited from strong deferred revenue recognition. Non annuity revenue declined on weakness in the mid market, small medium business and consumer segments. Specifically consumer revenue declined 23% driven by the weakness in the core PC market, a mix shift to lower price SKUs and inventory reductions from Q1. From a product perspective, SharePoint, Office Communication Server and CRM, all grew at double-digit rates. We made significant progress against the product pipeline by releasing final versions of Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. In October at PDC, we demonstrated our Office 14 Web applications, which will enable the rich and familiar office experiences through the browser. Entertainment and devices division revenue grew 3% to $3.2 billion, a record 6 million consoles were sold in the quarter growing over 41%. In Europe, Xbox 360 sales nearly doubled those of previous holiday season. Based on US NPD numbers released last week, Xbox 360 outsold PS3 two one. We continue to lead the industry with our software attach ratio of 8.1. During the quarter, we also launched the new Xbox Experience, which has been received extremely well. This software update has given our customers a new upgraded experience that broadens its appeal and increases the value and durability of the platform to customers and Microsoft. Xbox Live membership has grown 70% from last year to 17 million members. Now, for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was $3.9 billion, increasing as a percentage of revenue two percentage points to 23.5%. Cost of goods sold growth was driven by higher Xbox 360 console volumes, increased data center and traffic acquisition cost in the online services business and growth in enterprise services. Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, over $600 million less than was assumed in our low end guidance. This represents a significant slowing in the operating expense growth rate. Savings included marketing, vendor, people and general and administrative expenses. As a consequence, operating income, which was $5.9 billion was only $174 million below guidance despite revenue being $712 million below guidance. Other income and expenses was a loss of approximately $300 million for the quarter, driven by currency evaluation declines on unhedged portions of the balance sheet and investment impairments, offset by dividends, interest and net recognized gains on investments sold. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, half a percentage point lower than guidance, driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. During the quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares or over $2.2 billion of company stock. We also paid out about $1.2 billion in dividend to shareholders. Diluted shares outstanding were 8.9 billion, down 6.2% from the prior year as a result of the share repurchases. Earnings per share were $0.47 representing a decline of 6%. As Chris noted earlier, the business environment made for a challenging quarter, but we feel positively about our quick response in managing expenses to mitigate the impact as much as possible. With that, let me turn it back to Chris, who will provide you with more insight into our business outlook.\nChris Liddell: I am going to spend my remaining time talking about the balance of fiscal 2009. Clearly, the volatility in the macro economic climate created a great degree of uncertainty in the second half of our fiscal year. And in particular conditions progressively worsened throughout the second quarter, creating a broader the normal range of possible extrapolations looking forward. So given that we expect macroeconomic conditions to be the most important variable in predicting our results in the second half, we\u2019re not providing quantitative revenue or earnings per share guidance at this time. We will however provide you with a framework to help you think about the drivers for our business. I\u2019ll start with revenue, beginning with clients. The PC market is clearly the key driver of client revenue and it is likely to remain weak over the second half of our fiscal year, with market trends similar to or potentially weaker than the second quarter, especially in the traditional PC market, excluding the Xbox. Offsetting that partially, the netbooks mix of total PCs will likely follow similar trends to Q2, with continued strong Windows attach on netbooks contributing to overall Windows revenue. However, as the economy slows, continued inventory contraction and pressure on tax rate would negatively impact revenue growth in the second half. So overall, we expect client revenue to perform broadly in line with the traditional PC market. For the Microsoft business division, I will speak to the three main drivers for the business. Consumer revenue, which makes up about 20% of the divisional revenue, will be impacted by the declines of the traditional or non netbook PC market, in addition to further channel inventory contraction. Transactional licensing sales to business customers which make up about 25% of the divisional revenue should generally align to the business PC hardware markets which may continue to decline in the second half. Finally, the remaining annuity licensing portion of MBD revenue which makes up approximately 55% is likely to remain somewhat insulated from macro trends and grow faster than IT spending due to the strength of the businesses like SharePoint and unified communications, although it could face pressure due to lengthening sales cycles. The server and tools segment has many of the same drivers as the business division. The OEM and transactional licensing to business customers, which is approximately 35% of the business, should generally align for the server hardware market which at this time of the year [ph] and we expect will decline over the second half of the year. The remaining annuity licensing and enterprise services portion of the business will likely continue to grow faster than IT spending based on the strength of our product portfolio and business model but also could face some pressure due to lengthening sales cycle. Overseas revenue should followed similar trends to what was experienced in the second quarter, as advertising spending will likely remain weak until the economy starts turning. This is particularly true for the display advertising portion of our business where we expect monetization rates across the industry to continue to worsen. Also keep in mind that ongoing expected declines is our XS business will weigh on the overall growth of the segment. Additionally, we would expect a headwind from the impact of foreign currency in the second half of the year, given the high proportion of revenue that comes from international markets. The entertainment and devices division is highly dependent on consumer spending and while we feel good about the first half results, a shrinking consumer spending environment would weigh on the segment's results in the second half. Console revenue will likely decline as a result of our earlier pricing actions. Attach revenue may also slow due to contracting consumer spending and moderating attach rates. The other software and peripherals portions of our business followed the underlying PC market in the second half. With that primarily to assist [ph] our revenue prospects, let me move to our outlook on expenses. The economy has clearly deteriorated more than we expected and we have responded to this environment by taking further actions to reduce expenses and to prioritize our efforts. We have initiated a number of cost savings which will layer in progressively over this fiscal year. As a result of these actions, we now expect fiscal 2009 operating expenses of approximately $27.4 billion. Going forward, we expect to maintain our operating expenses broadly flat in fiscal year 2010. Moving to the other drivers of earnings per share, we continue to experience \u2013 we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the year. Other income may be negatively affected by further market movements. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases over the long-term. However, given the increased uncertainty in the current market, our repurchase activity will slow in the second half of fiscal year 2009. With those overall comments and outlook, I would now like to hand the call over to Steve, so he can share his perspectives before we take your questions.\nSteve Ballmer: Thanks Chris. We are certainly in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime set of economic conditions. The perspective I would bring is not one of recession, what I would say rather is the economy is resetting to a lower level of business and consumer spending that is based largely on the reduced leveraged in the economy. Consumers cannot refinance their homes, don\u2019t have that extra money to buy discretionary second and third PCs. In the business market, we certainly see a production in capital expense based upon lack of leverage in business conditions. IT spending represents about 50% of US business capital spend. And so neither the consumer nor the business side of the technology industry is immune to these economic conditions. As a participant in the market that at least in some areas like our client business has a very significant market share, you certainly feel the overall market impact most clearly. In these times, I think there is three things to focus in on, and not surprisingly two of them are very similar to things we focus in on everyday. The three things are, number one, innovation, which I will talk about. Number two is market share, because even in a market that is suffering, share increases drive revenue growth. We are always focused on share but particularly now. And number three is efficiency and effective resource prioritization and allocation, which is where I want to start and one where perhaps we spent a little less time with you historically. We are long-term and I\u2019ll come back to this. We remain incredibly positive on Microsoft, the technology industry, the opportunity for innovation, and yet now it\u2019s certainly the time to ask critically which of our investments should we prioritize and how can we get more efficient, get the same amount of work done, if you will, for less. We have been, through an exercise and continue through an exercise, looking at work processes and driving for efficiency, rightsizing and prioritizing some of our investments. And we've had to take a number of actions, we are taking a number of actions and in some sense manage our cost base. Our cost base has grown, as many of you know, significantly over the last few years. And while as Chris said, we don\u2019t plan on shrinking it in FY '10, we are really putting the brakes on at a new level and quite significantly putting the brakes on. With that said, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in important areas of opportunity for the company and so even while we take out up to 5000 jobs, we will also be adding a few thousand jobs back in the areas like search, where we continue to see incredible opportunity to do good work. So, we will take out, put back in, but in aggregate manage expenses consistent with the comments Chris had a chance to make. In terms of market share, I think we have some great opportunity. Bill talked about the performance of Xbox, sold over 5 million Windows mobile units this quarter, which was great, we got a lot of opportunity in search and we are glad to have search volume up so significantly for us this quarter. Our server and tools business reflects our ongoing market share improvements basically in both Windows Server and in our SQL business. You\u2019ll see us continue to invest particularly in Web Servers and technical computing as we move forward. In the client business, we sold north of 50 million units of Windows and had another big chunk. Unfortunately probably got used without pay, but not paid for, and yet we lost maybe a point of share as Apple sold 2.5 million Macs during the same period. We have big plans there with Windows 7 and everything that we have coming forward. And certainly in this economic climate, the kind of price premiums that people pay for Macintoshes versus PCs I think will be looked at farmer critically by customers as a number of reviewers have started to note. In the case of netbooks, we have gone from no share to, as the guys said, over 80% share and climbing. It is a whole interesting topic in and of itself. Our office business with the consumer market, unit volumes are up dramatically year-on-year, over 14%, which is a business people think where we have high share and we have great opportunity. So a lot of focus in the enterprise space, in the online space, in the entertainment area, in the client area. There are a lot of opportunities to work on market share, both from a product development standpoint and from a sales and marketing perspective. Our product pipeline and the work we are doing in innovation, I am excited about. We have had first looks on Windows 7, we had good market reaction to Windows Azure, a new version of Office, Office 14. I am excited to be out in the next year or so. Windows Server 2008 Release 2 builds on the strength of Windows Server. We have certainly got our work cut out for us. There are businesses where we got a lot of work to do, where we don\u2019t have leading positions, and there is some businesses where we\u2019ve got leading positions, which have phenomenal new products to come. But we will continue to invest strongly in R&D, that gets very well funded in the operating expense strategy that Chris talked about, but at the same time, we are prioritizing, we are focusing on the most important stuff as we go forward. Certainly while the size and scope of this economic dislocation is unprecedented and may delay some technology adoption in the industry at large, I don\u2019t think there is any stopping the forward march of our industry or of Microsoft. And in the long run, let us call it the pause that the economy is imposing on our industry will certainly just be that, it is a pause and there will be renewed strong growth in the technology industry overall and certainly at Microsoft. And we\u2019re focused, we are focused on efficiency, on market share, and on renovation as we drive forward. And with that, I am going to hand things back over to Bill so we can start taking some of your questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Steve. Let\u2019s now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible, so please avoid multipart questions and I will strictly limit you to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator instructions). And our first question comes from Brent Thill with Citigroup.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Good morning. If your fiscal 2009 guidance holds, this will be the fourth consecutive year of operating margin decline. Do you think you're taking quick enough action to realign the business to this lower demand environment?\nChris Liddell: Yes, Brent, we believe certainly taking as you saw $600 million worth of costs out in the second quarter, which is almost 10% of our cost base for the quarter, was very prompt action. And if you look at $1.5 billion for this year as well, that we believe in the context of a deteriorating economic that really accelerated in December, so we're talking about reacting to the last in particular month to six weeks or so of economic data. We think the actions we took were actually quite very fast and appropriate for that now. I agree with the margin comment, but clearly also the mix of our business is changing quite significantly as well. So as we sit here today, based on the facts that we have seen in particular over the last few weeks, we think we have taken the right degree of action in terms of reducing the cost base but continuing to still invest against the revenue that we see coming forward.\nSteve Ballmer: I think one thing you have to understand is with our margin structure i.e. with high margins as a percentage of revenue, we're going to be far more volatile both on the upside and on the downside due to fluctuations in revenue. And unlike a company that is sort of more about manufacturing where everything kind of scales with volume, we have a much larger fixed costs chunk. And on the upside, when revenue goes strong, it\u2019s a chance to increase margins, but when revenue is weaker, it is likely that margin percentages will decline.\nChris Liddell: And when you look at the initiatives we have taken, depending on the item you are talking about, whether it's from people to things like travel expenses to vendor cost, we're taking out somewhere between 5% and 15% of the cost line that we\u2019re talking about, which we think in this environment relative to the reset in the economy is broadly the right level.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks. Next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you are laying off 5,000 people. I'm wondering if all of those are Microsoft employees, or there are also outside contractors that work at Microsoft that you're not including in that total? And I guess along that line, are you including cash severance charges that you are going to take for the reductions in force, are you including that in your operating expense guidance for fiscal year 2009? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: Yes, Heather. The outside contractors are not included in that number, and we will be certainly looking to reduce that cost line, probably in proportion by more than what we are talking about in terms of internal people. So the 5,000 jobs we talk about are entirely Microsoft related.\nSteve Ballmer: It is not really five \u2013 I mean let me make sure the math is clear. We may eliminate up to 5,000 jobs, but we are also adding a few thousand jobs.\nSteve Ballmer: And we're talking here now primarily about operating expense head count as opposed to cost of goods, which varies in its own criteria. So on the operating expense line, I expect this to been down more like a net sort of 2,000 to 3,000.\nHeather Bellini: Right. Then to Chris\u2019 point, it looks like you will end up cutting more outside contractors than the 5,000, or than the 2,000 to 3,000 you just mentioned?\nChris Liddell: Yes, those numbers are all internal people, Heather. The external contractors I guess if we think about more in terms of the dollars that we spend overall, that's on top of the numbers that we are talking about and that could be down up to 15%.\nHeather Bellini: Okay. And then the cash severance charge part?\nChris Liddell: The cash severance charge is not included in the operating expense that we are talking about. It will not \u2013 we are looking at the number and it obviously depends on the final number that we talk about with people, but we will call that out separately in the third quarter for the 1,400 people that we are talking about today, and then I guess that as other people leave the company, we will look at the charge at that time.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Let's go to the next question please.\nAdam Holt: Good morning. My first question is about the buyback, is the slowing of buyback activity principally related to just capital preservation, or do you see an opportunity to maybe be more aggressive on the M&A side given some of the depressed valuations? And then just secondarily can you walk us through maybe even some high-level thoughts on how you view the PC market? I know you are not giving explicit guidance, but what your expectations are for piracy, any just kind of guidelines for how we should be thinking about PC growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: Sure. On the buyback, it is both the factors that you mentioned. Certainly capital preservation in this environment is more important than it's ever been. On the acquisition side, clearly the opportunity to buy shares is very good. And Microsoft, having said that, the opportunity to buy other companies has probably never been better relative to their prices. Having said that, I wouldn't expect M&A activity to be particularly significant in the second half of the year, simply because I don't think the market generally has yet lowered their expectations to the new level of prices we're talking about. So we will continue to buy some small medium-sized businesses as we normally do. Prices are certainly coming down and that's an opportunity from our point of view, but I think the level of activity will be relatively low, certainly in the next quarter or two. But the opportunity there afterwards to buy companies, again generally speaking the small and medium sized, I think is going to be very good and that's part of thinking about why we're trying to retain that capital and retain our powder as much as possible. On the PC market, you are right, we're not giving guidance. I gave some directional thoughts. We aren\u2019t predicting and clearly macro economic rather than Microsoft specific factors are really going to drive the PC market over the next six months. But you have so realistically the base cases for continuation or even possibly a slight deterioration from the second quarter in what we described the traditional PC market.\nSteve Ballmer: It is worth remembering that the market has let me just say broadly speaking four pieces to it. Business PCs, for which we receive our highest royalty, consumer PCs, netbook, netbook PCs, and then let's just say everything in emerging markets, of which China is half of that. And I mentioned that because we have different pricing in each and we have particularly in the last one we have some high piracy dynamics, which affect us. PC market overall is probably strongest today in emerging markets, second strongest in the netbooks, third strongest in home PCs, and weakest in business PCs, because that's where \u2013 it is a place where businesses will say, we will just extend the refresh cycle. So our economic drivers don't look like overall PC market, they look like the components, and unfortunately right now we are in let\u2019s say tough wind relative even to that mix.\nChris Liddell: And the other thing I would say, and I think this is generic to all the businesses, is we saw quite a different shape in the quarter. I mean December in particular was relatively weak inside the quarter. October trading conditions were generally speaking in line with our expectations, the first half of November was, and we like I think most companies out there saw the weakness really started to set in in late November and through December. So to some extent, at the end of the year, we extrapolate the quarter overall or the conditions that we and most companies saw in December, as to what sort of an environment we\u2019d see in the first half, and that creates if you like the bookings of expectations, but those are quite wide. If you extrapolate the quarter overall, or extrapolate December, you get quite different answers, and that's true of the PC market, also true for business overall.\nAdam Holt: Good color, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: And next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.\nSteve Ballmer: I don\u2019t know that you can pick any magic number because the dynamic \u2013 unfortunately, the dynamics shift fairly quickly. My guess is, wherever businesses are going to reset, that will reset more quickly than where the consumer will wind up resetting to. The consumer will be more volatile. Our business customers will go through one round of thinking rethinking budgets, and then they will reset it at a new level. And so I think we are going to see more dynamism unfortunately in that number.\nChris Liddell: Yes, Sarah, if I add a little bit color for that, and there are more \u2013 as Steve says, there are more moving pieces this quarter than there are normally, but if I try and simplify it a little bit, if you take what we described as our traditional PC market, which is a mixture of the business and consumer that Steve just mentioned, and take that as one growth rate, netbooks will clearly grow in excess of that and give us a little bit of a revenue uplift. We will see probably some inventory contractions. Attach rates on average are probably going to be much the same, we might lose some in the traditional market but gain a bit on the netbooks side, and then we will see our traditional shift to emerging markets, although interestingly they have slowed more than traditional markets inside the quarter. You throw all those things together and we would expect that revenue in client to be broadly in line with the growth rate from the traditional PC market, so all the other pluses and minuses will generally speaking cancel themselves out.\nSarah Friar: But not as big a delta as we saw this quarter?\nChris Liddell: Relative to the PC market, in fact, we saw it\u2019s about the same. So the traditional PC market we think shrinks somewhere between 7% and 10% in the quarter and our revenue for the client business was down around 8%, so in that range. So that sort of trend based on the set of factors which Steve mentioned are moving quite quickly, but if I hold relative to the second quarter, you're probably going to see that same overall trend in the back half.\nSarah Friar: Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks. Operator, next question?\nKarl Sharingan: Hi. Thank you very much. Steve, since we have you on the line, just thought I\u2019d ask you a question on the headcount reduction. You pointed out that the consumer spending and business spending has contracted pretty sharply and yet we are talking about a 5,000 person headcount reduction here which still leaves the operating expenses for this fiscal 2009 up about 10% despite the revenue growth of what looks to be about a percent or so? So I'm wondering what your thoughts are, what are your assumptions? I mean it looks like you're factoring in some sort of a rebound, maybe on 12 months, 15 months? Certainly you don't want to lay-off a lot of people if you end up having to hire them back when the economy starts to turn. I'm just wondering if that's the way you are thinking about it, or are you actually open to revisiting the cost structure if indeed the economic conditions continue to act the way that you portrait, that is a vastly lower level of consumer and business spending on technology? Are you open to another round of cuts if you have to in order to bring the OpEx in line with net revenue growth that we are looking at in 2009 and 2010?\nSteve Ballmer: Well, no. I would say actually a couple of things. I don't know about that. We are not used to down markets. So PC market, the traditional market, as Chris calls them, is down 7, or whatever it is, 8% or so. But 8% is vast, something that's always grown a lot. But maybe some of your attributes, I would modify slightly. We are certainly dealing with unprecedented grounds. Our model is not for a quick rebound. Our model is things go down, as I said, and they reset. The economy shrinks and then it doesn't rebound, it builds from a lower base effectively. So that kind of built in in our work on costs overall reflects that model. So no, I'm not expecting a balance. And when we did our resizing, we did our resizing with an eye both towards margin, total profit, shareholders short-term and long-term investment in the growth opportunities that we see. So no, I would say that if the economy stays down and then builds slowly, we're probably at about the expense base, we will stay at about the expense base that Chris talked about. You can't tell, the economy could also get a whole lot worse, it could get a whole lot better, but our basic view is that things go down, they are down for a while, a year or two years, I don't know what it will be, and then start to build back again. That's kind of the basic planning model behind this resizing of our cost base. You could say that means you could see lower total profit percent margin and that's certainly possible.\nBill Koefoed: Next question.\nOperator: And next is Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi, guys. I just wanted to dig into the severance charges for a minute, you mentioned that you are clearing those in your GAAP OpEx guidance, what level would you expect that to be in the second half of this year?\nChris Liddell: Yes. I said just to be clear, that it wasn't in the number of 27.4 that I mentioned, so it would be on top of that. And we\u2019d expect it to be several tens of millions, but less than 100 million to give you an order of magnitude, and it\u2019s going to depend entirely on the number of people that we talk about, yes, the individual circumstances. So I can't give you an exact number, but that's the order of magnitude.\nBill Koefoed: Next question operator.\nOperator: And next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Hi guys. How are you?\nSteve Ballmer: Good.\nBrad Reback: I'm a little confused. If, Chris, as you talk about on the share repurchase side, slowing it down in the second half of the year, but on the other side when we are talking about $1.5 billion of cost coming out over the next 18 months, clearly it is still a very valuable franchise with a lot of cash flow, why not take this opportunity to buy back probably the best investment there is at least from your perspective?\nChris Liddell: Yes. My comments were certainly from the \u2013 over the long term, we remain committed to the buyback activity. The buyback activity in the first half was actually very high. All I did was signal that we expect in the second half that will moderate from that level. Will we continue to be a net buyer of our shares? Absolutely. Do we think liquidity in the current environment? Certainly, until we get a clearer pattern on economic activity overall. Is it a premium? Yes, I do. Do I think there's going to be some outstanding opportunities over the medium term to potentially buy some other companies that we have looked at? I\u2019ll mitigate that by saying small to medium, yes, I do. So the opportunity cost of buying our shares has also gone up as well as the price going down. We are just trying to balance those factors, but we certainly are not talking about getting out of buyback activity as a general concept.\nSteve Ballmer: I will remind you that there was a time when tendered our shares at 25 bucks because they looked super cheap for us. That we could \u2013 I mean it is hard to know what the underlying market is going to do, and asset values, and we just think it makes sense to keep a little bit more liquid for a while.\nChris Liddell: But also being consistent on this, we try not to tell you in advance what we are doing on the buyback activity. We do that in the quarter, all I'm doing is giving you a directional trend.\nBill Koefoed: Next question operator.\nOperator: And next is John Difucci with JPMorgan.\nJohn Difucci: Thank you. Guys, can you just help me a little bit here in reconciling sort of a follow-up to some of the other questions, because you're talking about the declining environment actually meaning going down, and the uncertainty going forward, and you're resetting expenses to reflect this. But your new guidance for operating expenses is still up meaningfully in the second half year over year when you adjust for the third quarter charge last year. And it just if you really think things are \u2013 and they obviously are, we all know they are tough out there, and today it looks like it's coming down, it is getting worse year over year, but your expenses, you're laying off some people, no one like to see anybody get laid of, I am sure you don\u2019t, we don\u2019t, but net 2,000 to 3000 out of 91,000 or whatever you have, are you really resetting expenses to reflect what is out there?\nChris Liddell: Bear in mind of course in the year, half of the year has already gone, and we are reacting to a situation, as I say, and in particular, it\u2019s in the back half of the quarter. So \u2013\nJohn Difucci: This is year over year for just the second half. Your expenses are still up, your operating expenses are still going to be if you exclude the third quarter last year that 1.35 fine, so it is \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead, Chris.\nChris Liddell: Your points are valid, and I am very happy to address that. What I described it as changing the momentum of our expense base going forward, but clearly we already have things in the pipeline and people who are employed, who we have to bear the expense of. So we are talking about a plan that stretches out over the next 18 months as opposed to the next few months of which the first few steps were taken in the quarter, that's why we were able to reduce by 600 million, 1.5 billion over this year and flat the year afterwards, and a program to reduce not only people internally, but the balance of initiatives that we took. So these things are layering in over time and are in response \u2013 you remember I talked about it at the last call, we are taking a set of initiatives in that quarter, and we said \u2013 I said at the time that if things got worse, we will probably look to do more. Things did get worse, and we did do more. So we're talking about layering in as we see economic conditions change. So, yes, we would all like to be able to take things out instantaneously. The reality is that we can't do that as quickly as we would like, but you will see us take actions that have an impact over the next few months.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question.\nOperator: And next is Todd Raker from Deutsche Bank.\nTodd Raker: Thanks guys. Chris, I was wondering if you look at the overall corporation, could you give us a sense in terms of how kind of consumer versus transactional business versus annuity breaks out? And what's the risk as we look at this spending environment as the annuity business starts to show some dramatic impact over the next kind of six to 18 months?\nChris Liddell: The annuity business was good in the first quarter and the second quarter, so that\u2019s certainly one of the strengths of that business model has been the relative insulation of our results from as a result of the annuity business, that's a very good point. Non-annuity business shrink during the second quarter, annuity business actually, the revenue associated with annuity business actually grew. So it is providing us some degree of insulation and we're talking about results obviously that are lower than expectations, but to just keep that in context, we still grew revenue 2% in probably the worst environment that we have seen. Part of the reason for that was the strength of annuity. Over the time, and in particular if we see the business environment deteriorate in the second half, clearly that annuity business will slow. Having said that, our re-signing rates inside the enterprises was broadly in line with historic rates. Billings were broadly flat in the annuity area year over year, so they aren\u2019t growing as fast as they would, but they weren\u2019t declining either. They were broadly flat. We have a very big second half from a billings perspective, so that we have the opportunity actually to put some more money back in the bank. So on that side of the business, certainly stronger historically, and that will provide us some degree of cushion as we go through the next six months to 12 months.\nSteve Ballmer: The way I would characterize it is it is a bit of a dance oscillation. We are actually recognizing now contracts signed two or three years ago. The contracts, we are re-signing contracts \u2013 sometimes we're re-signing contracts with companies that have less employees, they have less PCs, so even if they are renewing their contracts, they may not be renewing at the same dollar value that the contracts expire at. The effect of that event shows up under revenue and all that stuff in the books. But from a net income, it takes longer. So if we stay in this cycle and there is fewer people employed in the US, eventually that does ripple through to the annuity business also.\nChris Liddell: But non-annuity is likely to be more volatile and more negative than the annuity which is likely to provide, as Steve says, it is likely to lower the oscillation of revenue overall.\nTodd Raker: And any rough \u2013\nChris Liddell: Sorry, what was that?\nTodd Raker: I was just trying to get a rough sense for the percentage of the business that is annuity driven?\nChris Liddell: It changes a bit quarter by quarter because of things likes Xbox which is all clearly non-annuity and moves things. But it generally varies between 30% and 40% of our revenue.\nTodd Raker: Okay, thank guys.\nBill Koefoed: Next question operator.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Steve, can you talk about as you look at the portfolio of businesses you have and obviously if you go through this economy the way it is, I mean when or if do you think you and the Board would take action to review your portfolio and make a strategic decision to possibly divest off certain assets or technologies, any color around the strategy in particular would be helpful? Thanks.\nSteve Ballmer: I like our portfolio.\nRobert Breza: Okay.\nSteve Ballmer: The Board likes our portfolio.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, and this will be our last question.\nOperator: And the last question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: Hi, good morning. So you said you are slowing buybacks to preserve capital. You said no significant M&A in the back half because the sellers haven't reset their expectations and yet you're adding search jobs. What are you really telling us here? Are you saying basically it\u2019s a status quo with Yahoo?\nSteve Ballmer: I don't think we said anything about Yahoo. I don't think we have anything to stay about Yahoo. I think \u2013 I\u2019ve to see. Even I think I\u2019d been quite public about the fact I think there is advantages with consumers, advertisers, Microsoft and Yahoo through a search partnership and we like to do one. I know Carol Bartz well from Autodesk days and glad to see her at the helm of Yahoo, and if it is appropriate, I'm sure we will have the right discussion.\nChris Liddell: Yes. Just to be clear, my comment about resetting the expectations was certainly not Yahoo specific. I think we are being quite clear that that acquisition is no longer on the books. It was a more general comment and my prediction of lower activity in the second half is just a prediction and nothing more than that. Clearly, we saw an opportunity as we do in terms of buying businesses one or two a month, and we take it. I am just simply making the psychological comment that most people on a downmarket hope that they will give last year's price rather than this year\u2019s price.\nSteve Ballmer: We have only bought one thing ever over $1.5 billion, and we have only bought three things over \u2013 other than that over $1 billion. We're not big M&A doers in general. And as Chris says, I know even small M&A is tougher as people get small, that is sub $1 billion acquisition prices are tougher because people just don't know how to value their businesses today.\nKatherine Egbert: Okay, thanks.\nBill Koefoed: So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you in a few weeks when we will provide our Annual Mid Year Strategic Update in New York.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And now, I'll return the call over to Chris.\nChris Liddell: Thanks, Bill. I'll begin with highlights from our first quarter performance and outlook for the rest of the fiscal 2009. We delivered strong first quarter financial results with revenue, operating income and earnings per share all meeting or exceeding the high end of our guidance despite what was obviously a very challenging environment. Let me just mention a few key items of our first quarter. Revenue from Microsoft Business Division and Server and Tools segments grew a combined $1.3 billion, or 19%, driven by healthy demand from enterprise customers. Client revenue grew 2% with growth impacted by the expected reduction of Q4 channel inventory and a shift of the sales mix to lower price netbooks and the units sold in emerging markets. Consumer demand for the Xbox 360 resulted in the outperformance by Entertainment and Devices division. Our Online Services Business grew revenue of very good 15% in a challenging online advertising environment. We refreshed our product lineup with several important releases and we also increased the dividend by 18% and announced a new $40 billion share repurchase authorization. While we're pleased with the overall results, the macroeconomic environment clearly weakened throughout the quarter. Like many other companies we experienced deterioration in the spending environment over the last few weeks of the quarter, which has continued into October. Accordingly, we're updating our business outlook to reflect the increased risks and the likelihood of continued economic slowdown. In July we indicated that our guidance was based on an expectation that economic conditions would improve in the second half of our fiscal year and this clearly now appears unlikely to occur. We're not economic forecasters, and there is a high degree of uncertainty in outlook based on the state of the economy. As a result we've adjusted our guidance approach as follows. At the top end we're assuming a mild recession, and a relatively modest growth rate for all IT-based products. While at the bottom end we're assuming a deeper recession in the economy an end-season lower growth for IT. Clearly there is a possibility that the economy recovers faster than we predict or that it deteriorates more severely. In all scenarios we're focused on maintaining the positive delta in growth rate between our revenue and the overall IT environment. We feel extremely good about our relative competitive position, our ability to continue growing faster than general IT spending and our ability to deliver value to our customers in this environment. We believe our exceptionally strong cash flow, high unearned revenue and $25 billion in cash and investments on hand will allow us to weather any economic contraction in relatively better terms than most. It's also clearly important to keep perspective. We still foresee an increase in demand for our products and the potential to drive revenue and earnings per share growth from high single to low double-digits for this financial year, which will be an exceptional performance in this environment. With those high-level themes I'm going to turn the call over to Bill now for more details on how we closed out the first quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Chris. I'll discuss top line financial and business momentum points, followed by revenue performance for each of our business units. Then I'll review the rest of the income statement. All growth comparisons relate to the comparable quarter of last year unless otherwise specified. In the first quarter we met or exceeded our high end guidance for revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. Revenue grew over 9% to $15.1 billion, approximately $150 million above our high end guidance. Our annuity sales mix which is approximately 25% of our billed revenue grew over three percentage points year-over-year. Enterprise agreement renewal rates were in line with historical trends. The remainder of our product to the (inaudible) of quarter was approximately 35% from OEMs, about 20% from license only sales and the balance from our other businesses. Our unearned revenue grew over 16% to $13.5 billion, but was down sequentially from the prior quarter. The sequential decline was in line with our guidance and followed normal seasonal patterns. Our contracted not billed balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to over $13 billion. When taken together with reported revenue, total bookings for the company increased 6% this quarter on top of our over 30% total bookings growth reported in Q1 FY '08. Overall, changes in foreign exchange rates added about three percentage points to our revenue growth. Now I will provide revenue highlights by business segment starting with Windows clients. The Client revenue grew 2% to $4.2 billion, missing guidance by four percentage points. I'll review the main drivers behind Client revenues that contributed to this performance beginning with PC unit growth. We estimate that the PC unit growth rate for the quarter was between 10% and 12%. While this tracks to the overall forecast we provided in July, the underlying mix was different than we expected entering the quarter. Specifically, growth of traditional PC units was several points lower than we expected. This was offset by growth in the new low end, netbook segment. From a geographic perspective, we estimate mature market traditional PC growth of flat to low single-digits with netbooks adding about eight points to the growth. In emerging markets we continued to see strong double-digit growth across all segments. During the quarter, our Windows OEM license units increased by 8%, a few points lower than the overall hardware market. The shortfall between OEM unit growth and hardware growth was primarily driven by inventory reductions in the OEM channel. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we exited the fourth quarter with OEM channel inventory above historic norms, which were worked down during the quarter. Despite healthy unit growth, OEM revenue declined 1% year-over-year as the average selling price declined. This was primarily the result of two factors. The mix shift in netbooks and continued mix shift to emerging markets, both of which have lower average selling prices than our historical average selling price. At this stage it is too early to determine the extent to which the new netbooks segment is cannibalizing the traditional consumer PC market sales or simply capturing a new market opportunity, so we believe that there are likely aspects of both. That said, customers are increasingly opting for the value, diversity and choice that Microsoft Windows provides. We have increased attach rates on these form factors to mirror the traditional PC market, so we are well positioned to participate in this segment. The remainder of Client revenue comes from commercial and retail licensing. This portion of the business grew over 20% driven by continued strength in client annuity licensing as business customers recognize the value of our Windows Vista enterprise offering, including those to help them reduce costs by more efficiently managing their desktop infrastructure. Our Server and Tools revenue grew 17% to $3.4 billion, marking the business 25th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Annuity licensing grew faster than non-annuity licensing driving Server and Tools unearned revenue up over 28% from the prior year. This reflects continued customer commitment to our long-term product road map and underscores the increasingly critical role our server products perform in transforming customers IT departments into strategic assets. The releases during the quarter of Sequel Server 2008 and Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 demonstrated our ongoing commitment to help customers create more cost effective and flexible data centers. Meanwhile, demand for our consulting and support services to deploy Microsoft technology remained strong, driving revenue growth of 19%. The Online service business grew revenue 15% to $770 million. Online advertising revenue also grew 15% with search revenue growing faster than display revenue. We continue to see healthy growth in our traffic to page views and query searches both up on sequential and year-over-year basis. During the quarter we partnered with NBC to make the 2008 Beijing Olympics the largest ever media event on the web, showcasing Silverlight as it served up 70 million video streams and 600 million minutes of video content on NBColympics.com. As new online advertising model strived to increasingly differentiate based on user experience. Microsoft technologies like Silverlight become even more pivotal to our partners success. Microsoft Business Division revenue was up 20% to $4.9 billion exceeding our high end guidance by four percentage points. Business revenue grew 16% driven by strong sales of enterprise agreements and Client access license suites. Microsoft Office, SharePoint, Dynamics and Unified Communications all continued strong sales momentum. Consumer revenue grew 36% driven by higher than expected sales into the retail and OEM channels resulting from well received promotional pricing programs for the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Entertainment and Devices division revenue declined 6% to $1.8 billion, but exceeded our high end guidance. The anticipated revenue decline due the comparison to the quarter a year ago that included the launch of Halo 3 was milder than expected due to stronger Xbox 360 console sales into the channel. We sold 2.2 million Xbox 360 consoles representing over 20% growth, as retailers stocked inventories throughout the holiday season. Based on US MPD numbers released last week, Xbox 360 outsold PS3 by over 100,000 consoles during the quarter while achieving an industry leading game attach rate of 8.1. Also, earlier this month at the Tokyo game show we announced that Xbox Live has over 14 million members, roughly doubling in membership for each of the last two years. In spite of console price cuts taken in the quarter and the absence of Halo 3, the Entertainment and Devices Division increased operating income by 7%, expanding its operating margins by over a percentage point. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was $2.8 billion and operating expenses were $6.2 billion. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue declined half a percentage point to 18.9%. This gross margin expansion was driven by lower console manufacturing, warranty and component costs, as well as a mix shift towards the lower cost Xbox 360 arcade console. Operating income was $6 billion, up 3% from the year-ago period. Other income and expenses was an $8 million loss for the quarter as dividend was offset by asset revaluations. It should be noted that we continue to be pleased by our treasury team's performance in a very challenging capital market environment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, a percentage point lower than expected, driven by an earnings mix increase in lower tax jurisdictions. During the quarter, we repurchased 223 million shares or almost $6 billion of company stock and paid out a billion dollars in dividends to shareholders. Of the $6 billion in share buybacks, approximately $3.3 billion was made under the new repurchase plan that we announced in September. Diluted shares outstanding were 9.2 billion, down 3.5% from the prior year as a result of the share repurchases. Earnings per share were $0.48, at the high end of our guidance, representing growth of 7%. So, in summary, we had a good quarter with revenue above expectations, operating income in line with guidance, and earnings per share at the high end of guidance. With that, let me turn it back to Chris who will provide you with our second quarter and full year guidance.\nChris Liddell: I'm going to spend my remaining time on the call talking about what we're seeing in the market and providing additional details on the second quarter and the full year. Our guidance now assumes an outcome between a mild and a deeper recessionary environment. It's important that we give you some background therefore to what we're seeing in the marketplace. Over the first two months of this quarter we experienced much the same economic conditions as we saw during the second half of fiscal 2008, with demand actually a little better than our historic seasonality. However, in September, as the credit crisis unfolded, many partners and customers were faced with market uncertainty and credit restrictions which impacted the rate at which they purchased software. We've seen this behavior continue into October and while we're optimistic about the actions the governments have taken to unfreeze the financial markets there will be some spillover into the real economy. However, even in this environment of softening demand, recent third party research continues to call for growth in overall technology spending, with the enterprise software portion of the spending expected to be up in the high single-digit range. Our approach will be to tailor our business to whatever the economy brings, focusing on outperforming our competitors and in doing so, to outgrow the overall IT market. We will be agile, not only to customer demands in the changing environment but also to our own patterns of spending. Given that, we have three main areas of focus. First, our philosophy of providing high value products at low total ownership costs as a competitive advantage in these times. Most IT leaders today are looking at their budgets and determining how to do more while spending less. We expect Microsoft's low cost, standardized platforms and solutions will be particularly strong in the time when enterprises are unwilling to embark on complex customized IT solutions. We believe we have some compelling products that will reduce our customers' costs. We expect these to be particularly competitive in this environment. For example, virtualization with Windows Server Hyper-V and System [sender] Management Tools, which allow customers to reduce hardware costs, increase server utilization rates and simplify system maintenance while lowering power and facility costs. We offer the lowest PCO in the industry with our solution about one-third the cost of our largest competitor. This value proposition is already successful as evidenced in IDC's recent report which shows that in the second quarter Microsoft's share of the X86 server virtualization market climbed to nearly 25%. Additionally, with our help customers can experience general cost savings and improved efficiency across their organization. For example using unified communication software and services including Office Live Meeting, which help us improve collaboration and increase productivity while reducing travel and telephonic expenses. SharePoint improves the coordination across organizations, enables people to find and act on information anywhere within and across organizations and decreases IT support costs by empowering end users. The second area we're focused on in the current economic environment is internal operational efficiency and expense management. In the near term, we're reassessing our business plan and pulling back spending in lower priority areas. As a result, better than our guidance is a $400 million to $500 million decrease in operating expenses. This saving can be categorized as follows. Lower headcount related costs as we review the hiring plans, making adjustments to our headcount growth. Lower marketing expenses as we're adjusting our spending plans to correspond to our updated economic outlook. Lower CapEx spend on data centers and other general savings including travel expenses and vendor services. These savings will progressively layer in, translating to economic savings particularly later this year and carrying forward into the next fiscal year as well. We are also putting in place other initiatives on a contingency basis that we can either dial up or down as we see economic changes unfold. If macroeconomic conditions worsen then we will endeavor to reduce our operating expenses accordingly. Third, we'll focus our investment dollars in key strategic opportunities. Continue to manage our business for the long-term in anticipation of the eventual economic recovery. While our short-term results will be impacted by the current economic environment, our long-term technology outlook remains strong. Long-term trends, which power our business including the development of IT infrastructure and growing IT penetration in places like China and even other emerging markets remains intact. So with those comments, let's move to guidance. Looking to the second quarter we expect revenue of 17.3 to $17.8 billion, which represents a year-over-year increase of 6% to 9%. For the full year, we're providing updated guidance for revenue of $64.9 million to $66.4 billion, growing 7% to 10%. Let me provide you with some of our revenue guidance by segments and some additional details of and the assumptions underlying it. Beginning with our Client division, we see second quarter growth of 7 to 10%, and full year growth of 2% to 6%. Underlying this guidance we see significant variability in the potential PC hardware demand. As a result, we made some adjustments to our forecast of PC units and now expect PC unit growth of 10% to 12% for the second quarter and 8% to 12% for the overall fiscal year. You can see that we've widened our forecast range in the second half of our fiscal year as variability in the market demand clearly becomes more pronounced. The forecast also reflects continuation of the trends we saw in the first quarter, and assumes the following. Traditional mature market PC units will grow in the low single-digits, but with high potential variability. Emerging markets units will continue to grow mid to high teens. Sales in Xbox led about five percentage points of growth to the overall PC market. Moving on to our Server and Tools segment, we're now foreseeing revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the second quarter and 15% to 17% for the year. Despite a more cautious IT spending outlook, and in particular lower forecast for non-annuity license sales to small and medium businesses, we continue to expect revenue to grow strong double-digits across our Server platform products and services, reflection of the strength of the product portfolio and its relative value to customers. Microsoft Business Division revenues should be up 7% to 8% in the second quarter and 12% to 13% for the year. We expect to see continued healthy consumer and enterprise demand for our Office, SharePoint, Dynamics and Unified Communications offerings. We forecast revenue in the Online Services businesses to increase 6% to 10% in Q2 and 10% to 13% for the year. This includes online advertising growth of about 15% for the year. Still healthy in a more difficult advertising spending environment we expect. Our display advertising business is probably the most economically sensitive of our revenue stream and therefore has the highest potential to either under or outperform depending on the state of the economy. The Entertainment Devices division we're forecasting revenue to be down 5% to up 1% for Q2 and down 3% or flat for the full year. Revenue growth is impacted by our recent Xbox 360 pricing cuts, buts offset by increases in console volumes and lower costs. As I outlined in July, we still expect the division to continue its profitability throughout this year. Taken together, we still expect to grow revenue faster than market. For example we're forecasting MBD and Server and Tools to grow revenue a combined 14% to 15%, about six points above Gartner's recent forecast for overall IT software spending of around 9%. As a result of the changes to our revenue and operating expense forecast, the operating income for the second quarter is expected to be between $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion, and for the year we expect operating income to be between $24.4 billion and $25.5 billion. For the second quarter, we expect EPS, earnings per share of $0.51 to $0.53 and for the fiscal year we have updated our EPS guidance to be between $2 to $2.10, still achieving double-digit growth of 12% at the top end. These earnings assume effective tax rate of 26.5%, a point and-a-half lower than we expected in July. From a balance sheet perspective, we expect total unearned revenue to finish fiscal 2009 up 2% to 5% and when talking sequential changes on unearned revenue Q1 to Q2 we expect the balance to be down sequentially. Contracted not billed should also finish 2009 up from current levels. I'm also pleased with our continued progress on capital structure and dividend policy. During the quarter as you've seen, the Board authorized $40 billion share repurchase program. We issued debt in the form of commercial paper for the first time and we've been issuing that at an interest cost of less than 1% and increased our dividend by 18%. Given the uncertainty surrounding the current environment, it's important that you clearly consider some of the risks of this forecast, which includes the normal competitive legal, mix and execution risks, however in addition there is also a high degree of uncertainty as to the path and economic demand and that's reflected in a somewhat wider guidance range. So, before closing and taking your questions, I'd like to offer the following long-term perspectives. We cannot control the economy, but we can control our relative performance versus the economy and versus overall IT spend. We continue to forecast outgrowing the market regardless of the economic conditions. On the spending front, we're carefully examining all of our businesses for opportunities to manage expenses and have already implemented some initiatives as I detailed earlier. We will adapt our cost base to the evolving economy while simultaneously making appropriate investments to position ourselves for continued long-term success when the economy recovers. On balance, I am happy that we're managing the company with the right balance of short-term earnings performance and driving long-term shareholder value. So with those comments I'll hand the call over to Bill so we can get started taking some of your questions. Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Chris. Let's now proceed to questions. We want to accommodate questions from as many people as possible. So please avoid multi-part questions and limit yourself to just one question. Operator, will you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Okay, thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with UBS.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you. Good afternoon Chris and Kevin. I had two quick questions for you, Chris. What is your assumptions for premium mix in the Client business for the December quarter and for fiscal year '09. That's been moving around a lot and obviously being impacted by the netbook trend. And then the other question would be how should we expect Client margins to be impacted by the trend going forward? Thank you.\nChris Liddell: On the premium mix, it's in the mid-70s, Heather and for Q2 and for the rest of the year we expect that to be about the same. So somewhere in the 70% to 80% region, probably on balance, in the low 70s to mid-70s. That premium mix, based in the netbook sales as well. So that has both low end Vista and netbook sales in it. In terms of margins, it's a difficult one to answer because you've got the weighted average of lots of growth factors in there. Clearly, the realization that we get from netbooks are lower than what we traditionally get from the consumer segment. And to the extent that they are relatively high growth and it does impact our overall revenue per license. But to the extent that it is growth that we wouldn't otherwise have had and that's the phenomenon that I don't think any of us really know at this stage, how much of it is cannibalization of higher revenue per licenses and how much of it just simply new sales, then it's incremental sales, even though it drags down the average. So, clearly some of it is partially cannibalization, some of it is a new phenomenon. If you look at the price points of the some of the netbooks they are $300 to $400, clearly that is attractive for a lot of people in terms of adding a third or fourth PC to their homes. So it's not just transparents of higher end PCs as well. So it will affect the margins but some of that will be incremental growth that we wouldn't otherwise have had.\nHeather Bellini: So will we start thinking of this business like we do your overall operating profit as growth in operating income and Client are supposed to focusing on the absolute margin percentage?\nChris Liddell: Yeah, I think that's a good way of thinking about it, and what we really have now is quite different segments inside the PC market. It's becoming more interesting in that sense but you have quite different dynamics in the business market, the consumer, non-netbooks market, the consumer netbooks market and the emerging country version of all of those as well. Quite different growth rates, quite different realizations and quite different dynamics driving that. So it becomes, if you like more complicated from a forecasting point of view but a more interesting marketplace.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, thank you very much.\nChris Liddell: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Citi.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Chris, just on the operating margin side, can you just walk through some of the metrics you're putting in or procedures you're putting in to control the costs. I think you mentioned CapEx and headcount. Are you still on track to do $4 billion on CapEx this year and I guesses just from a headcount perspective I think you ended last year at 91,000 employees, up 15%. Do you expect to freeze or significantly slow that number.\nChris Liddell: On the CapEx side I would expect us to spend upwards of $300 million less than what we were anticipating, so we were talking about 4 before [237] and probably a better number at this stage. That will all be in the data sense side. We will probably also slow our growth in some of the facilities that we have the people just by virtue of not having as many people as were expected as well. But that's likely to be more of an FY '10 phenomenon. In terms of, sorry what was the second part of your question.\nBrent Thill: Just as it relates to headcount you ended the year at 91,000 heads, up 15%. Do you expect to heir or slow that pace?\nChris Liddell: I don't see any scenario where we'll grow by that much this year, by 15%. So it would certainly be less than that and it will be less than what we expect them to grow in the year coming into the year. So what we've done is, since we have gone right across the company, every division and looked at areas where we can if you like to have lower priorities spending taken out. So some of that is headcount growth that we might have otherwise had, some of its in marketing spend in areas where there's not the demand that we're expecting. Some of it's other, so it's non-people related costs, window spend, travel and things like that. So we're really cutting back on all of the areas which I consider as to I'll call it non-priority or low priority. In terms of where we might go further, you know we'll keep looking at those areas as the year develops. From my point of view, in terms of the margin structure, for our core business as a result of the cuts that we will see and what we would have otherwise spend, the margins for our core business overall will stay broadly flat year-on-year. Entertainment and devices always teach you to have their own dynamic, but all of those divisions will spend little less than what they would have otherwise.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Charlie DiBona with Sanford Bernstein.\nCharlie DiBona: Hi, Chris. I was wondering if we could turn maybe to unearneds here. They were down sequentially sort of by an unusually large amount from Q1 to Q4 and you're guiding to down sequentially next quarter which is different than your historic seasonality and even to regarding even to sort of a weak increase year-over-year by the end of the year. I understand there's an issue around undelivered elements also be sort of systemically coming down here. But even the VLA unearneds are down so its an unusual amount. How should we interpret this? What should we infer about your ability to sort of replenish those balances in this environment? And second as you are pulling those revenues down they should be extremely high margin. Maybe you can give us some light color on sort of what that means for controlling for that what apples-to-apples margins really look like?\nChris Liddell: Good question, Charlie. In terms of quarter one relative to quarter four it was down, that's certainly true, but obviously quarter four is a big billings quarter for us. So you would expect it to be down year-on-year, it's down about the same as what we would normally expect. During the course of the year in unearneds you've also got the Vista impact and undelivered elements. So you need to net that out to look at the unearned part that is not sister associated with that. So there is a couple of factors there that you need to build in. In terms of how we think about it going forward, and better than our guidance is clearly some sense that we will have a more difficult economic environment and that's going to have to feed into the billings overall. In the first quarter, interestingly, we continued our EA renewal rate of sort of traditional two-thirds or thereabouts. So the first quarter we saw very good. But there's just going to be pressure. All of our customers are clearly going to be looking for opportunities to cut costs and so also we're just being more cautious in terms of the rate at which we might have renewals or the rate at which we may sell to our new customers. Now all of that sales force, I sat in for half a day with our sales force yesterday going through area-by-area and segment-by-segment, all of them are committed to their budgets but you have to be realistic and say in this environment, we may not get the growth that we would have liked to have seen otherwise. So I'm just generally more cautious and that will feed through to our unearned over time. One of the benefits we have is in the areas like MBD and Server and Tools, about 40% of our revenue this year is from unearned coming through from last year. So it's going to be an FY '10 impact as much as an FY '09 impact that I'm concerned about Charlie, and as we get through the second quarter and get much more visibility into that I think we'll have to cut our costs for FY '10 depending on how we see the billings approach in the December period, which is much more significant and then also going into potentially into the June resignings as well. So it's an emerging issue. I don't see it that significant just at the moment. It's going to depend enormously on the environment that develops over the next three to six months and that's going to be an FY '10 sort of issue and upside, depending on where we get to.\nCharlie DiBona: And on the margin side, though, you're pulling this high revenue, these billings you're pulling them down a little faster than you did last year. Is that going to give you some cushion on the margin side?\nChris Liddell: I don't see if cushions the margin side. It will help give us an underpinning on the revenue growth and to the extent that that revenue is effectively 100% margin that's already paid. So, as it comes through, it's just revenue that's there. It will help us with, if you like, the underwriting the revenue. I don't see it as high margin, per se.\nCharlie DiBona: Thanks, Charlie.\nBill Koefoed: Let's move to the next question, please. Operator?\nOperator: Yes. And the next question comes from Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Good afternoon, everyone. Two quick ones. Chris, just on the margin, back to margins, I know you don't like to guide to a margin, but I think you made the comment that margin is broadly flat year-over-year, given the cost focus that you have. Why shouldn't Microsoft be thinking about margin expansion, just given your size, the fact we're going into a downturn, it really gives companies an ability to go back in and cut not just kind of semi discretionary, but really kind of cut back and think what a new operating model could look like with a slower top-line growth for a couple of years. And then just if I could, a follow-up on the EPS side, what buyback assumptions if any have you got within your EPS guidance as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think normally you say you don't want to give it, but it seems like there's not a lot in there just based on how the guidance stacks up.\nChris Liddell: Yes. The way that we spend and the way that our revenue is recognized, really are two quite separate trends and we have talked about this before. So, when I think about how much we should save, I think about it in the context of what are the opportunities to save against the expense base that we have. Not as against the revenue base that we have. So, the revenue are adjusted both in terms of the economic conditions that we think for this year. The expense base we've adjusted to try and retain margins as much as possible, but more against the opportunities set of where we can take expense out. In terms of our ability to expand margins in an environment like this, again, I would say that's an FY '10 and further. That's the sort of discussions that we have and the strategy reviews as opposed to how we run the business in the short-term. I made the comment in the commentary that I think we're making the right balance of taking cost out in the short term, but still investing for the future. As we start to put our forecasts for how we see the environment in fiscal year '10, '11 and so forth, then we have to start making some divisions about more structural change on the expense side as opposed to saving what we have already budgeted for this year. So, the two are clearly mathematically connected to each other but in terms of the way that we manage them are really quite separate. On buyback, as you know, we don't forecast about buybacks. We did $6 billion in the quarter. Clearly, we have a new authorization in place now, and we have the economic ability to continue the buybacks and share prices are certainly relatively attractive. But we don't forecast, what we will do in any one particular quarter.\nSarah Friar: Okay. I will get back in queue.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Sarah. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Two questions for you, Chris. One is looking at the cash flow statement there is an unusual deduction in current liability, and I was wondering if you could offer some perspective on that. Secondly, at a very high level, just doing some rough back of the envelope math here. Your revenue guidance now compared to where it was three months back is about 300 basis points lower and when I flow through that incremental impact at a 70%, 75% contribution margin, which is what I would expect given that most of your core business products are at that margin. I would expect that a lot of that negative impact to earnings can be offset through your share buybacks and even if you slowed down your pace of share buybacks to let's say 3 billion to 4 billion per quarter for the next three quarters. I would imagine the EPS impact, the negative EPS impact should be largely offset, yet we do have cautious guidance. You should completely understand and appreciate, given the economic environment. But I just wonder as I go through this tradeoff, if there is a little bit more cautiousness that is built in than what meets the eye. That's it. Thanks.\nChris Liddell: Okay. Fine. In terms of the unusual amount that you talked about, we did settle a past IRS exam for the years 2000 to 2003. So, that was a large one-off payment to the tax department. And it was actually lower than what we were expecting, and we recall that we released some of the provisions last quarter. So, that was the large payment that you're alluding to from a cash flow point of view. Secondly on the margin side, you are correct that buybacks will certainly offset some of the loss of margin that we have at an operating income level. One of the things that will dampen that, to some extent is the investment income that we have. We're more cautious in what we expect to get from our investment income line. You saw it was essentially zero for this quarter and it's just a difficult environment, clearly, to make high returns or any significant returns from our investment portfolio. So, that will offset a little bit of the buyback impact that you talked about. The other thing to point out is that as we lose sales and most of our businesses, last you applied our average margin, the marginal margin, if I can call it that, is probably higher than that. So, some of the sales that we have really are 90% plus, given the relatively low COGS associated with them. So if we lose revenue, our ability to take cost out in the short-term equal to that, to keep our margins intact, is very challenging. Now, we're looking to do that, and as I mentioned before in those three core businesses, I think we can retain margins year-over-year. But that's pretty difficult to make up from either cost reduction or from buyback overall. And it will certainly offset it and we have the benefit of both strong cash flow and a strong financial position which helps us. But I don't see it being a total offset.\nKash Rangan: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Next is John Difucci with JPMorgan.\nJohn Difucci: Thank you. Chris, you saw your Client revenue go up about 2% this quarter and your guidance is for 2% to 6% growth for the year. But you expect 7% to 10% for the December quarter, and you've talked about at the beginning of this quarter seeing some weakness overall, you didn't specifically mention this business. Just curious, though, what gives you the confidence in this 7% to 10% growth for this quarter?\nChris Liddell: It's really around as we go further out in the year we just get more uncertain. So, we've widened the range in particular in the back half of the year. So we think, particularly with Christmas coming up, that overall sales will be relatively good. We have reasonably good visibility into this quarter in terms of the inventory positions. We feel pretty good about some of the initiatives that we have in the unlicensed area. We've got channel inventory down to where we would like to see it. So, our visibility is better in this quarter than it is in some of the later quarters. So, it's simply as we go further out in the year, we just become more cautious.\nJohn Difucci: Okay. And if I might just a quick follow-up, I just wondered if there's any potential for any channel issues, Entertainment and Device really strong this quarter, but two years ago was really strong, and then later on we found out there was, that channel was over full, I guess. And I don't think it's related but you had a big jump in inventory on the balance sheet probably like over 60%. Are those two things related or can you just address those two?\nChris Liddell: Yeah. We are feeling good about the overall level of inventory going into the Christmas period. We had a strong sell-in quarter you're correct and we have got a reasonable amount of inventory on our balance sheet in terms of our own boxes. Having said that, the price points that we're looking at for this Christmas, at 199 for Arcade, 299 Pro, 399 Elite are very good. So none of us know exactly how, this economic situation is going to play out in terms of Christmas purchases. But when you look at those relative price points, either relative to our competition, sort of an absolute dollars relative to other things you people might purchase, it's nowhere near as significant as it was, say, last Christmas. So clearly, we don't know what Christmas will look like. But given our relative position, I think we're in pretty good shape from an inventory perspective.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, John.\nJohn Difucci: Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Good afternoon. I had a couple questions about currency. I believe a lot of your non-US business is actually billed in US dollars, like some of the OEM business and some of the emerging markets. Roughly, what percentage of your revenue, if you have a number, is actually in US dollars and what are your assumptions around currency for the rest of fiscal '09?\nChris Liddell: The easiest way to think about it is three, lots of one-third. About a third of our business is in US dollars in North America. About a third of our business is in US dollars, but sold in countries outside of the US. And about a third of our business is sold in international currency and countries outside of the US. So, you correct, a large part in particularly the OEM sales is for units that are sold outside the US, but we bill in US dollars. That's the easiest way of thinking about it. So, around a third is directly impacted by foreign exchange movements. In terms of the assumptions going forward, we are pretty much fully hedged for this year so regardless of the FX rate that you assume, the revenue guidance that we're giving is pretty solid, it won't change much depending on the currency. It will start to impact us more in fiscal year '10 as some of those hedges roll off. But we went into the year a 100% hedged and so at the moment we're benefiting from a lower exchange rate, in terms of those hedges being valuable.\nAdam Holt: Terrific. In fact if I could just ask a follow-up on the Office business. Obviously, good quarter in MBD with particular strength in the consumer side. Now the comparisons are easy for consumer for the next couple of quarters. You did mention some incentive programs this quarter. What are your expectations around the consumer growth and any further incentives there? Thanks.\nChris Liddell: That doesn't seem to certainly help drive growth in the first quarter. To the extent they're not evident or they're not in existence in the second quarter, we're more conservative, embedded in the guidance in MBD for the second quarter. We still think the overall customer proposition is very good, but we certainly saw a volume lift from some of those incentives in the first quarter. So, you're correct there. But we don't think it's going to be a significant phenomenon in the second quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Adam. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhillip Winslow: Hi, guys. Just had a question on the PC outlook for the rest of the fiscal year and Q4. I think you mentioned 10% to 12% year-over-year growth, so just your PC shipment expectations. Just kind of looking at what that is sequentially, that\u2019s about 10% to 12% sequential uplift, which is basically what we've seen in the past several December quarters. Just wondering what you see on the outlook there that gives you the confidence that we have a similar type of uplift heading into the December quarter here.\nChris Liddell: Sure, what I actually said was our outlook for the year is 8 to 12. So, I think I talked about 10 to 12 for the second quarter and 8 to 12 for the full year. Now, to the extent that the front half is around 10 to 12 and the year is 8 to 12, the implication just on simple average is that the back half of the year we're saying 6 to 12. So, that's a lot wider range and it's also on average lower. So, we are more cautious as the year goes on about not only the overall level of growth, but also the variability in that growth. So, if you take the average of that number, let's say 9% on the back half, that's a couple of points lower on average than the first half of the year and also with a much wider spread. So, we're pretty conservative on what the back half of the year might look like. And in particular, where the growth might come from. So, we think certainly netbooks growth will continue to be relatively robust, emerging markets will be. But in the back half of the year, we're feeling pretty cautious about in particular mature markets, core PC growth. That could be flat to single digits. That could be flat to single digit.\nPhillip Winslow: And then just for the December quarter, just with the Holiday season so forth, just the outlook heading into that, that's why I mentioned the 10% to 12%, sort of just what that implies sequentially?\nChris Liddell: Sorry, 10% to 12% for the December quarter. And that would be, again, single to mid-digits for the mature markets, solid double digits for the emerging markets and then probably about a five percentage point uplift as a result of netbooks. Is that the question you were asking?\nPhillip Winslow: That's perfect. Thank you.\nChris Liddell: Okay, great.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Phil. Operator, this will be our last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Israel Hernandez from Barclays Capital.\nIsrael Hernandez: Good afternoon, everyone. Chris, how should we be thinking about Microsoft's M&A strategy as we move through this down cycle? Do you see an opportunity to perhaps accelerate the pace as valuations come in? I'm not talking necessarily specifically around the Yahoo! situation, but its more generally with respect to enterprise software.\nChris Liddell: Clearly, the benefit this environment has to us, if there is one is in lower asset prices and we continue to be a net acquirer of businesses. Last year, as we bought around 24, so two a month. And we will continue to buy in particular in the sort of small or medium size businesses which are our real sweet spot. I see our real constraint is not being capital in that, but its simply our ability to integrate. So, I don't see us necessarily increasing the volume of acquisitions and in fact a lot of people will see this as a difficult time to sell, because they'll see their prices as being depressed. But to the extent that we do buy, which I think we'll continue then it's likely to cost us less than it would have otherwise. So generally, it's going to be a good environment for us and clearly relatively speaking we're still very cash rich. So, we are certainly not constrained from a capital point of view in buying companies. It's very much around, do they set the product road map and do we have the people and management capability to integrate them.\nIsrael Hernandez: Great, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Great. That will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft investor central website at www.microsoft.com/MSFT.\nChris Liddell: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to share with all of you our strong financial results. We achieved record revenue, operating income, and earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. This quarter, our strong revenue performance was both broad and deep, with every business achieving double-digit growth. Strong sales execution closed the year with fourth quarter bookings increasing 27%. For the year, both the Windows Division and Server and Tools Business achieved record revenue. We are equally enthusiastic about the customer and product momentum we\u2019ve achieved this year across the breadth of our portfolio. Of course, I have to start by noting Windows 7, which has received tremendous market response. With 175 million licenses sold to date, it is the fastest selling operating system ever and now runs on over 15% of all PCs worldwide. Capitalizing on the recovery of the server hardware market, Windows Server 2008 R2 has enjoyed strong demand and increased Windows Server market share. With the launches of Exchange 2010 and, most recently, SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010, we delivered key innovations in our productivity portfolio. Equally as important for our long-term growth, we made significant strides in our cloud initiatives by bringing Windows Azure to market and by increasing customer traction with our commercial online services. Throughout the year, we continued to update and enhance Bing, which has now achieved 13 consecutive months of market share growth. And finally, we focused on consumers with our new Xbox 360 consoles and the announcements of Kinect and Windows Phone 7, coming to market this holiday season. Meanwhile, as a result of our ongoing commitment to managing costs, we held annual operating expenses roughly flat. Our continued revenue strength and cost discipline drove yet another consecutive quarter of margin expansion and record annual profits in the Windows Division, Server and Tools Business, and Entertainment and Devices Division, as well as the company in total. We grew full-year operating income by almost $4 billion and generated operating cash flow of $24 billion. Of this amount, we returned about two-thirds, or almost $16 billion, to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. Finally, I\u2019m particularly pleased by our growth in earnings per share of 50% for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year. So, it\u2019s been a great fiscal year and an outstanding fourth quarter. With those remarks, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bill to provide more details on the quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. As I review this quarter\u2019s performance, keep in mind all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise. As Peter noted in his opening remarks, we finished the year with terrific financial results. Total revenue for the quarter grew 22% to over $16 billion, a record fourth quarter result. Windows, Online Services, Entertainment and Devices, Server and Tools, the Business Division, each of our operating segments grew revenue double digits this quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across all of our businesses. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income grew 49%, while EPS grew 50%. Looking at the full year and adjusting for the tech guarantees, we had four consecutive quarters of margin expansion with EPS growing faster than revenue every quarter. Operating cash flow was up 46% to a fourth-quarter record $5.6 billion. As for the year, operating cash flow surpassed $24 billion as Peter noted, also a record. Customer demand was strong across the breadth of the Microsoft portfolio this quarter, as we saw total bookings growth accelerate to 27%. In the enterprise, businesses continue to invest in and commit to the Microsoft platform. Sales execution and enterprise agreement renewal rates have improved as unearned revenue at the end of the quarter was $14.8 billion, up a very healthy 21% sequentially. The contracted not billed balance ended the year over a record $15 billion. The small and mid-market customer segment continued to experience robust growth and was up approximately 20%. Finally, continuing a trend this year, consumer demand was fantastic with growth in Windows, Office, Search, and Xbox. Geographically, we saw strength across all regions, led by emerging markets. Growth in the U.S. improved this quarter, while demand in Europe remained healthy. The PC market continues to thrive and we estimate the market grew between 22% and 24%, with both consumer and business growing in the same range. From a geographic perspective, emerging markets remain a significant driver of the PC market with almost twice the growth of mature markets. With that PC backdrop, I\u2019ll move on to the Windows and Windows Live Division. Windows revenue grew over a billion dollars or 32% this quarter when adjusted for the Windows tech guarantee last year. Total OEM license growth was 26% and outpaced the PC market for the third quarter in a row. Consumer and business licenses both grew approximately 26%. The business PC refresh cycle has accelerated and we recorded the second straight quarter of double-digit business license growth. As in past quarters, to help you bridge PC growth to OEM revenue growth, we have provided a reconciliation slide in our earnings deck. At 31% growth, adjusted Windows OEM revenue outgrew PC shipments by 7 percentage points this quarter. The hardware segment mix was a 3-point headwind to revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, emerging markets continue to outpace mature markets. Windows attach and inventory drove 6 percentage points of growth. We exited the quarter with normal inventory levels and continue to benefit from solid attach gains in both business and consumer. Finally, upsell and channel dynamics drove 7 percentage points of growth, reflecting a higher Windows 7 offering mix. Enterprise adoption of Windows 7 accelerated and the non-OEM portion of the Windows Division grew 36%, driven by an increase in volume licensing to businesses and retail sales of Windows 7. Clearly, the Windows franchise is thriving. Importantly, customer satisfaction for Windows 7 is incredibly high at 94% and businesses are deploying Window 7 in the enterprise. In the browser, IE 8 is now the fastest growing and most popular web-browser in the market, with IE 9 coming soon. Now let\u2019s move to Server and Tools which posted 14% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and had a record year with $14.9 billion of revenue. We estimate the underlying server hardware market grew 25% to 28%. Non-annuity revenue grew approximately 20%. Windows Server grew with the market, while SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio developer tools also contributed to the growth. Annuity revenue, which is approximately 50% of the business, grew about 15% with improved enterprise demand. From a product perspective, Windows Server, SQL Server, and System Center all experienced double-digit growth. Enterprise Services, about 20% of revenue, grew 3%. Windows Server continues to gain share as businesses replace and procure new hardware in the datacenter. We estimate Windows Server grew its market share over 1 percentage point while at the same time increasing premium mix to about 25%. Our virtualization suites almost doubled this quarter. In addition to the share gains in the traditional server market, Microsoft is leading the way to the cloud with our Windows Azure services platform. Just last week at the Worldwide Partner Conference, we unveiled a number of new cloud innovations and partnerships, further increasing the alignment between our on-premise Windows Server, SQL Server, and System Center products with the Azure platform. Next I\u2019ll move on the Online Services Division, which grew 13%. The Online advertising component of the division grew 19%, primarily driven by our search business, which again outperformed the market. We continue to be encouraged by Bing\u2019s ongoing share gains, due to the pace of exciting innovation and differentiation it brings to market. June marked the 13th consecutive month of share gains in the U.S., which is now up over 4 points since launch. Turning to the Microsoft Business Division, revenue grew 15% and Office 2010 is off to a great start. Consumer revenue, which includes OEM and retail, grew 51% following the launch of Office 2010, heading into the back-to-school season. The business portion of MBD grew 8%. Non-annuity license sales jumped 15%, trending towards PC shipment growth as expected. The annuity licensing portion of the business grew 6%, driven by an increase in enterprise demand. Office and the integration with SharePoint, Office Communications Server, and Dynamics CRM had strong demand and each of these products grew double digits this quarter. The cloud enhances these productivity scenarios, and our customers are purchasing suites of our online services at an increasing pace. 70% of our Business Productivity Online seats represent new business to Microsoft. Let\u2019s move on to the Entertainment and Devices Division which grew 27%. Gaming revenue grew 30% as we sold 1.5 million consoles, a unit increase of 26%, taking share as we grew faster than the overall market. Xbox Live continues to be a tremendous asset with over 25 million members. This year marked the first time that Xbox Live Digital Marketplace revenue exceeded subscription revenue, illustrating the service\u2019s increasing level of customer engagement and monetization. Non-gaming revenue was up 23%, driven by growth in Windows Embedded and sales of PC accessories that generally align to PC market growth. This quarter at E3, we unveiled Kinect, the Xbox 360 motion sensor which will enable you to play games, and control your music and movies with just your voice or the wave of your hand, no controller required. Earlier this week, we announced product and pricing for the all new Kinect experience. The Kinect experience, with more than 15 games available this holiday, begins in North America on November 4. Now, let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Foreign exchange had a 2% positive impact to revenue this quarter. We experienced a headwind from the euro as one would expect, but this was more than offset by our hedging program and the dollar weakening in other currencies. Cost of goods sold increased 23% to $3.2 billion, driven primarily by increased online costs, royalties, and other charges. Operating expenses were $6.9 billion in the quarter, under our guidance range, and we are very pleased with the Q4 execution and fiscal discipline. Headcount decreased 4% year-over-year. We repurchased $3.8 billion of shares and paid $1.1 billion of dividends. So, to wrap up, our product cycle momentum continues with the release of Office 2010 and the breadth of our portfolio which drove record results. Our cost discipline remains strong. In the cloud, we had great momentum and are seeing businesses invest in the Microsoft platform. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Peter, who\u2019s going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. I will now share our thoughts on the first quarter and total fiscal year 2011. We are entering the year with great momentum. We are encouraged by the resurgence in business PC shipments, and expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal year 2011. The recent refresh of our enterprise product has positioned us well to meet customers\u2019 needs as they return to investing in information technology. Turning to our outlook by business, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with PC shipments for the first quarter and full year, excluding the $7 million revenue impact from the Windows 7 retail launch and $276 million from the technology guarantee revenue carried over from fiscal year 2009. For the Microsoft business division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should continue to track with their PC shipment growth rates for the first quarter and full year. Annuity revenue for the first quarter and full year should grow low to mid-single digits. Moving to the Server and Tools business, in the first quarter we expect non-annuity revenue to be up mid to high-single digits as first-quarter bookings are sales cycle driven, and tend to be the softest seasonal quarter irrespective of hardware shipments. For the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue to generally track with the hardware market. We expect annuity revenue to grow roughly high single digits for the first quarter and full year. Enterprise services revenue should grow mid single digits. For the Online Services Division, our online advertising business should outperform the overall online advertising market. Regarding our search partnership with Yahoo!, we are working closely with them to migrate both algorithmic and pay traffic in North America to this holiday season. And finally, I will cover the Entertainment and Devices Division. Based upon the compelling wave of consumer offerings coming to market, we expect revenue will grow in the mid-teens for the first quarter and full year, following its normal seasonal skew to the first-half of the year. Moving to cost of goods sold, gross margins will be impacted by product mix, and particularly by the increase in hardware sales that will drive growth in the Entertainment and Devices Division. We remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and are lowering our full year operating expense guidance to between $26.9 billion and $27.3 billion, which includes our estimate of Yahoo! search integration expenses. We expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 25%. Switching to the balance sheet, we expect that the first quarter unearned revenue balance will track to normal historical patterns on a sequential basis, after adjusting for the impact of tech guarantees in the prior year. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 will be about $2.5 billion. This will be the second year in a row in which CapEx spending will be lower than depreciation expense. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. So in summary, I\u2019m very pleased by our outstanding financial results for the quarter and the full year. We have great product momentum in the market with strong business and consumer demand for our most recent wave of products. With the exciting pipeline of consumer products arriving to market this holiday season, we are well positioned to continue this momentum this coming year. On that note, I am looking forward to seeing all of you at our financial analyst meeting next week, and I will now return the call to Bill so that we can begin taking your questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Barb, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first is Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, I was wondering if you could elicit a little bit on the PC side your assumptions for fiscal \u201911, and just talk about tablets and how you are thinking about that market. Are you talking about growing in line with traditional PCs, and what impact do you think tablets will have on the market, and what maybe your share in that area and how does that affect your growth rate?\nPeter Klein: Yes. We are very excited about the market; the PC is the PC market excluding tablets. But obviously we are super happy with both the state of the PC market and the customer traction for Windows 7. You know, we think tablets are very interesting and remind us that there are always new scenarios and new opportunities, and we are constantly working with our partners and our OEM partners. In fact, I think one of the things that has driven the PC market and Windows growth this year has been the work we have done with our OEM partners on multiple scenarios and form factors and price points in all those. Tablets, I think, are interesting and great because I think they sort of enlarge the overall opportunity. I think they are additive to the opportunity, and again it reminds us that there are lots of interesting new scenarios that we are continuing to work on, and so we are excited by that.\nWalter Pritchard: Great, thanks.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Walter.\nBill Koefoed: Next question Barb.\nOperator: Next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Great. Thank you. It looks like an overly good start to Office, 8% business growth was the highest number I think you have seen in two years. Do you think business revenue growth can get to the same levels you saw with the previous Office cycle; we were each north of 20%. And why wouldn\u2019t the annuity business for Office grow faster the low single digits in the heart of the cycle next year? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Yes, thanks Adam. You know, I\u2019m not going to give guidance on business revenue rather than the driver framework that we gave. In terms of the annuity business, obviously this is in terms of the deferred revenue we had the last year, year and a half, has been slow and so we\u2019re kind of digging out of that hole, the recognitions that we have from the deferred revenue balance. And so in the course of this year, we will be building that backup. And as I said, we expect Q1 unearned revenue to also return to normal historical sequential pattern. So we feel good about the opportunity to continue to drive bookings with Office, but in terms of the annuity revenue recognized growth that is impacted by sort of the billings that we saw over the course of the last year, but having said that we are certainly very optimistic about business uptake of Office 2010.\nAdam Holt: Terrific, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, can you move to the next question?\nOperator: And next is Heather Bellini with ISI.\nHeather Bellini: Hi, yes, good afternoon. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the decline in the consumer premium mix, and what percentage of the decline is related to emerging markets and what are the other reasons if it doesn\u2019t explain all of it? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Heather, all of it. It is all related to the growth in emerging markets.\nHeather Bellini: That was easy then. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Yes, thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, next question please.\nOperator: And next is Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi, guys. Great quarter. I just wanted to have one question back on the windows division, if you look at that commercial and retail license line, it still remained very strong year-over-year and even sequentially. Obviously, in the first part of fiscal year that was driven by consumers upgrading to Windows 7, just what are you seeing there? Then also, as we start to think about fiscal \u201911, obviously that does include commercial licenses too, what would you expect for the impact of potentially enterprises upgrading to Windows 7 and sort of on top of I guess the PC replacement cycle. Thanks.\nPeter Klein: No, it is great. We are very optimistic about that opportunity, but remember it is a small part of the business, about 20% of the business. So, while there is great intent to deploy, and we are already seeing great deployment, so that is a little bit of a tailwind, but it is not by any stretch of imagination a material mover of the business, but it is a nice additive.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, next question please.\nOperator: Next is Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys, two questions. Just first, on the overall environment, you sound incredibly upbeat, you clearly had a very strong quarter, was there any shift as you got towards the end of the quarter, because clearly others through earnings have started to note more weakness in Europe, for example, our government spending. So we just love to get your perspective.\nPeter Klein: Yes, we didn\u2019t really see any differences throughout the quarter, and we are encouraged. We had strong demand and strong sales execution, and obviously, it did slightly better than we had hoped and talked about last quarter. For our products set though, we\u2019re thrilled with customers adopting our products. And there was really no difference throughout the quarter.\nSarah Friar: So, it sounds like with the product cycle, your kind of expectation is you can kick through even some slight decline on the macro side?\nPeter Klein: Yes, we certainly feel really good about the traction that our products had, no doubt.\nSarah Friar: Great. Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, next question please.\nOperator: And next is Brent Thill with UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter, you are continuing your strong expense discipline in the quarter, I am just curious if you could talk about fiscal \u201911, and what really changes as we go into next year to continue that discipline? You did take your expense guidance down a little relative to your past guidance, if you could just explain what drove that?\nPeter Klein: Yes, it is the same thing. This is an ongoing process, something we think about every day, and so continually as we go through we are always scrubbing. We are always looking at our plans, we\u2019re always looking to make the most effective use of the money, and as we have done that and we make progress, then we can lower our guidance, and that is just what we did. We did better in Q4 then we expected, and we are continuing to take that into next year, and we will just focus on that continuously.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Brent. Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next is Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: Hi, good afternoon. Your contracted but not billed balance was up 1.5 billion this quarter, can you tell us about that?\nPeter Klein: Yes. I mean, as we said it was strong bookings quarter all up, if you look at the revenue and the unearned and the CMB [ph]. You know, our bookings growth was 27%, and so it is reflective of the sales execution and the enterprise demand for our products, and it is interesting, Bill has kind of touched on that, it was very broad-based across geographies and across products and across customer segments and size. And so that is what is really driving that.\nKatherine Egbert: Will that continue to increase?\nPeter Klein: You know, I would just \u2013 we haven\u2019t given guidance on that. We did give the expectations on the unearned. So, I would take that as bit of a proxy for how things are going.\nKatherine Egbert: Okay, thanks Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Next question Barb.\nOperator: And next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Looking at the unearned balance for server and tools and MBD, it looks like it is back up to multi-quarter highs, and also your unearned metric which you reported is well above what it has been, the highest it has been in eight quarters. Yet, at the same time the guidance for the annuity and growth rate, it still sounds like we are in recession listening to your guidance for what seems to be low to mid single digits. Can you help us understand the disconnect here? It seems to me that you are being a little bit conservative with your annuity guidance for what seems to be two big product lines. Given the improvement in bookings off-balance sheet and on balance sheet, it occurs to me that as the deferred revenue starts to build up in your words, and there is normal seasonality that you should take your guidance up in the next few quarters. So, comments or reactions, an explanation would be appreciated. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Yes, what you are seeing Kash is the \u2013 it is the recognition next year, a function of the deferreds that we\u2019ve had. As you mentioned, this is the first quarter where we really pumped it up. So the recognitions in the annuity revenue that you are seeing next year in the reported number is a function of the challenges we had on our deferred balance. And so as we build that up over time, you will start to see the annuity business probably do better. So that is what you will see as you get towards the latter part of next year, because this is the first quarter where we really saw that unearned balance kick off.\nKash Rangan: So, if the deferreds continue to build up normal seasonality, should \u2013 we should expect you to take your guidance up for annuity growth rate in your two main businesses, right?\nPeter Klein: You know, it is too early to tell. You should just take the guidance that we gave as our guidance for FY11.\nKash Rangan: Okay, great. Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, next question please.\nOperator: Next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Hi guys. How are you?\nPeter Klein: Good.\nBrad Reback: So, Peter in the slides on 18, you talked about COGS being sort of negatively impacted next year, based on the expectation of mid-teen growth in E&D, can you give us any sense of what the headwind is on the COGS side?\nPeter Klein: Well, what I tried to do is give you the drivers, and I think, you know, you should go through your model, think about what assumptions you are going to make and clearly the assumptions, the biggest one that we like to call out that we think is most material by far is the growth in E&D and the headwind from the hardware sales, which is obviously a great thing for the long term, but in the short term will provide a headwind to COGS. And so, the reason we like to give you the drivers, it allows you the flexibility to kind of work that through your models as you come up with your product mix.\nBrad Reback: I understand, not to pick you, but you did put the mid-teen guidance out there, so based on that there is no way to give us any sense of what type of headwind that generates, so we\u2019re all on the same page here.\nPeter Klein: I will just say, Brad, do the math. And I think it will come out whatever your assumptions are for the driver framework. So, let us move on to the next question.\nOperator: And next is Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Peter, you know, we are in the mid of enterprise refresh and you know, premium mix for business edition has gone up from 28% to 29%, but if I look at the historical trend during the mid of enterprise refresh, actually you have been in mid to late 30s in terms of the business premium mix. You know, why it has only seen only 100 basis points improvement or is there a time maybe in the next few quarters where we can see it reaching to the historical level.\nPeter Klein: Yes, I would say, one, it is early in the refresh cycle. So, we should watch it. I think that really is the answer.\nBill Koefoed: Next question please Barb.\nOperator: And next is Ed Maguire from CLSA.\nEd Maguire: Yes, good afternoon. Last quarter, you provided some metrics around your online services subscription, can you provide some at least directional indications and help us understand as well some of the traction around Azure and how that may be impacting some of the traditional server revenues.\nPeter Klein: Yes, we talked about on the sort of commercial \u2013 the productivity online services as Bill talked about, you know, 70% of those wins have been competitive wins, which has just been really good. We\u2019re really accelerating the traction there. On the Azure side, it is early, we just launched that this year. The productivity online services are further along from a customer perspective, but we have really accelerated the developers and the users we have on the Azure platform. It is not material to the financials now, but we are really sort of establishing a leadership position in that of users. And we have had some \u2013 on the productivity side, we have had some great wins, we had the State of Kentucky, which was many, many \u2013 700,000 users. So, acceleration and continued progress and leadership in that.\nBill Koefoed: Next question please Barb.\nOperator: And next is Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you. Good afternoon guys. Just a follow up on Office 2010, qualitatively Peter, how are you thinking about consumer and enterprise adoption rates in the first 12 months or so post release as compared with the similar period, with regard to Office 2007?\nPeter Klein: Yes, you should just take the guidance that we gave you on the non-annuity side. We sort of expected to track PC shipments, which is a pretty strong result, especially given some mix of PCs to emerging markets where we have slightly lower cash. So we will \u2013 this quarter will be a big quarter, we'll look at the back-to-school and see how we are doing. But other than that, we are very excited \u2013 off to a great start; as you saw, the 51% number is a very strong number for early on.\nBill Koefoed: And Barb \u2013 Barb, let's move on. Let's make this the last question.\nOperator: And the last question comes from Rob Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRob Breza: Hi, thanks for sneaking me in. Just quickly, maybe as a follow-up to Gregg's question, as you look at the PC shipments, your expectations for Q1 are helpful. If we look at the trend kind of in the second half of the year, would it be natural to assume after back-to-school holiday season that we see a slight tail-off or can you just give us kind of maybe a front-half kind of second-half thought? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: We are not giving color on sort of half-by-half. The one thing I would say that will continue all year is that emerging markets will continue to grow faster than developed markets and that has an impact on our business.\nRob Breza: Great. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Rob.\nBill Koefoed: Okay. So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Financial Analyst Meeting next week where we will provide more details about our long-term strategies and provide you with a hands-on opportunity to experience our technology and engage in great discussions with our management team.

Our third quarter results reflect our strong product momentum, continued focus on controlling costs and the beginning stages of a return in business hardware spending. This quarter we generated record third quarter revenues and operating cash flow. In addition, as a result of revenue growth and our ongoing focus on cost management, when adjusting for the impact of the Tech Guarantee programs this year. We had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Strong demand for Windows 7 is a primary contributor to our performance. As evidence of that strong demand both internal and external checks show that over 10% of all PCs worldwide are already running Windows 7. While reaching this level of penetration in six months qualifies Windows 7 as our fastest selling operating system ever, it also illustrates how much opportunity still remains. As I have met with investors, I\u2019ve commented on the tremendous product momentum we have, which was evidenced this quarter across all our businesses. Bing achieved 10 consecutive months of market share growth since its launch and both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission cleared our search agreement with Yahoo! Azure, our cloud development platform became commercially available in 41 countries. In the mobile space, we announced Windows Phone 7 and Kin. At last Friday, we released Office 2010 to manufacturing and are looking forward to its launch in June. All of this was achieved while continuing to focus on managing costs and prioritizing our investments. As a result, we delivered operating income and earnings per share growth ahead of revenue growth with earnings per share of 36% over last year. We also returned $3.1 billion of cash to investors through dividends and stock repurchases. So in summary, I\u2019m pleased with our continuing performance this quarter. We had great momentum with current products in market. We have a very exciting pipeline of new products to come and we continued to deliver strong financial results. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Bill to give you some additional details on the quarter and then come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. As I review this quarter\u2019s performance, keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise. As Peter said, we had another strong quarter. Overall, GAAP revenue grew 6% to $14.5 billion. During the quarter we deferred $305 million of revenue related to the Microsoft Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. Adjusting for this amount, revenue would have been $14.8 billion, 8% growth over the prior year period. GAAP operating income grew 17% year-over-year, while EPS grew 36%. Operating cash flow this quarter was $7.4 billion, an all time record for the company. Foreign exchange had a positive impact to revenue of about $200 million this quarter. In terms of overall revenue mix, geographically emerging markets grew more than 20%, while mature markets grew mid single digits. While consumer demand continued to be strong, we saw renewed strength from small and mid-market customers with year-over-year growth of more than 15%. Within the enterprise customer segment, we saw the beginning of a recovery in IT hardware spend but as we\u2019ve discussed on past calls, we continued to see lengthened sales cycles. Enterprise agreement renewal rates, taking into consideration the extended sales cycles are within our historical range. Unearned revenue was $12.3 billion, down sequentially as is typical, but better than last year\u2019s seasonal trend and roughly flat year-over-year. Our unearned revenue balance would have been up more than $100 million or 1% year-over-year when considering the recognition of undelivered elements, primarily associated with our prior Windows XP sales and the revenue deferral from our Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. Multiyear annuity billings were up mid single digits year-over-year. This quarter\u2019s growth from volume licensing is beginning to offset the unearned revenue declines we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters as we rebuild our unearned balance. Now for the PC market. Windows 7 and innovation from our OEM partners continued to fuel demand for PCs. We estimate the PC market grew roughly 25% year-over-year. Within that, we estimate consumer PCs grew almost 30%, while business PCs grew 14%. This quarter netbooks represented approximately 10% of the total PC market. Let\u2019s move on to this quarter\u2019s performance by business group, beginning with Windows & Windows Live division, which had another exceptional quarter. We continued to see very strong consumer demand for Windows, with consumer license growth up 35%. We also saw a return in demand for business PCs with licenses up more than 15%, leading us to believe the business PC refresh cycle has begun. OEM units increased 30% year-over-year and outpaced PC shipments. OEM revenue increased 29% for the second quarter in a row and also outpaced the PC market. As with prior quarters, we have included a slide that bridges the difference between the PC market growth and OEM revenue growth. We experienced on 9 percentage point headwind, primarily caused by emerging markets outpacing mature markets and consumer outpacing business. Windows attach and inventory drove 8 percentage points of OEM revenue growth. Conditions from the prior quarter remained largely unchanged with inventory exiting the quarter at normal levels. Windows 7 up sell and channel dynamics drove 5 percentage points of OEM revenue growth, reflecting adoption of Windows 7 on netbooks and adoption of premium versions of Windows 7 on business and consumer PCs. The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows division grew 26%, primarily driven by retail sales of Windows 7. Now let\u2019s move to server and tools. We estimate server hardware shipments strengthened considerably with year-over-year growth in the high teens. The OEM and license-only revenue, which represents 30% of the business, grew high single digits, an improvement from prior quarters. Within that, Windows Server revenue grew mid-teens, while SQL Server and developer tools experienced slower growth in front of new product launches. Annuity revenue, which is approximately 50% of the business was roughly flat. Enterprise services grew 5%. Our virtualization solutions continue to be strong. system center server revenue grew over 20% and Windows Server Premium mix remains over 20% this year. Additionally, our share of new x86 virtualization licenses, which includes Hyper-V and Virtual Server, is now 25%, up 3 points year-over-year in the December quarter according to IDC. We released to manufacturing Digital Studio 2010, announced a new partnership with Citrix that furthers our desktop virtualization offering and yesterday, we released to manufacturing SQL Server 2008 R2. Clearly there is very strong product pipeline in server and tools. Now for the online services division, online advertising revenue grew 19%, primarily driven by search, which outperforms the market. We continue to be enthused with Bing\u2019s momentum, which includes 10 consecutive months of share gains in the U.S. We ended the quarter with U.S. query share of 11.7%, according to comScore, 340 basis points higher than when we launched Bing last May. The Yahoo search partnership implementation is underway and we\u2019re working toward U.S. completion by the end of this calendar year and global completion by early calendar year 2012. Moving on to the Microsoft business division. In general, the conditions from last quarter remain unchanged. Revenue was down 6% but when adjusted for the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee deferral of $305 million, revenue was up 1%. Within MBD business revenue was down 1%. As we have discussed previously, the non-annuity component of business revenue has been pressured in advance of the next product cycle, while annuity revenue was roughly flat. Consumer revenue, which includes the OEM and retail portions of this business, increased 11% when adjusting for the Technology Guarantee and was primarily due to strong PC shipments. Last Friday we released to manufacturing Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010. We expect commercial availability in May with general availability in June. With respect to the $305 million Tech Guarantee deferral, it\u2019s important to note that due to varying international availability and fulfillment dates, there will be puts and takes to the unearned revenue balance throughout Q4. However, the Tech Guarantee deferral balance is expected to remain roughly unchanged at the end of Q4. We expect that substantially all of the Tech Guarantee unearned revenue balance will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. During the quarter we made terrific progress in our cloud offering. Customers such as Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, GlaxoSmithKline, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Aviva and Swedish Red Cross are all going to the cloud with Microsoft. We now have 40 million paid seats of our commercial online services. Clearly companies are choosing Microsoft for their cloud productivity solutions and we intend to build on this momentum. Now let\u2019s move on to the entertainment and devices division. Gaming revenue declined 4%, as we sold 1.5 million consoles, a unit decline of 12%, which was roughly in line with the overall market. While our software attach rate continued to lead the industry at $8.8, first party software revenue declined based on difficult comparisons to the prior year launch of Halo Wars. This was substantially offset by the continuing strong revenue and membership growth of Xbox LIVE. Non-gaming revenue was up 14%, reflecting growth in the PC hardware market and increased Windows embedded revenue. As Peter mentioned, we continued to have good momentum on the product side for mobile. During the quarter we announced Windows Phone 7 and last week we announced Kin, which will be available in the U.S. in May. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold decreased 2% to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by lower Xbox 360 volume and console costs. These savings were partially offset by increased traffic acquisition and online costs. Operating expenses were $6.6 billion, as we continued to manage our expenses and prioritize our investment. Headcount declined both year-over-year and sequentially. D&A expenses grew due to contractual costs associated with our Yahoo search partnership and legal expenses. We repurchased $2 billion worth of shares and paid $1.1 billion of dividends. So to wrap up, the consumer segment continued to drive great results. In addition, we saw the beginning of the business PC refresh. This combined with our strong product pipeline and our continued focus on execution and cost management, means we\u2019re well-positioned for the future. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Peter, who is going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Bill. Now I\u2019ll discuss our expectations for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter to be similar to the third quarter with continued strength in hardware shipments. We were encouraged by the recent uptick in business PC growth and expect that this business refresh cycle will continue over a couple of years. Before I get into my commentary by division, remember that the June quarter is the close of our fiscal year. As such, it is historically a seasonal high for our enterprise sales and we\u2019re entering it with a strong sales pipeline. While we\u2019ve noted early signs of improvement, the business spending environment and associated sales cycles remained challenging. We will be very focused on closing deals during the quarter and we expect that unearned revenue will likely return to normal seasonal patterns. Beginning with the Windows division, we expect revenue to grow slightly faster than the overall PC market in the fourth quarter. Attach, inventory and premium mix gain should more than offset macro trends particularly that of the emerging markets growing faster than mature markets. Turning to the Microsoft business division, we\u2019re very excited about the launch of Office 2010 this June, as it will provide the best productivity experienced across the PC, phone and browser. The combination of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, Exchange 2010 and Office Communications Server will be the practical platform for IT, delivering anywhere access to your document and unmatched collaboration. For the fourth quarter, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should track towards PC shipment growth, while we expect annuity revenue to be up low single digits. The server and tools business generally aligns with server hardware shipments and business IT spending. Similar to many observers, we expect server shipments to show healthy year-over-year growth. In the fourth quarter we expect that non-annuity revenue should move generally in line with hardware shipments. Annuity revenue should grow mid single digits, while enterprise services revenue should grow low single digits. For the online services division, the outlook for online advertising appears to be improving and we expect the trends from the third quarter to continue. Excluding the impact of our legacy access business, revenue should be in line with or better than the market for the fourth quarter. In the entertainment and devices division, we maintain our view expressed last earnings call that full year revenue should be roughly flat relative to the prior year. This translates into a fairly robust growth rate for the fourth quarter, driven by the uplift from the strong PC market, increased gaming attach revenue and momentum in Windows embedded. Switching to costs, we continued to make good progress containing our cost of goods sold, despite the upward pressures of increased traffic acquisition costs in our search business and growth of our online services. As a result of our operational initiatives, improved Xbox 360 console costs and a continuing favorable revenue mix, we now expect full year gross margin to expand 1%, compared to the prior year. With regard to operating expenses, we remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and aligning resources to key priority. For the full year, we\u2019re lowering our operating expense guidance now expected to be between $26.1 billion and $26.3 billion. We estimate that our capital spending for the year will be no more than $2 billion and our effective tax rate should be approximately 25% for both the quarter and the year. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and will return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the long run -- the amount of repurchases may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Now I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes looking ahead at fiscal year 2011, with more details to follow at our financial analyst meeting in July. From a macro perspective, we expect the business refresh cycle that I referenced earlier will continue through fiscal year 2011. This combined with strong momentum from Windows 7 and the launches of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2, will be significant revenue drivers for our core businesses. Switching to online, we expect the online advertising market to be better than fiscal year 2010. Our business should continue to grow faster than the market, excluding our legacy access business, which will be less of a headwind as it becomes a smaller portion of the mix. We expect our partnership with Yahoo will begin to contribute to our revenue the second half of that fiscal year. Lastly, the entertainment and devices division will be introducing an unprecedented wave of innovation in the first half of the year, including (inaudible) and its launch title, as well as Halo Reach, (inaudible) and Windows Phone 7. Now moving to cost of goods sold. It\u2019s important to consider the shift of revenue mix across software, services and hardware. While there are a number of factors to weigh for next year, the single largest variable driving cost of goods sold will be hardware demand in the Xbox business. Additionally, we will continue to pursue operational efficiency, as we have throughout this year. Switching to operating expenses, we\u2019re currently working through our budgeting process and maintain our outlook of $27.0 billion to $27.5 billion. All of this will allow us to continue to generate exceptional operating cash flow, which we will continue to return to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. So in summary, we delivered very good financial results for the quarter with strong demand for Windows 7 driving revenue growth and solid cost management enabling operating income and earnings per share to grow even faster. As we look forward, we\u2019re encouraged by improving market conditions taking shape as we continue to launch our strongest wave of products in the company\u2019s history. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill and answer some of your questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible. So please stick to one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Barb, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first is Heather Bellini with ISI.\nHeather Bellini: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about your comment about a return to normal seasonality in unearned revenue. I guess, what I\u2019m wondering -- had the Tech Guarantee benefit Q3 deferred. So when we\u2019re looking if normal seasonality were to happen in Q4, are we taking the Q3 ending balance and thinking about it that way or should we be thinking about adjustments for the Tech Guarantee? Thank you.\nBill Koefoed: Yeah. Take it as it is.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you very much.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Heather.\nOperator: Next is Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi. Could you guys talk about on the server side, it looks like non-annuity revenue grew a little bit slower than server units and I guess, you\u2019re seeing an uplift in version mix there, which should be helping the situation. Just curious to get some more detail on that as well as what you think we should see looking forward into June and beyond?\nPeter Klein: Yeah. You have to break it down, I think, you have to break it down into its components. There\u2019s actually two pieces of the non-annuity business of the transactional business, the Windows Server piece and then the other pieces of the business. The Windows Server non-annuity piece actually grew a mid-teens, so tracked towards the hardware market. The other products, things like SQL Server and Visual Studio grew slower than that in anticipation of a product release [account]. So it tends to be less correlated particularly in quarters where there is a significant growth year-very-year. So that was the issue there. In terms of looking forward, I think we gave the guidance on what we expect for the transactional business, particularly as we launch Visual Studio and SQL Server tracking more towards the server hardware market.\nWalter Pritchard: Great. Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Yeah.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, can you ask next question.\nOperator: Next is Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Terrific. Thank you. My question is about Office. As we near the release, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you\u2019re thinking about what the impact should be, what you think about with respect to the average selling price opportunity on Office? And in particular also, you mentioned transactional revenue for the next quarter. Should we assume that transactional revenue continues to accelerate as we get deeper into the Office cycle? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Yeah. Let me get your last question first. Certainly as we\u2019ve said, we expect the largest part of the impact from the launch actually to happen in fiscal year \u201811. So typically what you\u2019d see, since we\u2019re launching it in the May, June timeframe, typically what you\u2019d see is several quarters after that the impact of that. So you should see that in the first half of fiscal year \u201811. It terms of average selling price, it\u2019s a little hard to talk about that now. It\u2019s going to be a function of obviously mix but I would just think about it the way the Office 2007 launches. The one thing I would add to that, where you will see it is in the platform side of the business. So when you see the Enterprise CAL and how we monetize the enterprise versions of the productivity infrastructure for SharePoint on Exchange is where you\u2019ll see opportunities for overall revenue growth from an ASP perspective, for an (inaudible).\nAdam Holt: Terrific. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Adam.\nBill Koefoed: Barb.\nOperator: And next question is from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, on the cost side, I mean, you highlighted this great expansion that you\u2019ve seen as you\u2019ve -- you\u2019re starting to read the benefits of those cost controls that you took a few about a year ago. As you look out to Q4, your guidance would suggest actually a sequential decline in the operating margin and yet you should be hitting, pretty strong product cycles still on Windows and Office beginning to come into the mix. Why wouldn\u2019t we get more margin expansion in Q4? And then as you look at fiscal \u201811 costs, what are the puts and takes of why costs go up versus what other measures you can do to keep them down?\nPeter Klein: Yeah. The biggest thing driving the Q4 expenses is revenue driven expenses that are associated with primarily our enterprise annuity business, which are going to be up, fair amount both sequentially and year-over-year and so that\u2019s the biggest thing you\u2019ll see in Q4. The other thing you\u2019ll see in Q4 is, as I talked about, the wave of product launches that we\u2019ve got coming, including Office 2010 and SQL Server. So it\u2019s just, what\u2019s happening this quarter is sort of, not unique but those are the things that are really driving what you\u2019re seeing in Q4. And of course, those have been embedded in our guidance all year long and the fact of the matter is we\u2019ve been -- we try to manage our costs in such way as possible and bring it down whenever we can, which we did this quarter. The dynamics in FY \u201811, as you note there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes and we\u2019re always prioritizing and aligning our investments. But all up, you should think the things that are driving it are similar. There\u2019s some revenue driven as we continue to grow revenue and there\u2019s also some sales and marketing associated with some key launches that we will have, particularly in the first half of the year related to the consumer businesses like Natal and phone. And I would say, keep in mind that is a pretty measured increase of only 3% to 5% for the full year.\nSarah Friar: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.\nPeter Klein: Yeah. Thanks Sarah. Barb?\nOperator: And next is Brent Thill with UBS.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Peter, considering the strength of the product cycle and the uptick we\u2019re seeing in corporate spend. It\u2019s still surprising to hear about lengthening sales cycles and I think the unearned was below the Street estimates. What are customers citing the reasons why they are not pre-signing up? Are they just waiting for all these products to be launched before they\u2019re renewing or are they trying to get our hands around what you\u2019re hearing from the customer base.\nPeter Klein: Yeah. There\u2019s a couple of things. One that is true, particularly when there is so many products that are launching. So there\u2019s a bunch of revenue that\u2019s going to come through on the non-annuity side that people are waiting for launches for. And I do think that hardware, if you think about what\u2019s happened over the last year. The first thing that got hit and decreased earliest and fastest was hardware and that\u2019s what\u2019s coming back first. And I think that over time, as we\u2019ve been saying and I think most other people are saying, over the course of calendar 2010 and certainly into 2011, you\u2019ll start to see the growth in the overall IT spend. For us in particular, from a sales cycle perspective, Q4 is just seasonally our biggest quarter. And so when you combine sort of the sales cycle and the product cycle, kind of converging on Q4 and beyond, as well as where we\u2019re I think in the stage of what businesses are doing in terms of first refreshing their hardware that kind of converges over the next two or three quarters probably.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nBill Koefoed: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next is John DiFucci with JP Morgan.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Peter, I have a question on the Windows business. It looks like on slide 11 you\u2019ve got about 8% benefit from the Windows attach and inventory. And I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s from less piracy and then inventory build in the channel. You also got about, I think it was 10% last quarter. Now this is the second quarter into a new launch of Windows 7. I\u2019m just curious, I mean, how sustainable is that? I would assume that piracy is going to be less during a launch even pirates have to buy legitimate copies at least for a while. And then also the inventory build in the OEM channel, I assume that would start to wane. If that happens, would you expect that benefit to start to wane here and if it does, should we be thinking that the segment mix line up above that with a corporate refresh cycle that sounds like it\u2019s going to happen in the second half, that should start, you\u2019d start to see less of a negative hit in that line or how should we be thinking about this?\nPeter Klein: Well, it\u2019s a great question. You\u2019re thinking about all of the right components of it and certainly, attach and piracy are always going to sort of cycle up and down depending on where you are. We\u2019re working through this year sort of a work-down of the inventory from last year and we\u2019re still working that. We\u2019re at sort of normal inventory levels. That\u2019s been a good year-over-year thing for us and attach, correct, is -- part of that is piracy related to the launch of Windows 7. All those things so we\u2019ve given you specific color for Q4, what to expect for the OEM business relative to the PC business.\nBill Koefoed: Sorry. Can I just add one thing?\nPeter Klein: Yeah.\nBill Koefoed: The other thing is just there is an overall, I think we talked about it on prior calls, an overall secular change, which is the multinational OEMs are becoming a more significant portion of the total PC market. And that\u2019s says good things for our attach relative to the prior mix of our revenue -- from different PC manufacturers, and...\nJohn DiFucci: So, and I\u2019m sorry, just to, does that mean that you\u2019re seeing a little less piracy and you expect to see that in some international markets?\nPeter Klein: We\u2019re seeing that globally.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Thanks John.\nOperator: Next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, guys. Good quarter. Peter, you guys have talked about in the last few quarters seeing a pretty significant uplift in Windows revenue from the retail channel, some consumers going out to the store to upgrade to Windows 7. When you compare what you believe is sort of the corporate upgrade opportunity to be to what you\u2019ve seen over the past couple of quarters to consumer, which one is the larger of the two? And when would you expect to see the corporate side begin? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Well, just in sheer numbers in terms of PC shipments, the consumer is a lot bigger than the business segment. Now, the impact you get from the business segment obviously is some ASP uplift. We\u2019re starting to and you get the corporate refresh in two ways. You can get sort of volume licensing upgrades or you can get it OEM when they buy the PCs, which is the largest piece of the revenue. And that\u2019s what we started to see happen and you saw some of that impact this quarter with business PC shipments up 14%. That\u2019s the sort of this is sort of the shape of the opportunity going forward as that continues and you can see that has an uplift on our OEM revenue relative to the overall PC market.\nBill Koefoed: Next question, Barb.\nOperator: Next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted you to talk a little bit more about the deferred revenue trajectory going into Q4. It looks like, this year compared to the start of the year deferred revenue long-term or short-term is down a lot more than what it has been the past few fiscal years, so that would argue for a bigger than seasonal catch-up in Q4. So maybe you could talk about what is embedded in your expectations and what do you expect on the ELA side. And also, I think you\u2019ve talked about book but not build portion of your bookings. So if you can just give us some color on how that is shaping up that would be great? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Yeah. Just in terms of the numbers, what we sort of the guidance that we said. It\u2019s we\u2019re looking for sequential increase in Q4 in a similar range that you\u2019ve seen over the last three, four, five years sequential growth. We\u2019re starting to rebuild the balance. You started to see that happen a little bit in Q3 with our multiyear annuity billing having positive growth. So I think that\u2019s sort of the essence of what we\u2019re expecting and what we\u2019re guiding to. What was your second question?\nKash Rangan: The book but not build portion on the balance, you would talk about that in your presentations in prior times, but just noted that we\u2019ve not been talking about that in recent times, just wondering if you have an update there?\nPeter Klein: You know, I think, that\u2019s actually a good thing that we\u2019ll talk about in July on the Q4 call, just because it\u2019s such a bigger issue, the seasonality in terms of our bookings in Q4 is so much more material than in Q3. I think that\u2019s when we will talk about that.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, next question.\nOperator: Next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Hey, guys. How are you?\nPeter Klein: Good. How are you?\nBrad Reback: Good. So Peter, just switching gears back to server and tools, as I look back at my notes from last quarter, I think you guys talked about the annuity business being up mid single digits and I think it came in flat this quarter. Given my understanding that most of that is coming off the balance sheet, what would have caused that delta in that three months period?\nPeter Klein: Yeah. I think, the comment was for H2 not for Q3 up mid single digits. And so if you look at our guidance again with the seasonality of our sales cycle most of that comes from Q4, which was in our guidance that we gave today.\nBrad Reback: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Brad.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks. Barb, next question.\nOperator: And next is Katherine Egbert with Jefferies & Company.\nKatherine Egbert: Hi. Thanks. Speaking of guidance, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts right now, multiple product cycles, revenue deferrals and economic recovery. What are you looking for to become comfortable with providing more specific guidance? What are the triggers?\nPeter Klein: Well, I\u2019m not sure there are specific triggers. I actually having a driver framework and having a really good qualitative discussion about all the factors that drive it, is actually a great way to talk about the outlook and the environment what we\u2019re seeing for our businesses. And so, I think, there\u2019s no specific triggers that are going to change that. I think the dialogue that we\u2019re having around these drivers and the framework is great.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question.\nKatherine Egbert: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next is Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks Peter. You talked about next year gross margins obviously having an impact from the hardware cycle. In the past at times you\u2019ve talked about as you change to more cloud computing that taking a hit as well. Can you give us any range and could we see as much as 2 percentage points in change there next year?\nPeter Klein: You know, we\u2019re not giving a range on that now. We\u2019ll definitely talk about that at the financial analyst meeting in July.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question.\nOperator: And next is Rob Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRob Breza: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Peter, just maybe as a follow-up to Brendan\u2019s question, you called out in your prepared remarks the 40 million paid seats for the cloud initiative. I was wondering if you could talk about where you\u2019re seeing the strength there and how we might expect that to be 12 months from now? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Yeah. We\u2019re seeing strength across a variety of our areas. You heard Bill talk about all the great customers we have our commercial online services like SharePoint and Online and Exchange Online. That\u2019s obviously a big growth area for us. The 40 million comes from things like Live Meeting and Exchange Hosted Services and CRM Online. And so what you\u2019re seeing is really part of our strategy. So the broadest array of commercial services for businesses of all sizes. Some of these are really aimed more at mid-market customers. Some are aimed more at big enterprise customers and we\u2019re getting growth from both. And then the last thing that we sort of touched on but didn\u2019t talk about in great detail was Azure, which is now available in 41 countries and what that will do really over the next couple of years.\nBill Koefoed: Barb, we\u2019ve got time for just one more question.\nOperator: Okay. The last question comes from Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.\nTim Klasell: Yeah. Good afternoon, everybody. A question about the Windows 7 upgrade cycle, it appears to us that a lot of customers are going to attach a Windows 7 upgrade with maybe a Server 2008 R2 upgrade. Are you sensing that and could that maybe delay the Windows 7 upgrade cycle a little bit more than we normally would but have the positive impact of pulling along some server sales as well?\nPeter Klein: You know, we really haven\u2019t seen that at all, as a matter of fact when we talk to our enterprise customers, there\u2019s a high degree of intent to deploy Windows 7 as soon as possible. There\u2019s a, many, many, high percentage our customers are already either in pilot or pre-launch mode for deploying Windows 7. So, I think, we haven\u2019t seen that as a phenomenon at all, people waiting for Windows 7. In fact we see the opposite that people are deploying it rather quickly.\nTim Klasell: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Thanks. Okay. So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft Investor Relations website at microsoft.com/msft. Please keep in mind that we will be in a number of conferences in the next couple of months. We\u2019ll be at the JP Morgan Conference in May, the Banc of America/Merrill Lynch Conference, the Cowen Conference, the RBC and UBS Conferences in June. In addition, we will be previewing Natal at E3 in LA in June. Please contact Microsoft Investor Relations if you need additional details. We hope to see you there. Thanks again for joining us and have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s call.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nBill Koefoed: Thank you, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Peter Klein to his first earnings call as Microsoft\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. Today Peter will start with takeaways from the second quarter of our 2010 fiscal year. Then I will get into the details of the quarter before handing it back to Peter, who will discuss our business outlook. After that, we will take your questions. We filed our Form 10-Q this afternoon. In addition we posted our quarterly financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow the flow of our prepared remarks, as well as provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Okay, Peter, it is all yours.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to be joining you for my first earnings call. I have met with many of you over the last two months and during my prior roles at Microsoft and I look forward to spending time with many more of you in the months ahead. Over the course of my career both inside and outside of Microsoft, in good economies and bad, I have learned that there are a few constants that persistently translate to success; working with great people and relentlessly focusing in creative value for customers, employees and shareholders. I am delighted to have the opportunity to do that in my new role, building on our current momentum and driving future growth. Now let me share some thoughts on our second quarter results. We reported record revenue and record profits. These results were driven in large part by strong consumer demand for Windows 7 and PCs. While consumer demand remains healthy, we have not seen a return of enterprise spending growth. Meanwhile our ongoing work in managing expenses and aligning our cost structure to the highest priorities has enabled us to drive earnings growth ahead of revenue growth. We also returned $4.8 billion of cash to investors through dividends and stock repurchases. As we have previously discussed, we are just starting our strongest product cycle ever. This quarter was highlighted by the successful launches of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Exchange 2010. We released Office 2010 to beta and introduced more Bing innovations this quarter. Bing has now gained market share each month since its launch. We also announced upcoming releases of two very important and compelling offerings that will drive growth into the future, Windows Azure and Natal. Azure is our cloud platform which is providing developers, partners and our customers a smooth transition to the cloud with tools and processes they already know. Natal, which is based on our natural user interface work, will energize this generation\u2019s gaming and entertainment experience starting this coming holiday season. So in summary, I am very pleased with our progress this quarter. We have momentum with products and markets. We have an exciting pipeline of new products and we delivered strong financial results. I will now hand the call back to Bill to give you some additional details on the quarter and then come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. I will start with the company overview and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. I will then review the rest of the income statement. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise. As Peter mentioned, we had an exceptional quarter with record revenue and profit. Overall revenue grew 14% to just over $19 billion, primarily driven by strong Windows 7 consumer demand. Net income and earnings per share were $6.7 billion and $0.74 respectively. Excluding the $1.7 billion of revenue recognized from the Windows 7 upgrade program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability, revenue grew 4%. Foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Our product billing mix in the second quarter was roughly the same as last year with 30% annuity, 30% OEM and 25% license only with the balance coming from our other businesses. Now let me dive deeper into the overall revenue mix. Geographically emerging markets grew mid teens while mature markets grew single digits. In terms of segments, consumer demand continued to be the driver of growth. While we saw stabilization in the business segment, as Peter mentioned, we have not seen a return of enterprise spending growth to date. Enterprise agreement sales cycles have lengthened and multi-year annuity revenue was flat year-over-year. Unearned revenue was $12.5 billion, down slightly from last year. On a sequential basis, unearned revenue was down primarily due to this quarter\u2019s recognition of the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 revenue that I referred to earlier. Our contracted not billed balance was approximately $13 billion, down slightly from last year. Now for the PC market. PC hardware shipments grew substantially during the quarter fueled by demand for Windows 7 and innovation from our OEM partners. The combination of Windows 7 and the unprecedented variety of hardware choices, form factors and price points makes it a terrific time for customers to get exactly the PC they want. Year-over-year, we estimate that PC market grew 15 to17%. More specifically we estimate consumer PCs grew more than 20% while business PCs were roughly flat. This quarter netbooks represented about 11% of the total PC market, roughly flat compared with last year and last quarter. Now with that backdrop, let\u2019s move onto revenue and business drivers by segment, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live division which I will refer to as the Windows Division. All of my comments related to the Windows Division are adjusted to exclude the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 revenue I referred to earlier. Keep in mind this is a non-GAAP view and all GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our slide deck which is posted on our website. Overall, the Windows Division had a phenomenal quarter with record quarterly revenue of $5.2 billion, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was mainly driven by increased OEM unit sales of 22%. OEM revenue increased 21% and grew faster than PC shipments for the first time in eight quarters. As in the prior quarter, we have included a slide that bridges the difference between the PC market growth and OEM revenue growth. Changes in segment mix represented a nine percentage point headwind to OEM revenue. This was caused by two factors; a higher mix of consumer PCs than business PCs and emerging markets outpacing mature markets. Windows attach and inventory drove 10 percentage points of OEM revenue growth. Attach accounted for about half the increase. Year-to-date, we saw solid attach gains across all regions, channels and form factors. Inventory accounting for the other half of the increase was a result of OEMs rebuilding inventory to exit the quarter at normal levels as we discussed in last quarter\u2019s call. Windows 7 up sell and channel dynamics drove six percentage points of OEM revenue growth reflecting consumer demand for Windows 7 Home Premium and demand for Windows 7 on netbooks. The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows Division grew 55% primarily driven by the retail launch sale of Windows 7. Now let me give you some additional Windows data points. Through the end of the second quarter, we sold more than 60 million Windows 7 licenses, making it the fastest selling operating system in history. Windows is attached to more than 90% of netbooks with Windows 7 accounting for well over half of that. Windows consumer licenses grew more than 35% year-over-year. Finally, Q2 was another record quarter, representing the highest number of Windows licenses sold in one quarter ever. In fact, Q2 beat the previous record set last quarter by 20%. In summary, it was an exceptional quarter for the Windows Division. With Windows 7, we have terrific consumer momentum and a great product for the business PC market when it recovers. Now let\u2019s move to server and tools. The server hardware market was stronger than expected for the quarter although still down slightly year-over-year. Our OEM and license only revenues continued to outperform underlying X86 server hardware market shipments while annuity revenue grew low single digits. This quarter we released Windows Server 2008 R2. Customer adoptions of this and our virtualization and management offerings continue to build momentum. Revenue from our virtualization offerings such as Premium editions of Windows Server and Systems Center grew double digits. At PDC, we provided an update on Windows Azure, including the anticipated commercial availability next month. In addition, we recently announced a three-year agreement with Hewlett-Packard. This partnership offers customers comprehensive solutions whether for data centers or public clouds. We are also very excited about the upcoming May release of Sequel Server 2008 R2 which will further expand our capabilities in business intelligence and data warehousing. Now for the Online Services Division. While search revenue grew, display revenue was hampered primarily by international rate declines. We continue to be pleased with Bing\u2019s momentum to date including seven consecutive months of share gains in the US. Regarding our Yahoo! Partnership, we are still working through the regulatory review process and continue to be hopeful the deal will be approved early this year. Now onto the Microsoft Business Division. In general, the conditions from last quarter remain unchanged. Revenue was down 3% as enterprise spending remained soft. Business revenue was down 6% due to weak business PC sales. The non-annuity component of business revenue was pressured in advance of the next product cycle. Annuity revenue was roughly flat as expected. Consumer revenue which includes the OEM and retail portion of this business increased 12%. This growth was primarily due to better than expected consumer PC shipments although it still lags the overall PC market. Within MBD, we continue to see double digit growth of our SharePoint, Office Communication Server and Dynamic CRM products. During the quarter we released a beta of Office 2010 which has been downloaded over 2 million times. In the Entertainment and Devices Division revenue was down 11%. During the quarter, we sold 5.2 million consoles, a year-over-year decline of 13%. Due to the favorable mix shift to Elite and Special Edition consoles, console ASPs were down only slightly following the Q1 price cuts. While our software attach rate continued to grow and lead the industry at 8.8, attach revenue declined as we faced difficult comps with the prior year. Xbox Live continued to contribute to the quarter\u2019s performance and now has 23 million members, over 35% growth from a year ago. We also continue to make progress in the mobile space and you will hear more about that at Mobile World Congress in February. Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold decreased 7% to $3.6 billion driven primarily by lower Xbox 360 volume and console costs. These savings were partially offset by increased traffic acquisition and online costs. Operating expenses increased 1% to $6.9 billion and included approximately $290 million of legal expenses. We continue to execute on our resource management plan and during the quarter eliminated an additional 800 positions. Year-over-year headcount declined 8%. This quarter cash flow from operations was $5 billion and we repurchased $3.6 billion of shares and paid $1.2 billion of dividends. So to wrap up, while we have yet to see a return of business spending growth, the consumer segment performed better than expected and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the reception of Windows 7 by our partners, developers and most importantly our customers. We continue to be excited by our momentum and believe we are well positioned for the future. With that I will hand it back to Peter who is going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. Now I will discuss our expectations for calendar 2010. From a macro perspective, IT spending should improve from the recessionary levels of 2009. Taking into account second quarter results, we are incrementally positive towards the PC and server hardware markets. As we have been saying, we expect the business hardware refresh cycle to begin this calendar year occurring gradually over a couple of years. When thinking about the remainder of fiscal 2010, keep in mind that our third quarter tends to be seasonally weaker than our second and fourth quarters. Now addressing each of the divisions individually. In the third quarter, we expect Windows Division revenues to be roughly in line with the overall PC market growth. Attach gains and inventory rebuild relative to the prior year should offset macro trends of consumer PCs growing faster than business PCs and emerging markets growing faster than mature markets. When thinking of sequential trends in the third quarter, keep in mind Q2 included a large retail launch impact. For the full year, we expect Windows Division revenue to grow in line with the overall PC market growth. The Microsoft Business Divisions revenue in the third quarter should largely demonstrate the same dynamics as in the first half. Consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, will face ongoing pressure in advance of the next product cycle, and as such should lag overall PC shipments until Office 2010 becomes generally available in June. We expect annuity revenue, representing 60% of total revenue, to be broadly flat for the full year. The release of the Office 2010 beta this quarter was an important milestone. We have received terrific feedback from early adopters about the flexibility and powerful new ways to stay productive across the PC, browser and phone. As you think of the fourth quarter financial impact of the Office 2010 release, keep in mind the timing of the launch is late in the quarter and the financial impact should be seen starting in FY11. The server and tools business is most closely aligned to server hardware shipments and business IT spending. We expect server shipments to show year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 for the first time in several quarters. We expect non-annuity revenue which is approximately 30% of the total to move generally in line. Annuity revenue should grow mid single digits while services should be roughly flat for the year. For the Online Services Division, the outlook for online advertising appears to be improving. Excluding the impact of our legacy access business, we expect revenue to be roughly in line with the market for the third quarter and full year. In the Entertainment and Devices Division, revenue should directly track with the overall gaming market and we maintain our view that full-year revenue should be roughly flat. The past two quarters, we have made good progress containing our cost of goods sold, despite the upward pressure of increased traffic acquisition costs in our search business and growth of our online services. As a result of our operational initiatives, improved Xbox 360 console costs and an increasingly favorable revenue mix towards Windows, we now expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue to be roughly flat for this fiscal year. With regard to operating expenses, we remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and aligning resources. For the full year, we reconfirm our guidance of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. This takes into account our second quarter performance, the impact of one-time costs, including the Yahoo! partnership integration expenses and higher revenue driven selling expenses. We also reconfirm that our capital spending for the year will be more no than $2 billion and our effective tax rate should be approximately 25%. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and will return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the long run. In summary, we delivered very good financial results and are well positioned for future growth. We have great momentum in the market with Windows 7 and the upcoming launches of Office 2010 and Natal. Heading into 2010, we are encouraged by the possibility of improving market conditions converging with the strongest wave of products in our company\u2019s history. Although the timing is uncertain, we are well positioned to capitalize on the business spending recovery when it occurs. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill and answer some of your questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Barb, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: My question is around average selling prices. If you look at the average selling prices in the quarter, they improved sequentially and obviously you are seeing both mix help that on the consumer side. But as we get a little bit deeper into the corporate upgrade cycle you are going to see a lot higher dollar value. How should we be thinking about average selling prices? Should we see steady sequential improvement there or some of the puts and takes around where you are seeing growth in the PC market going to offset that?\nPeter Klein: Obviously, the biggest driver of the ASPs will be the business PC refresh and the growth in that. The timing of that remains uncertain. We maintain our general view which we have had, that that will start to occur this year and occur gradually over the next couple of years. As that does, that obviously has an impact on our average selling price. What we saw this quarter on the consumer side was the great adoption of Home Premium as well as Windows 7 on netbooks which is driving that up sell that Bill talked about. Those two things combined will be the driver and it really depends on the macro.\nAdam Holt: Do you think you saw a one-time spike there or do you think that premium mix can remain at that high level?\nPeter Klein: We think, as we said in the guidance, revenue is going to be in line with PCs. There are some headwinds from emerging markets and consumers. So we will have to offset that with the ASPs and attach.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sara Friar - Goldman Sachs.\nSara Friar: Can I ask a question on the cost side? There still seems to be some debate on the Street as to how tight a reign you will keep on costs even though you have done a phenomenal job thus far. So I know you aren\u2019t guiding for fiscal 2011 on this call but could you maybe just philosophically talk a little bit about the growth rate? I think you have messaged a low single digit inflation type rate, and then on the COGS side flat for next year is a great outcome. For next year with Azure and so on kicks in I am assuming we should assume the gross margin continues to come down.\nPeter Klein: Obviously, it is too early to talk about FY11. We are working through that planning process right now and as soon as we get through that I will certainly get out and talk to everybody about that. Let me hit the operating costs. We are executing against our plan very effectively. I have been focused on even before taking this role working with Chris and the leadership team on that and feel great that we have a thoughtful plan that we have come up with and we are doing what we said and executing against that. A big part of that is prioritization and making sure the resources are allocated to the higher return areas. That will be the approach we take when we build our FY11 plan absolutely. So that approach stays the same.\nSara Friar: On the COGS side and the assumption that Azure will continue to drive that down?\nPeter Klein: I think there are multiple dynamics on the COGS side. It is too early to get into that for FY11. There are puts and takes in online services, traffic acquisition costs, offset by improvements we make across the board, whether that is Xbox 360 consoles and some of our operations as well. So we have to get through the planning process on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill - UBS.\nBrent Thill: On the enterprise agreements, I think you mentioned the sales cycle has lengthened and you are flat year-over-year. Can you elaborate in terms of what you expect for the second half of the fiscal year on enterprise agreements? I would think considering the robustness of the product cycle that that would start to trend back up.\nPeter Klein: Yes, that is the hope. Certainly on the enterprise agreement renewals, it is starting to take longer. We are getting them done. The sales cycle is elongating. The good news is we are getting them done. Maybe not in the quarter that they expire, but when we get them done we are not dropping products off of them, and in most cases we are actually adding new products onto the EA. So we feel great about the trajectory there. I tend to agree with you as the enterprise spend does pick up given our product pipeline we feel very well positioned from an enterprise agreement perspective.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini - ISI Group.\nHeather Bellini: I was wondering if you could help us think about the trends in deferred revenue? Obviously that is going to be a big driver of your fiscal 2011 growth. In particular, last year was obviously a challenging year for enterprise spending and you are saying that enterprise spending isn\u2019t coming back, so would it be fair for us to think about your sequential deferred trends for the remainder of fiscal 2010 being more in line with what you had in the back half of your fiscal year 2009 just so we can help shape our models for the upcoming season?\nPeter Klein: Well, it is hard to say. A lot of that is going to depend on the shape of enterprise spend and business spend. Obviously, we are\u2026\nHeather Bellini: Based on how you think spend is going to come out, based on your views about enterprise spending not coming back any time soon.\nPeter Klein: The thing I can say is we have a great product pipeline. We don\u2019t have visibility into exactly what business spend is going to be, so we are just going to have to work through that over the next couple of quarters. The only thing we can control as we have been saying is the products. We feel like we are executing against those and we will keep working the enterprise agreements as we can.\nHeather Bellini: So would that mean it would be unreasonable to assume\u2026I mean last year I would imagine was a difficult closing environment as well so is a measure of conservatism with kind of seasonal growth rates like you had last year in deferred be prudent in your view versus expecting an uptick?\nPeter Klein: I would just encourage anybody to think their view, there is different views of what enterprise spending is going to be. You will just have apply your view of that.\nBill Koefoed: I don\u2019t think we are going to give guidance on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Just wondering, there has been a lot written about how you can deploy Windows 7 on the consumer side or the business side with existing hardware without trying to upgrade. I am curious on the consumer side and the business side what are you hearing? Can you give us some anecdotal data on revenue that you are seeing from so called shrink wrap purchases on the consumer side and maybe on the business side as well? At the threshold [ph], you don\u2019t need to buy a brand new PC but I guess you could deploy Windows 7 on the existing hardware. What are you seeing on the business and consumer markets in regard to that?\nPeter Klein: Good question. On the consumer side, we had a very good retail quarter, about $500 million which is a little bit more than we expected. So that dynamic as you highlighted is exactly happening. People are going to retail and buying shrink wrapped Windows to put on their PCs. On the business side, anecdotally a lot of interest. Businesses are incredibly enthusiastic about deploying. So we will hope to see that flow through over the coming year. So in both cases, a lot of positive momentum as you indicated.\nKash Rangan: I guess Steve Ballmer has to take his words back because he said 200 to 300 is the max we should expect, so you are off to a great start on the retail shrink wraps. Congrats.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Following up on the consumer question. A year ago netbooks were a huge concern and year-over-year basis they didn\u2019t really change as a percentage and maybe there were some pricing changes on Windows 7. Has the dilutive impact of netbooks stabilized or started to change in any way?\nPeter Klein: Yes I would definitely say it has stabilized. The mix has stayed stable. Our attach is very high at over 90% and as Bill said over 50% of that is Windows 7. So what we are finding is people want Windows 7 on all devices and all form factors. That is really what has been driving the quarter and the success of Windows 7. We have worked closely with all of our OEM partners to deliver the broadest range of devices, PCs, notebooks, whatever you have, whether it is a netbook or a laptop or a notebook or a desktop, Windows 7 is on them. So that is very positive for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback - Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: A couple of weeks ago you announced a bit of a reorg in the E&D segment. Could you help us understand how some of those moves can help you close the gap in those businesses, especially on the mobile side and some of the devices going forward?\nPeter Klein: They don\u2019t change the strategy that we have in both of those businesses. You do need to separate mobile from the entertainment side or the Xbox side. The Xbox is in a very good position right now. We have a great installed base of engaged users. We have the Xbox Live asset. We have got Natal coming out. We are working through the profitability on the console costs. So a ton of momentum and a really exciting year coming up. On the mobile side our strategy remains the same. As we have been saying from a product perspective, we are working very hard on the next version of Windows Mobile. As Bill indicated, we will be talking more about that in Barcelona in a few weeks. I wouldn\u2019t think of the organization changes as fundamentally changing the strategy. It just puts us in a better position to continue to execute against what we are doing.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: On the operating expense side, if I back into the midpoint of your guidance, it basically implies a year-over-year increase in OpEx in the second half of about 10.9% give or take versus obviously the decline in the first half. Now I understand that we are starting to anniversary some of the headcount reductions but I just want to get a sense for what is driving that increase or what line items or initiatives?\nPeter Klein: So the biggest ones are the ones I talked about. There are the Yahoo! integration expenses, which is a one-time, new expense that we didn\u2019t have last year. And then given the increased revenues we will see over the recessionary levels that we saw last time, there are just some variable sales costs that go along with that. So those drive year-over-year increases and those are the two biggest things. Obviously, we have been aware of those, it has been included in our plan and our guidance that we have had for the last several quarters.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Difucci - J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Difucci: It looks like the OEM unit license growth on the OS is about 5 to 7% greater than the PC unit growth. With the launch of Vista, that delta was like 8 to10%. I am just curious because there were some decent reviews on Vista when it came out but there were some questions at that point and in the end it really looks like Windows 7 is going to be a much greater success for you. I am just curious if you think you can see some more I guess\u2026I know there are a lot of things that affect that but inventory build in the launch of a new OS seems to have a big effect. Where the inventories are today, do you think you can see even more benefit in the following quarter?\nPeter Klein: Inventories are at about normal levels. So we feel pretty good and all the checks we have done on sell through, inventories are at a normal level. In terms of the comparison to Vista, it is a different world now. We have some headwinds that we may not have had then in terms of the segment mix that Bill talked about in terms of consumer and emerging markets, which is really some headwind. So if you break that out granularly and you look at the attach and inventory gains of 10%, half of that being attach, that is a good result. As I mentioned before, for us to continue to grow in line with the PC market, given those headwinds of the segment mix, we are going to have to continue to do better on attach and inventory and some of the XO [ph] as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: By when can we expect market share gain by also translating into revenue growth acceleration and any update on the timing of regulatory approval for the Microsoft-Yahoo! deal?\nPeter Klein: No updates. We are still waiting for regulatory approval and we are still hopeful we will close that deal early this year. It is a long-term process. We are continuing to gain share. What we really need to do is get the Yahoo! deal done, get that integrated and start to get the benefits of scale. So this is something you would expect to see in 2011 and beyond.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nTodd Raker: Turning to the enterprise adoption cycle around Win 7, can you give us any sense in terms of what you are seeing when you are talking to corporate out there? I know you don\u2019t want to pre-announce Service Pack 1 but any kind of visibility in terms of how you think the adoption cycle might play out over the course of this year would be useful.\nPeter Klein: It is hard to say exactly how it will play out. I will tell you the activity and the conversation, there is nothing about waiting for service packs. Everybody is really super excited about Windows 7 right now, and so there is a ton of activity. How that will play out in the deployment cycles remains to be seen and people are working through that. I would say there is way more business activity now than in previous launches.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert - Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: It looked like you bought back almost $4 billion in stock this quarter. Is that right? And then can you just tell us what your philosophy is going forward on repurchases and dividends?\nPeter Klein: It was about 3.6. My philosophy over the long-term is going to be very consistent with what we have been doing. We had a target amount of appropriate cash we think we need to have and then the operating cash flow after capital and acquisitions will be over the long-term distributed back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. So exactly same consistent philosophy we have had over the last several years.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners.\nTim Klasell: The guidance on the entertainment and devices division is roughly flat. Could you walk us through some of the puts and takes particularly as we get into later stages of the product cycle and the macro of them [ph]?\nPeter Klein: The puts and takes are you should think about sort of the whole generation of gaming. We have Natal coming out this year and so you should think of it beyond sort of the rest of this fiscal year. Then how we go up and down depends on the timing of software titles. We have industry leading attach but there is a big difference on timing when we have first party titles versus third party titles. So I would consider what we are doing, excellent growth, and then it sort of gets re-energized with Natal as we head to holiday next year.\nTim Klasell: So maybe roughly flat for the calendar year or roughly flat for the fiscal year?\nPeter Klein: That was the fiscal year. We haven\u2019t talked about FY11 yet.\nBill Koefoed: So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft Investor Relations website at www.microsoft.com/msft. Please keep in mind that we will be at a number of conferences in the next couple of months, including Mobile World Congress in February.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. I want to point out one last thing before I turn the call over to Chris. With the recent move of Windows Live we changed the name of Client Division to the Windows and Windows Live Division. During the call, we will refer to this business as the Windows Division. Okay, Chris, the call is yours.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. The results of the first quarter were strong, particularly on an adjusted earnings per share basis, primarily as a result of two main factors; consumer demand for our Windows and Xbox products combined with excellent cost controls. This result was achieved despite relative weakness in business spending which has yet to see a broad based recovery. Having said that, it is showing signs of stabilization at lower levels and while it is too early to tell, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 may well have been the bottom of the economic reset. Looking at the broader picture, at our Financial Analyst Meeting in July I articulated our approach to what we described as the \u201cnew normal\u201d around five major shareholder value strategies; maximizing cash flow, streamlining our cost structure, driving operational excellence, capturing market share and investing in innovation. I am very happy with our progress in each of those five strategies during the quarter. For example, operating cash flow was $6.1 billion in the quarter which is a terrific result given the economic conditions are still challenging. We resumed our share buyback program with $1.4 billion of shares repurchased in the quarter, retained our $0.13 per share dividend, and built on our net cash and investment balance to over $33 billion. During the quarter, we also continued to focus on our long-term cost structure. We realized a 10% decrease in operating expenses over the prior year due to a lower number of people employed, lower cost per person, lower vendor spend and lower marketing costs. Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 4% lower than the same time last year, the first time a reduction of that significance has been achieved in the company\u2019s history. After the last three months we have continued to show great operational excellence with not only the successful launch of Windows 7 but also the Windows Server 2008 R2 global launch yesterday and the recent release to manufacturing of Exchange 2010. In market share, while it is very early days, we are very happy with the progress of our search engine, Bing, and other notable accomplishments during the quarter include the continued gains in Windows Server, Systems General Management Tools and Xbox Live. Despite the focus on costs, we have continued to invest in innovation and this year to name a few, we will release Windows Azure, SharePoint 2010, Sequel Server 2008 R2, Office 2010 and continue to deliver innovations in Bing. In summary, I am very happy with both the short-term quarterly financial results and our progress on the factors we believe will drive long-term success. With that, I will provide on our outlook after Bill gives you some additional details on the quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Chris. I will start with a company overview and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. All of my comments are adjusted for the $1.5 billion of revenue deferred this quarter from both the Windows 7 upgrade program and Window 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability.  Keep in mind that this is a non-GAAP view and all GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our slide deck.  All gross comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise. Overall, revenue was down 4% because of continued weakness in global demand especially in the business segment.  This was a positive result considering the macroeconomic environment and as Chris noted earlier, we were pleased with the strength of consumer demand, particularly for our Windows and Xbox products.  Foreign exchange headwinds had a $233 million or about a two percentage impact in the first quarter. This quarter, our product billing mix was roughly 35% annuity, 30% OEM and 25% license only, with the balance coming from our other businesses.  Enterprise agreement renewals were in line with our expectations and our multi-year annuity revenue grew low single digits in line with our outlook last quarter.  In terms of geographic mix, revenue in the U.S., driven primarily by consumer demand, was relatively strong compared with other regions.  Unearned revenue again, adjusted for Windows 7, was down $13 billion, down slightly from last year.  Our contracted but not billed balance was over $13 billion in line with last year. Now let\u2019s move on to our thoughts on the PC market.    PC hardware demand improved significantly.  On a sequential basis, we estimate the PC market was up mid-teens.  Year-over-year we estimate the market grew 0% to 2%.  We estimate consumer PCs grew mid single digits from last year primarily due to growth in netbooks.  This quarter, netbooks represented about 12% of the total PC market similar to the mix last quarter and represented significant growth over the prior year.  Business PCs declined high single digits year-over-year but were up sequentially. Now with that back drop, let\u2019s move on to the revenue and business drivers by segment beginning with the Windows division.  Overall, OEM unit sales increased 6% from last year, several points over the PC markets due to higher attach and some inventory build in advance of the Windows 7 launch. At our financial analyst meeting in July, Steve shared with you a slide that bridged the change in the PC market to OEM revenue growth.  We have included the first quarter bridge in our slide deck. To start, OEM revenues decreased 6% from last year. Changes in segment mix represented a 7% decline in OEM revenue from the prior year.  This was due to the PC market dynamics I discussed earlier, including continued growth in netbooks and the overall higher mix of consumer PCs versus business PCs.  Windows attach and inventory represented a 4% increase.  Attach rates increased year-over-year due to strong attach gains on netbooks and a continued shift to multinational OEMs, which reduced piracy. Other items represented a 3% decrease due to the shift towards multinational OEMs and the wind down of the Windows XP revenue deferral.  The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows division was up 2%, primarily driven by presales of Windows 7. Now let me touch on sequential trends.  On a sequential basis, OEM units increased 19% or about three percentage points faster than the overall PC market.  OEM revenue meanwhile increased 20% sequentially, and as you can see exceeded OEM unit growth. To put the quarter results in perspective, Q1 represented the highest number of Windows licenses sold in one quarter ever, and September was the highest single month of Windows unit sales ever.  In summary, it was a very solid quarter for the Windows division and with Windows 7, we have a great product for the recovering PC market. Now let\u2019s move to server and tools.  In general, the conditions from the fourth quarter remain unchanged.  We had a strong attach with Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center.  As a result our license only and OEM business declined less than the 20% drop estimated for the underlying x86 server hardware market.  Annuity revenue was up single digits in line with the outlook we gave last quarter.  FX rate changes were a two percentage headwind to revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we launched Windows Server 2008 R2 to the market yesterday.  We believe the virtualization and management capabilities offered are currently the best value in the market place and we are excited by the enterprise enthusiasm for this product. Moving on to the online services division; online advertising revenue was down 3% but included a three point FX headwind. While we experienced continued growth in page views, display revenue was weighed down by industry-wide year-over-year declines in advertising rates. On a sequential basis, however, rates seemed to be stabilizing. In the U.S., search revenue was up mid-single digits despite industry-wide monetization declines in the quarter. We continued to make search share gains with Bing with share in the U.S. up every month since the June release. In July, we signed a commercial agreement with Yahoo! to further gain scale and momentum in the search business. We are working through the regulatory review process and continue to be hopeful the deal will be approved early in calendar 2010. In addition, earlier this week we announced strategic partnerships with Facebook and Twitter. These partnerships demonstrate our continued search innovation, and specifically with social media and real time content. Moving on, Microsoft business division revenue was down 11% due to declines in both business and consumer spending. FX rate changes were a 2 percentage point headwind to revenue. Business revenue was down 4%, reflecting weak business PC sales. Within that, annuity revenue was up low-single digits, in line with the outlook we provided last quarter, while license-only sales declined over 20%. Consumer revenue, which includes the OEM and retail portions of this business, declined 34%, driven by tough inventory comps over last year due to prior-year pricing promotions and lower attach from the continuing shift to lower-priced PCs I discussed in my Windows Division commentary. Within MVCs, we continued to see double-digit growth in our SharePoint, Office Communication Server, and CRM products. In the Entertainment and Devices division, while console revenue was impacted by price cuts and volume decline, overall gaming revenue was up almost $100.0 million. Halo 3 ODST was the number one selling console title in the U.S. last month, along with five other Xbox 360 games in the top ten. With a worldwide install base of almost 34 million consoles, Xbox 360 continues to lead the industry with an 8.7 software title attach rate. Xbox Live also contributed strongly to the quarter's performance, with revenue growth in excess of 50%. We believe consumers will be excited by the richer multi-media enhancements and integration with social networks that we are delivering this fall. Now for the rest of the income statement -- cost of revenue was flat at $2.8 billion, driven by increased search distribution and online costs, which were offset by lower Xbox 360 console costs and service and support costs. Operating expenses decreased 10% to $5.6 billion, driven by reductions in headcount, headcount-related expenses, and vendor costs. Diluted shares outstanding were about 9.0 billion, down 2% from the prior year. This quarter, we repurchased $1.4 billion worth of shares and paid $1.2 billion of dividends. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.52, an 8% increase from the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $6.1 billion. So to wrap up, while business spending and the macroeconomic environment remain challenging, the consumer segment performed better than expected and Windows 7 is off to a great start and we feel terrific about our execution this quarter. With that, I will hand it back to Chris, who is going to discuss our business outlook.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Thanks, Bill. The remainder of this call, I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2010, starting with our assumptions for the industry. Overall, the corporate IT spending trends we discussed in July remain intact. In our conversations with CIOs, many remain cautious about existing budgets and spending through the end of this calendar year, however, we believe calendar 2010 has the potential for improvement. Given the industry backdrop, we are extremely well positioned due to the strongest product cycle in our company's history and also continue to believe that we will exit the economic reset a much stronger, more focused, and cost efficient company. Turning to segment expectations, in the second quarter we expected the Windows Division revenue, excluding the impact of the Windows 7 upgrade program, to be in line with overall PC market growth. With the launch of Windows 7, we expect inventory to rebuild in the channel and an increase in retail sales. This should offset the three hardware trends we have seen in recent quarter, which are netbooks growing faster than non-netbook PCs, consumer PCs growing faster than business PCs, and emerging markets growing faster than developed markets. In the second quarter, we expect to recognize virtually all of the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 upgrade revenue deferrals from the last two quarters. For the balance of the fiscal year, we expect Windows division revenue to remain in line with or slightly ahead of the overall PC market growth with the main variable being the pace of business PC improvement. We see the potential for a corporate PC refresh cycle beginning in calendar year 2010 although it could be gradual and occur over a couple of years. We also expect the Net Books mix to stabilize over the course of the year. In the second quarter, we expect Microsoft\u2019s business division dynamics and revenue trends to be to be largely the same as they were in the first quarter with growth lagging PC shipments due to the factors Bill mentioned in his commentary. For the full year, the consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should face the same trends as in the second quarter, with increasing pressure in advance of the next product cycle and as such could continue to lag PC shipments. We continue to expect annuity revenue representing 50% of the total to be broadly flat for the full year. Our last quarter NBD results should improve when we start to see business spending recover combined with the impact of Office 2010. The Server and Tool business is most closely aligned to enterprise spend. We expect this server shipment trend to gradually start to improve towards the end of our fiscal year. We expect non annuity revenue, which is approximately 35% of the total, to move generally in line with server shipments for the quarter and the year and annuity revenue will be mid single digits while services should be flat for the year. In the entertainment and devices division, although we realized upside from our first party gains in the first quarter, remember we did release two significant titles in the second quarter last year which should cause difficult year over year comparisons. We therefore expect C&D revenue to decline several points in the second quarter, but we expect the full year revenue to be roughly flat as price cuts taken in August are offset by tax revenue and a larger console install base. Turning to cost of goods sold, driving cost down in our operations plus a more favorable revenue mix resulted in a better performance there and we now expect COGS as a percentage of revenue to increase one point this year compared to the two we discussed at last call. With operating expenses, we also continue to make excellent progress. We\u2019re lowering our guidance for the full year to a range of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion, down from what we said in July. This decrease however also absorbs an additional $100 million to $200 million of Yahoo! integration costs should the deal pass regulatory review. We will continue to look for additional cost saving opportunities based on cost of goods sold and in operating expenses through the rest of the fiscal year. We expect CapEx to be at most $2 billion for the year and the tax rate to be 25%. In summary, I feel great about how we\u2019re executing given the economic reset that we\u2019ve been through. We\u2019re driving excellent cash flow, product innovation, and continued cost discipline. More importantly, our strategies will position us to take advantage of a recovering economy, which we hope to begin in the next calendar year. The ensuing revenue growth, combined with continuing cost discipline, will set us up for long term earnings per share growth and a significant return of shareholder value. With that, let me take your questions and I\u2019ll hand it back to Bill.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Chris. We want to get to as many questions as possible from you, so please stick to one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. My question is about average selling prices for Windows. You actually saw premium mix increase sequentially. I was wondering where do you think premium mix can go as you get deeper into the Win7 cycle and when would you expect the average selling prices to actually be additive to the Windows revenue story?\nChristopher P. Liddell: In terms of the premium mix, clearly that\u2019s going to change with the SKU structure that we have in Windows 7, and I think we\u2019ll start to see a better -- in terms of [inaudible], a better number going forward simply because we won\u2019t have home basic in the developed markets. So we\u2019re going to see a much better home premium mix. In terms of how that feeds through to the financials, which I think is the main point, we will start to see it improve better but in particular we will start to see it better when we get a better business PC mix and to date, we have been clearly seeing a headwind in that and hopefully next year as we start to see a business PC refresh cycle, we will start to see a better mix there. That average selling price, which in the last year has been probably a negative, I would expect it to turn neutral or even slightly positive as we go through the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John DiFuca with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn DiFuca: It looks like you saw some benefit from channel inventory build this quarter, after three quarters of I think it was a net negative contribution in the last three. You mention you expect inventory to build in the channel I think going forward here. I am just curious, how much more is there before we start to get to what you might consider to be I guess \u201cnormal inventory\u201d if there is such a thing? Do we have another quarter or another couple of quarters? Is this something that could be a net positive for the next few quarters?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I think it will be a net positive throughout the year simply because channel inventory build, and even if it just stays at that level it will be positive relative to our low levels throughout last year. So we don\u2019t need to see any additional build from what we saw for it to be a year-over-year net benefit. I think it is going to be a benefit right through the year. Whether it continues to get even better again we will see and that is going to depend clearly on the demand that our OEMs see through the Christmas period. What we saw, and you are certainly right it was last year as the economy contracted people clearly reduced the amount of inventory hedged so we not only had lower demand we had lower inventory holdings. We saw that reverse in the first quarter but we have only got back to what I would describe as \u201cnormal levels.\u201d We haven\u2019t got an excess of inventory in the channel, although clearly dependant on demand so we have gotten back to a normal level. If we stick with that it will be a year-over-year benefit. If we get good sales and good sell through of Windows 7 based PCs, which we are expecting, we could see some additional channel build as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sara Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSara Friar: To switch gears a little over to online services, you talked a little bit about the timing of the Yahoo! transaction and the expectation that the costs in the cost guidance you have given. Can you give us any color on what you are expecting on the top line for Yahoo! and then any other kind of one-off costs? I know that Steve had mentioned a few way back on the Yahoo! call.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure. The $100 million to $200 million I mentioned in my commentary is the cost and that includes all of what I have described as one-off costs; that is setup costs in anticipation of migrating over, so that would be the total and that will clearly depend on when we get regulatory review, assuming that we do and how quickly we can implement. So there is a range there. On the revenue side there will be virtually no revenue contribution this fiscal year so all of those costs will be like one-off, startup costs that we will incur this year in anticipation of revenue contribution in fiscal year 2011.\nSara Friar: Fiscal year 2011, I know you are not guiding for it but just to put some boundaries around it, what sort of size are you thinking about for Yahoo! right now? We see it as about a $360 million type contribution based on what they have been doing.\nChristopher P. Liddell: It will be hundreds of millions but it is not going to be more than that or less than that, but you are in the right order of magnitude. I can\u2019t give you anything more specific than that on this call.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: On the last call on the COGS side of the equation, you talked about undertaking an internal program to focus on driving down costs. Obviously some of that is showing up here in the guidance going forward. Can you give us a sense of how far through you are with that program and if there are meaningful gains to be had from this point forward?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Certainly in the cost of goods sold area I see that really as a journey that never ends. So that is something that we are going to focus on year after year after year now and certainly in good manufacturing discipline, and a lot of it is manufacturing hardware COGS, that is the sort of approach you should take. Certainly we have embarked on a project which has made some significant difference in the short-term and you are right we are starting to see some benefit of that feeding through this fiscal year. I am really happy with the progress we have made but that is not going to be a one-off where we just do it this year and then we stop. That is going to be something that we will look to continue the disciplines that we\u2019ve put in place in the last six to nine months.  So definitely getting some short term benefit, definitely you will get some this year.  I wouldn\u2019t promise a lot more than we\u2019re starting to guide to because I think we\u2019re fairly accurate on what we\u2019re likely to achieve this year but I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s a program that we can perpetuate next year and the year after and really in perpetuity there afterwards.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Just a question on the server and tools division, clearly there\u2019s a tie to server shipments but as you look out over the next couple of quarters and your commentary on general enterprise spending, when do you think we could actually start to see the inflection point in that line item and how should we think about the services component of that division relative to the license as well?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I\u2019ll stick to external forecasts on the underlying server demand and most of the external forecasts are seeing it improve from around now through to next year, so we would expect -- and we subscribe to that -- we would expect it to get less negative as the year goes on and start to improve through next calendar year. The benefit we\u2019re seeing there is mainly like in market share, so we\u2019ve got great attach relative to the server market so as it starts to improve, we\u2019d see the non-annuity component of our revenue start to improve as well, so that should be an evolving trend through the rest of this fiscal year going into the next calendar year. How quickly that will happen, we\u2019ll see.  I think we\u2019re all waiting to see how well the economy rebounds when it does. We\u2019re still, as I was at the July financial analyst meeting, still on the relatively conservative side. We\u2019re not seeing a large rebound but we\u2019d like to think certainly as we go in to next calendar year we\u2019ll start to see businesses spending again and we\u2019ll be raised with that with good attach. On the services side, it\u2019s going to be pretty flat.  I wouldn\u2019t expect that to bounce back quickly so a flattish expectation on the services side certainly through the rest of this fiscal year and going in to the next one would be my starting point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: Chris, with regard to [inaudible], I was just wondering what are you hearing from corporate?  We\u2019ve been spending some time talking to large corporates that are deploying Windows 7.  It looks like the deployment plans are coming in a little bit earlier than expectations, at least from their standpoint, hearing of the business benefits of deploying Windows 7.  I\u2019m just curious, what are you hearing about the upgrade cycle for Windows 7 in the corporate? Because I would imagine that\u2019s got a pretty significant implication for your business premium mix going into next year because of all the lift you\u2019re getting in the near term seems to be from the consumer side. Also, secondarily I was wondering if you could comment on the shrink wrap business pre-orders in consumer channel for Windows 7.\nChristopher P. Liddell: On the business side you\u2019re right, anecdotal feedback is certainly good at this stage from corporate in terms of their reaction to Windows 7 and the benefits it brings.  We\u2019re still staying reasonably cautious about the upgrade cycle.  Certainly we expect it to begin next year but we talk about it spreading over maybe a couple of years, so I would like to think we would start to see much better business PC numbers year-over-year next calendar year and I think we\u2019ve been consistent on that on the last couple of calls and we\u2019re still there. All of the feedback that we get so far is positive and so that supports a view that we\u2019ll start to see that.  How quickly that will happen, we\u2019re not going to speculate quite yet but certainly all the early signs we\u2019ve got at this stage.  On the shrink wrap or [FPP] side, again we only launched yesterday so it\u2019s a little hard to tell because people are buying in anticipation of demand as opposed to actual demand, but again the --\nKash Rangan: You had pre-order, you were taking pre-orders in the consumer side for that, right?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Sure, that\u2019s been very good but that\u2019s small, that\u2019s small.  But that\u2019s been extremely good.  I would say that being right at the top end of our expectations.  Modest financial impact but extremely good sort of reactions so that has been extremely good and the sales in retail we are expecting through the next three months to be very good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with ISI Group.\nHeather Bellini: Chris, you guys have done a phenomenal job on the cost side, surpassing everybody\u2019s expectations.  I was wondering if you could give us your view on whether or not it makes sense to think OpEx in fiscal 2011 might grow at the rate of inflation, just as a general proxy, especially given that the big bear story is that Microsoft will start accelerating its investments and OpEx will start ramping again once top line starts to improve? Thank you.\nChristopher P. Liddell: This is the earliest ever for fiscal year 2011 guidance, I think. Okay, I don't see, I really don't want to give a specific number, but I don't see any internal force that is going to significantly increase OpEx in fiscal year 2011 at this stage. I think the disciplines that we have put in place are going to continue at least for that period of time and whilst we will clearly be looking to fund some projects, I'm not going to say it's flat, I don't see it ramping back to anything like what you might have seen before the economic reset in terms of growth. And that's in particular because at this stage we're still relatively cautious about the economic rebound so I think the fiscal discipline that you have seen will continue certainly for the next, let's say 12 to 18 months. Now, I caution you with the obvious comment, we're just about to go into our strategic planning round, which then goes into our budgeting round, so that's a directional comments, that's not a specific guidance at this stage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank Securities.\nTodd Raker: Could you dig into the ASP impact a little bit more in-depth on the netbook side, as you see the OEMs moving from an XP SKU to a Windows 7 starter edition, what does that do to the economics of the low end of the business and how do you think that trends out over the next 12 to 18 months?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I would start with the consumer reaction because that's the sort of leading indicator, and how do we feel about the consumer reaction to firstly having Windows on a netbook. Obviously that has been phenomenal, going from zero attached to in the mid-90s. So people are clearly willing to pay for having Windows on their netbook. So that's the sort of first and most important fundamental. Then in terms of Windows 7 reactions, clearly yet to see but early indications in terms of the OEM build that we're having in the mix that they're putting in terms of Windows 7, is encouraging. Now, it's very early days but encouraging at this stage in terms of their expectations of the number of people who are going to want to see a Windows 7 on their netbook as opposed to an XP. In terms of the ASP impact, clearly it's almost twice on Windows 7 what it would be on XP, or a significant premium -- awful lot of space, so it's going to be beneficial but I think it's more important symbolically, from our point of view, that people see value in Windows 7 and are willing to pay for it. Netbooks, even though they have grown fast, they're still a relatively small component of the overall demand. So it's not going to have a massive financial impact but it will certainly help in terms of our ASP comparisons year-over-year, if we get the sort of good attach of Windows 7 that we are starting to see early days of.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my question. Chris, the last two or three quarters Microsoft is underperforming in its display advertising business versus the overall industry. Is display advertising getting ignored because of the increasing focus on search? And then how much of online business weakness is coming with you to the Bing cash back and search distribution deals? Thank you.\nChristopher P. Liddell: On the display side, I\u2019d have to say actually we are performing relatively in line, certainly with Yahoo!, when we saw their numbers, so volume and monetization was sort of broadly in line, I would say, with market, so I'm not entirely sure about your underperformance comment, but nevertheless it is difficult and particularly on the monetization side. So we have seen good volume on the display side. We have continued to see that right through the economic reset. That's been growing in double digits on the volume side. Where the difficulty has been has been on monetization, so in terms of volume, I would say there is no lack of focus because we are continuing to see good user engagement and demand. On the monetization side, it's been tough and it's clearly because of what's been happening in the overall economy. And I think people have been fixed in to have budgets they might have pushed more in the search side than the display side. We should start to see that improve going forward as we see the economy recover, so I think you will see display start to get better. The other thing in display which might be hurting our numbers is just FX. We have a reasonably strong international component, so FX was a headwind in the first quarter. But no lack of focus there, certainly a lot of focus on Search, but there\u2019s plenty of people still working on the Display side. What was the second part of your questions?\nSandeep Aggarwal: It was about is the Bing cash back and search distribution deals, are they causing any weakness in your online business?\nChristopher P. Liddell: No, they\u2019re helping a little bit with volume. They\u2019re not helping significantly with the financial side because of the nature of it, but certainly in terms of the market share growth in the quarter, that was negligible from cash back. That was really all the underlying search engine and clearly the marketing and user engagement we got from there, so not much of an impact from that at all in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Just a quick question around PC unit growth -- we\u2019ve seen everything from third party research, everything from 8% to 10% to as high as 12%. Obviously the Windows 7 launch has played a big part in that growth. Any color you can give us about what you think maybe achieved the lower end of that range or maybe the higher end of that range just independent of Microsoft?\nChristopher P. Liddell: It\u2019s rebounding very quickly and I think in the quarter you saw relative to where we were three months ago, PC demand rebounded very quickly relative to everyone\u2019s expectations, so it\u2019s very hard because of all of the underpinnings of what\u2019s going to happen in the overall economy. What I think we\u2019re seeing is the robustness of the concept of the PC -- even through an economic reset, it\u2019s something that people want to spend money on and I think that gives us confidence in the long term trend and the long term ability to have good, potentially double-digit growth in PC demand. And that\u2019s clearly helped by the fact that we\u2019ve got new form factors, Windows 7 helps clearly. You\u2019re just seeing a general positive trend on a long term basis that was a reset. What that\u2019s going to mean for the rest of the fiscal year, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see good consumer demand. Clearly that was helping last quarter. I think that will continue. You\u2019re going to see good emerging market demand. That\u2019s really continued right through the last year. It\u2019s been double digit growth in most of the emerging markets right through the last year. I think the consumer in developed markets will start to gradually continue to improve. The big theory in my mind is the business PC. That\u2019s been a significant negative -- that\u2019s decreased double digits over the most of the last few quarters and it\u2019s dragged down the numbers.  That can\u2019t continue forever. Eventually those PCs wear out and have to be replaced. So the big variable in terms of rebound is going to be the strength and speed of the business PC refresh cycle. We hope and expect that to be next year. As I said in one of the earlier calls, we\u2019re probably still relatively cautious but when you start to see a rebound in that, plus what we\u2019re seeing in the consumer side, we feel pretty good about what PC demand is going to look like the next calendar year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: Chris, in your prepared comments you talked about the U.S. consumer demand being strong, and you just gave some color on the emerging markets demand. Can you talk about Europe, what you\u2019re seeing there, both on the corporate and the consumer side?\nChristopher P. Liddell: Europe is relatively weak. That would probably be the weakest area on a relative basis. So I would start with emerging markets, in particular China and all the major ones. The U.S. recovering a bit, Europe relatively weak so that would be at the low end of all the numbers that I\u2019m seeing.\nKatherine Egbert: When can you expect recovery do you think there?\nChristopher P. Liddell: I guess when you see economic recovery. It depends on how you feel about that. I think what we\u2019ve said, and I\u2019ll stick with this, even though it was perhaps a bit of unexpected quarter this quarter is this calendar year has transitioned to next calendar year. I feel very good about the dynamics or potential dynamics the next calendar year as we start to see economies improve. You\u2019re seeing economic forecasters expecting economic growth next year globally and in Europe. You are starting to see forecasts for business spending turning [inaudible] with people like Gartner, again on a global basis. So that is going to underpin spending overall. The European consumer, when they will start to get more aggressive, I really don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t expect a lot for the rest of this calendar year. I would start to see it improve the next calendar year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Can you remind us again of when you recognize revenue on Windows in the PC cycle and the PC supply chain cycle, and what type of lag there potentially is between the PC build and your revenue recognition?\nChristopher P. Liddell: When we sell it to the OEMs is when we recognize it. Now they buy licenses in anticipation of selling PCs, obviously. That can vary in terms of their supply chain as to how far in advance and when they actually make a sale and they buy the license. It can vary but on average I would say a couple of months, around eight weeks. People last quarter were buying licenses in anticipation of sales that they are making this quarter and they will be buying licenses now in anticipation of Christmas, for example. It varies depending on the supply chain of the entity but on average, around eight weeks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.\nTim Klasell: A follow-up to the prior question, in your OEM revenue bridge you show 4% from Windows attach and inventory. I wonder if you can give us a little color of how much of that 4% is attach, i.e. maybe sort of longer-term sustainable versus inventory which can be pretty volatile?\nChristopher P. Liddell: It is about half and half. It is about half of what we describe as inventory impact and about half attach. On the attach side, there are two impacts there. One is the continuing growth in Netbooks which has a very, very high attach rate. So as they grow slightly faster than non-Netbook PCs, you see attach benefit. And also MNAs, the larger OEMs, we certainly see them gaining market share and they tend to have a higher attach rate than the system builder channel as well. So we are starting to see some attach benefit from that. So those two attach benefits add up to about half of what we show in that line. The other half I would put down to sort of inventory replenishment in the channel.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Greg Moskowitz with Auriga.\nGreg Moskowitz: As you had pointed out earlier, business spending remains subdued but the license only mix was higher than I had expected. I know you had the benefit of a couple of extra field days relative to the June quarter, but even adjusted for that it showed pretty healthy sequential growth. I was wondering if there was anything you would point to on the business side that perhaps helped transactional billings in the quarter?\nChristopher P. Liddell: No, nothing specific I would point to there. There were a couple of, as you said, there were a couple of days of billing that we had out of the June quarter but then also we lost a day into the next quarter so there wasn\u2019t a significant impact from that. I would just say generally speaking we are seeing good adoption of our products. We have a good product suite out there so I would point to that but there are no underlying trends that I would say were particularly positive. As I pointed out in my commentary, really the business cycle was very much as we expected in the quarter and you have to remember what we are seeing now is just people playing out their budgets on the corporate side that were set let\u2019s say in December last year when most people were expecting the world to be very difficult through this year. People are just simply spending their budgets that are set to a large extent. It is unlikely that we are going to see a rebound even in this quarter coming up. It is only going to be next year when people reset their budgets for next year in the next few months and perhaps start to take a slightly more optimistic view that we will start to see business spending start to pick up. No particularly positive trends that I would point to other than overall reaction to our product suite. It was fairly much as we anticipated, which was subdued during the quarter.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Richard Williams from Cross Research.\nRichard Williams: I wonder if you could give us some sense of the Windows Live growth rates that you expect over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.\nChristopher P. Liddell: Windows Live is really going to be driven by in particular how we see that monetization come through and that comes back to -- on the strength of the overall economic recovery. I would like to think we are going to see display rates go up as we start to see the economy recover and I think you are starting to see that from us and other people. Or certainly it stopped getting worse and [seems to be stable], I think. I again would probably stick with the same basic line we\u2019ve had on most things, that we\u2019ll start to see some economic improvement on that side as the economy starts to improve but that\u2019s going to be next calendar year more than this calendar year, and it\u2019s probably going to be gradual. That continues to be our base case pretty much across the board for all the things that sort of drive in particular the business side.\nBill Koefoed: Okay, everybody so that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Remember that you can access this call on the Microsoft investor relations website at Microsoft.com/msft.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the fourth quarter, which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution, as enterprises furthered their commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. Customers continued to invest in our Business Desktop offerings, including Windows 7, where enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our overall multiyear licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products. As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%. As I look back on fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products while making strategic investments and alliances that will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenues double digits and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than 20% for the second year in a row. Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains 5x faster than the previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics to their multiyear agreements. These 4 products collectively drove approximately 30% of the business division's growth this year. We made great progress on our cloud initiative this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way. Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past. In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat while strengthening customer commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-sized businesses, we now offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low upfront cost. And with 80% of small businesses having never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is significant. During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. At the same time, building private cloud infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers, and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers. In search, Bing continues to gain market share. In this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our relationship with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!. We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined search marketplace. During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live, which now has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and operating income in the Entertainment and Devices division. In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype, which will extend Skype's world-class brand and global reach of its networked platform, while at the same time enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With Skype, we will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications to both consumers and enterprises, thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft. In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our strategic investments and alliances which will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year, while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue was $69.9 billion, growth of 12%. Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter, and for the year, a record $27.2 billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year. For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and multiyear commitments drove our unearned revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not-billed balance is now over $18.5 billion. The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter, over 40 million PCs, representing half of all global PC shipments, were shipped to emerging markets. We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In total, we estimate the PC market increased 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter. Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division, where revenue was down 1%, reflecting the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge at our earnings slide deck. Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced that we had sold over 400 million units of Windows 7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7, and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan. During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have reimagined Windows for a new generation of touch-centric hardware. You'll hear more at our BUILD developer conference this September. Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued launch cycle momentum. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 6%. We launched Office 2010 one year ago, and for the year, the business division's revenue increased to over $22 billion, an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow double digits this quarter. Within our Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new seats on Dynamics CRM, and now, 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM every day. Now let's move on to the Server & Tools business, which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 12%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double digits 10 consecutive quarters. We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server Premium revenue grew almost 20%. Last week, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further enhance customer's private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share more details on these at BUILD in September. Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth accelerates. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform. Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social graph to help people make better, smarter decisions. As Peter mentioned, we continue to experience challenges with RPS, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible. Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter, we sold over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the #1 selling console in the U.S. for the year. At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forza 4 [sic] [Forza Motorsport 4], Kinect Star Wars, Kinect Disney Land Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games. Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly, and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB. And this fall, we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem. In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone. Mango will deliver deeper social experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing experience. During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on Verizon and Sprint and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially. Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Enterprise Services and our Server & Tools business continues to grow rapidly, and Online Services costs are also up, reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in selling-related costs. During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate, which impacted our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the year; and second, we completed our tax filings, which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the onetime benefit in the third quarter related to the IRS settlement. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year, continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. In the past 5 years, we have returned over $90 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%. In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year, both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year. As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to continue their transition to the cloud, given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current portfolio and investments, we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. Now turning to our outlook by business. For the Windows and Windows Live division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with emerging market growth significantly outpacing developed market growth. While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to increase Windows penetration, they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and have higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, with the business PC refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year. Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high single digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year. Turning to the Online Services division. We expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. Within the Entertainment and Devices division, we expect revenue to grow high single digits for the first quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware, reflecting last September's Halo Reach launch, and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin. Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. The biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. In fiscal year '12, we will continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Moving to unearned revenue. Given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double-digits over this fiscal year. In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal year '12, we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Carol, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be from Walter Pritchard, Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: You mentioned in the slide deck there that 20% of the FORTUNE 500 has started to adopt the Office 365 Online Services. And I'm assuming it's pretty early there, but I'm wondering if you could help us understand how quickly you expect that to progress throughout fiscal '12, and sort of what impact we should see on the financial statements as that starts to happen in fiscal '12 or maybe beyond.\nPeter Klein: Yes. You see it hit the financial statements in 2 ways actually, Walter. One is will be in the actual Office 365 revenue, but also as we continue to have the conversations about the migration to the cloud, you see that show up in our multiyear licensing revenue, and you saw some of that this quarter with our really strong multiyear licensing revenue across the board. The market response so far has been great. We're really excited about it. We expect that to accelerate over time. But again, I think you'll see it in both ways. You'll see it in our multiyear licensing revenue and in our Office 365 revenue.\nOperator: The next question will be from Adam Holt, Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: My question's about the E&D commentary for next year, which was, I think, a surprise, relative to, certainly, the consensus expectations in that it's a lot higher than where consensus was for next year. Can you talk a little bit about some of the detail behind the assumptions there? Specifically, what are you expecting or what is embedded around the Nokia relationship, and what are you expecting and what's in the numbers around any kind of share gains following Mango?\nPeter Klein: Well, the single biggest driver in the E&D division is going to be Xbox, right? And so we've got great momentum in the marketplace with the console, which we've refreshed a year ago, with Kinect which just came to market last holiday, with a bunch of new content and titles that Bill talked about in terms of games as well as broader entertainment content. So as we look to continue the momentum that we have with our share position in the marketplace, you see the strategy really coming together in that business, selling the installed base of the consoles and then having the social connectivity with Xbox Live and the broader entertainment portfolio. And so a lot of that strength relates to the Xbox business. Additionally -- I mean, I think it's fair to say that our division thinks that we've just scratched the surface of the possibilities with both the Xbox console and Kinect. And obviously, as I talked about with the games that we had coming out at Christmas, people are super excited about the possibilities there.\nOperator: The next question is from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I just had a quick question. There's been a lot of talk about patents and money that you guys could be receiving for patent violations. How do we think about modeling those, if there's any tips you could give us? And how do we think about those -- where they would show up and kind of what segment they get embedded in?\nPeter Klein: I think the most important thing to think about, stepping back, is of our overall approach, right? We have a firm culture and belief in innovation, intellectual property and protecting our right to intellectual property. And we've done that consistently with the industry-wide licensing program related to Android. Specifically, broadly too, but Android, which infringes on some of our patents. I think we haven't talked a lot about what to expect from a modeling perspective on there, so you should just look to what we do on our licensing program going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Just going back to deferred revenue. Obviously, that was well ahead of consensus, and I think it's the strongest year-over-year growth you've had in MBD since '06 and Server & Tools since '08. What really changed this quarter, the second half of the fiscal year that drove that up so much from what we've been seeing over the past couple of years? And just anything specific to those 2 divisions as well.\nPeter Klein: Yes. No, there are several things. One, the business refresh has continued as companies have come out of the economic downturn of a few years ago. They really are investing in technology. They're seeing the opportunities for technology to really enhance their value proposition. And they are seeing the benefit of our technology. They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set. In MBD, it's really about intentional strategy we've had really over the last 3 to 5 years to sort of broaden the view of what productivity means and how we integrate, not only the great new Office applications, but also with e-mail, with Exchange, collaboration with SharePoint and more recently, communications with Lync. And customers are really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our revenue was driven by growth in those businesses. And if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics, in taking share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth, and that really is sustainable. At the same time, in Server & Tools, we've really scaled our products across the board, whether that's with the premium versions of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and customers are investing in their data centers, in their private cloud implementations on the way to the public cloud, we're really taking advantage of that and getting good double-digit growth there. So the combination of a really strong environment for businesses investing in the value of IT and our product set sort of across the board, from infrastructure to applications, has been great.\nOperator: The next question is from Brent Thill, UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter, just on enterprise demand. Is there any change in terms of what you're seeing in the U.S. versus European demand profile?\nPeter Klein: No. This quarter, we actually saw broad-based demand across all the geographies. Obviously, emerging markets remain very strong. But this quarter, we saw demand and great sales execution really across Europe and the U.S.\nOperator: The next question will be from John DiFucci, JPMC.\nJohn DiFucci: Bill, when you said that 25% of enterprise desktops are already deployed with Windows 7 and 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan, I was just curious. Is it fair to say that about -- that 25%, should we be thinking of those as largely on the lower end, in the SMB that sort of act more like consumers? And does the committed, your word there, \"committed\", does that mean that they're already contracted for, or they've started to contract at the lower level and you expect that to continue going forward?\nPeter Klein: Yes, that's a great question. On the enterprise side, clearly, companies like JPMorgan have started looking at Windows 7 and working on the deployment plan. When we think about the term \"committed\", it means that either a Microsoft sales rep or a partner actually have plans in place where they're looking at a rollout schedule. So it's a very deliberate plan. They're engaged in testing. In many cases, I think we talked about that last quarter, but not so much this quarter, they're also rolling out Office 2010 at the same time that they're rolling out the Windows 7 Desktop. So we're excited obviously about the speed of the deployment process that's been underway, but we also think there's a lot of opportunity for the future. And I think to your point probably, enterprises are a little bit further along just due to the -- probably the macroeconomic environment. And we've seen more deliberate execution there than maybe in some of the other areas. That's a great question.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Breza, RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Peter, I was wondering if you could talk to, I think, your comment, you said that you believed unearned revenue could grow low double digits. I'm assuming most of that's going to be coming on the enterprise side. And you specifically called out in your commentary some of the drivers to that growth. Could you maybe just help us clarify that in terms of the unearned revenue?\nPeter Klein: Yes, you're correct. Most of that growth will come from the enterprise, and it goes back to that strength we're seeing in selling multiyear licensing agreements and the demand we're seeing for the product set across the portfolio of the Business Division and the Server & Tools business. So the dynamics that we saw this past quarter, we see playing out again next year, and that will drive the unearned growth for the full year. I would add, and I talked about this a little earlier but I'll go back to it again, the conversations increasingly that we're having with the cloud, whether that's Office 365 or Windows Azure or Windows Intune or Dynamics CRM Online, really play into that as well because we find increasingly, customers wanting to make long-term commitments when they see that migration path to the cloud as well. And that, you'll see coming to, I think, even more play this year.\nBill Koefoed: Yes. I think communicating our roadmap to our customers has been a big advantage. And they like our roadmap, they're committed to our roadmap, and that's been a really good thing.\nOperator: Brad Reback, Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Peter, on the revenue per search aspect towards Yahoo!, can you give us any sense how far along the road you are there? Do you think you're 30% of the way to getting the problem solved?\nPeter Klein: That's a good question. What we think and what we say and what we believe is we're on a path and we're totally aligned with Yahoo! on this, and the collaboration has been fantastic and the right people are focused on it, is we'll have this turned around by the end of this calendar year and move forward from there. And we're still on a path to do that, and I think both sides are signed up for that plan.\nOperator: The next question is from Colin Gillis from BGC.\nColin Gillis: Peter, just on that same theme in Online Services, can you give us a sense what percent of the expense is ongoing costs and then what percent might be transition costs that could possibly roll off?\nPeter Klein: The bulk of it's ongoing cost. There's a little bit of transition cost, but you should think of the bulk of it is ongoing cost. And really, the dynamics of that business, as you know, are -- it's a high fixed-cost business, it's a scaled business, and as we grow our revenue per search, that's a highly leveraged revenue dollar that we get. It goes against that fixed cost base.\nBill Koefoed: So clearly, improving our RPS is our goal that we're laser-focused on as we've talked about.\nPeter Klein: Completely.\nOperator: Brendan Barnicle, Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Peter, how should we think about repatriation of cash as you guys generate so much in some of these foreign jurisdictions?\nPeter Klein: Well, the broader issue of just income tax policy, we'll leave to the experts. Obviously, we're supportive of long-term enhancements to our income tax policy. In terms of repatriation specifically, I don't think it's a big issue one way or the other for either our operations or our strategies or what we're able to do. We've obviously had a very good year both in terms of our financial results and our ability to deliver cash back to shareholders.\nOperator: Ed Maguire, CLSA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. Could you discuss the monetization trends you may be seeing from Xbox Live? Seems like you've got some decent subscriber growth.\nPeter Klein: Yes. No, it's really been fantastic. As we've grown the subscriber base, there's actually a couple of revenue streams. There's the subscription revenue stream and then there's the transactional revenue stream for people who actively engage with the service that they can buy purchases while they're engaged in that. And that really helps to accelerate the monetization of that business. And that's a really, really amazing long-term opportunity for us, particularly as we continue to take share of just the whole console platform.\nOperator: The next question will be from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.\nGregg Moskowitz: Peter, I just had a question on guidance. In the past, you've talked about Windows revenue growth roughly tracking PC unit growth. We all know about the mix shift to emerging markets, but is there anything you can say to help frame how we should think about the gap between Windows revenue growth and overall PC growth in fiscal '12?\nPeter Klein: Yes. I think I would stick with the framework that we gave, and it's -- there's hopefully a lot of texture to that. And depending on one -- what assumption one makes about the growth in emerging markets versus developed markets and businesses versus consumers really impacts what that growth will be. Obviously, the more faster growth there is in emerging markets relative to developed, is more headwind for the Windows growth relative to the overall PC market. But I think understanding what your belief is about those dynamics should help a lot with that.\nOperator: The final question will be from Tim Klasell, Stifel, Nicolaus.\nTim Klasell: Office 365 has now been out in the market for a little while. Can you -- but you have multiple bundles at very wide price points. Can you sort of point to a bundle or the bundles that appear to be the most popular right now?\nPeter Klein: Well, it's been out for about a month, so it's really too early to tell. But I would say that the philosophy behind that pricing is to provide the right set of choices for every customer in every segment, depending on what their needs are. And so ultimately, I think we'll see a broad cross-section of customers choosing different pricing plans, whether you're a small and medium business who's never had Exchange or SharePoint or Lync before, there's a really affordable option for you to jump in. For enterprises who need much more scalability, who need premium versions, they can pay a little bit more. And so as always, we really believe in understanding what the different needs are, different customer segments, in structuring our SKUs and our pricing to reflect the best options for every customer segment depending on their need.\nBill Koefoed: So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we again delivered solid financial results, reflecting strong business and consumer demand for our products and services. Despite a mixed PC environment, the breadth and depth of our portfolio drove another quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. On the commercial side, we saw strong multiyear licensing commitments by enterprises and robust transactional sales, particularly to small and medium businesses. Let me give more color on these. On the business desktop, customers continued to embrace our offering. Not only is Office 2010 the fastest-selling version of Office in our company's history, but businesses are purchasing our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And with the recently released public beta of Office 365, the next generation of our cloud productivity service, we are enabling new scenarios that weren't viable in the past, especially for small and mid-sized businesses. Office 365 eases deployment for our customers while lowering their upfront costs and provides significantly better returns on investment. Enterprises are investing in our business infrastructure offerings, with a growing preference for our premium products. Windows Server, SQL Server and our management tools are enabling our customers to transform their data centers to be more efficient. Companies are reaping the benefits that Windows 7 brings, including enhanced productivity, efficiency, security and manageability. Enterprise deployments of Windows 7 have more than doubled over the past 6 months. While business PC shipments showed strength this quarter, consumer PCs declined. Within both segments, emerging markets continued to be an area of strong growth. As demonstrated by Bing's continued market share gains since its launch, we have made great strides in relevancy and design and continue to transform search beyond just queries to task completion and decision making. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with Bing, there is significant work ahead to improve the monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing marketplace. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but revenue per search is below our expectations. We have our best search technical leadership on this issue, and we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to improve monetization as quickly and efficiently as possible. Turning to our Entertainment and Devices division, in November, we took the first step in creating a new mobile ecosystem by launching Windows Phone 7. In this quarter, we took the next step by entering into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. Together, Nokia and Microsoft will innovate with greater speed and provide enhanced opportunities for users and partners to share in the success of the new ecosystem. Consumers are delighted with Kinect, as well as our entire Xbox 360 platform for the revolutionary experience it brings to their living room. Kinect continues to lead the way forward in gaming and is opening the door for new scenarios to take advantage of natural user interface. So in summary, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with prioritization of investments and our continued focus on operating expense management, allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong financial results. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results. And then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, 13% growth year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.61, up 36%. Adjusting for Tech Guaranteed programs, this was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a record $8.7 billion or growth of 17%. Operating cash flow year-to-date has surpassed $21 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion. Many of the demand trends in the third quarter were similar to the first half of the year. Specifically, Office 2010, Xbox and Xbox Live and Kinect continue to enjoy exceptional consumer momentum. On the commercial side, enterprise demand for our products remains strong. Businesses are deploying Microsoft platforms and applications, including Windows, Windows Server, Office, Dynamics and Management Tools. The business demand is translating into healthy increases in transactional licensing and strong enterprise agreement renewals. Our unearned revenue balance grew 6% to $13 billion, reflecting continued strength in our customers' multiyear commitment. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $17 billion, growing approximately 20%. Bookings for the company were up 8%. Now let me turn to the PC market. There are 3 trends we are observing. First, business PC growth was 9% this quarter. The business PC refresh cycle continues and is still in the early stages. Second, emerging markets continues to play a larger role in total PC shipment volume and now represent nearly half of all worldwide PC shipments. Finally, the consumer PC market declined 8% as there are several dynamics at work, including a 40% decline in netbooks, broader consumer macroeconomics, increased competition for consumer spending and the strength of Windows 7 consumer PCs in the prior year. In total, we estimate the PC market declined 1% to 3% in the third quarter. With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted there would be a $100 million headwind to Windows comparables for the third quarter due to the prior year Windows 7 launch. Adjusting for this dynamic, Windows revenue was in line with the PC market as we guided. As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. To summarize, the PC industry dynamics of continuing strength from emerging markets offset the benefits of a higher business mix and improved attach. Since the launch of Windows 7, customer satisfaction and market reception have been terrific, and we have more opportunities ahead. While Windows 7 has now sold over 350 million units since launch, an estimated 75% of the PC installed base is still running older operating systems. The number of PCs running Windows 7 in the enterprise has more than doubled over the past 6 months, and volume licensing has strengthened. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC market with Windows 7. There is innovation occurring in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including slates and convertibles, which are starting to hit the market now. This quarter, we also released Windows Intune, a cloud-based subscription service that will help businesses manage and secure Windows PCs. Windows Intune provides significant new opportunities for Microsoft and our partners to further expand our reach, grow our revenue and delight customers. With Windows Intune, we have an opportunity to bring even more customers to the cloud. During the quarter, we launched the latest version of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 9 utilizes the power and performance of the whole PC to provide users with a faster, more immersive web experience. With new features, such as hardware-accelerated graphics, support for HTML 5 and integrated Windows 7 navigation, websites act more like applications on IE9. And just a few weeks after releasing IE9, we released the platform preview of IE 10, which will deliver innovation for the next generation of web experiences powered by Windows. Now I'll move to the Microsoft Business division, which excluding the prior year Office Tech Guarantee deferral, grew 13%. We continue to see terrific response to the release from both consumers and businesses. Adjusted for the prior year deferral, consumer revenue grew 26%, with increased Office attach to PCs. The business transactional portion grew 28%, also driven by improved attach rates, postlaunch and higher business PC shipments. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 5%. Businesses are deploying Office 2010, along with Windows 7 on the corporate desktop. Office 2010 deployment rate is 5x faster than the deployment of Office 2007. Importantly, businesses are also attaching the Office Server applications: SharePoint, Exchange and Lync, which all grew double digits this quarter. Lync grew 30%, and we are seeing tremendous reception to the product. As we have discussed previously, Unified Communications is a huge growth opportunity, and Lync offers an immediate return on investment to CIOs. Last Monday, we released the public beta of Office 365, and we continue to see momentum in business Online Services. The number of customers using our services has quadrupled since last year. Over 50% of our customers are small businesses, but we're also seeing large enterprises, governmental and educational institutions moving to the cloud. This quarter, we announced large customer wins, including Shell Oil, Tampa General Hospital, Advocate Healthcare and Manpower, among others. Our Dynamics business grew 10%, with both Dynamics ERP and Dynamics CRM increasing account penetration. In the third quarter, we launched Dynamics CRM 2011, and we are seeing great traction with 40,000 businesses already in product trial, a significant pipeline to our current 27,000 customer base. We also recently announced that the next release of Dynamics ERP will be cloud enabled. We are delivering world-class business applications on premise and in the cloud that are simple, agile and deliver more values than competitive offering. Now let's turn to Server and Tools, which posted 11% revenue growth. Server and Tools had strong performance across the entire product portfolio. Transactional revenue grew faster than the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multiyear license revenue grew 11%, and Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%. In the data center, we continue to increase the penetration and monetization of Windows Server and System Center. We saw strong Enterprise Agreement renewals of Windows Server this quarter and premium revenue was up double digits. System Center, our management offering, grew double digits for the 10th consecutive quarter. Hyper-V continues to win new business and establish new performance benchmarks on key workloads. This quarter, we showcased a large customer win, with Target Corporation. Target is running business-critical workloads for all 1,700 retail stores using Microsoft virtualization and management technologies. In the database, SQL Server unit volumes and ASPs were up, with a shift toward our premium editions. SQL's premium revenue has now grown double digits for 4 consecutive quarters as customers adopt higher level capabilities, such as business intelligence. Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong momentum and developer interest. This quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Toyota, who will be using Windows Azure for its enterprise-grade, scalable platform to provide advanced telematics services. Next, I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 14%. Online advertising revenue, including both search and display, grew 17%. Bing's U.S. market share continue to grow, ending the quarter at 13.9%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter and almost 600 basis points since launch. We feel great about the pace of our innovation and customer satisfaction with our differentiated approach to search. However, the expected monetization of the combined Yahoo! and Bing search marketplace in the U.S. and Canada is taking longer than planned, and revenue per share remains below our expectations. We have delayed our international integration efforts to focus on improvements in the U.S. and Canada. Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew an impressive 60%. Xbox has been setting the pace in the gaming industry this fiscal year. With Kinect recognized as the fastest selling consumer electronics product ever, we sold an additional 2.4 million sensors this postholiday quarter. We also shipped 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles, a new third quarter record that surpasses the previous high by 1 million units. Xbox Live also continues to increase its contribution to our customer experience and E&D's financial performance. We again saw healthy increases in transactional revenue, which continues to exceed subscription revenue. Turning to Windows Phone. Product reviews are good. Customer satisfaction is high, well above 90%. And we have shown a clear strategy for enabling a vibrant ecosystem around Windows Phone. This quarter, we took the next step and entered into a broad strategic alliance with Nokia. While we have enjoyed strong developer support to date with more than 13,000 applications, we've noted even greater developer interest subsequent to the Nokia alliance announcement. Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 41% this quarter due to 3 primary factors: one, volume driven costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors. Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live. Two, as I mentioned in the Server and Tools performance, our Enterprise Services business is growing rapidly. Costs in this business are largely volume driven. And three, Online Services costs are up from increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were $6.8 billion, an increase of 4%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was below our guidance, due primarily to the $461 million onetime benefit related to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle a portion of their audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. In the third quarter, we repurchased $827 million of stock and declared $1.3 billion of dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned $13.9 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, 33% more than the previous year. In summary, it was a very solid quarter with strong financial results.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2012. From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter will be similar to the third quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets and growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs. As a result, we expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with the PC market for the fourth quarter. Turning to the Microsoft Business division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rate, but at a moderating rate as we approach the Office 2010 launch anniversary. Revenue associated with multiyear licensing agreements, representing approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid to high-single digits. Turning to Server and Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. Within this division, we expect transactional revenue to generally track at the hardware market, and multiyear licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low double digits. Within OSD, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the overall online advertising market. Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 25% for the fourth quarter. Switching to cost of goods sold, as was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of Entertainment and Devices, Enterprise Services and integration and traffic acquisition costs associated with our search business. Turning to operating expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for fiscal year 2011. We expect our effective tax rate to be 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will follow historical sequential growth pattern. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to our next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal 2012. The PC market dynamics I discussed for Q4, emerging markets outpacing developed markets and business outpacing consumer should also continue through the next fiscal year. While we expect ongoing healthy demand for Office 2010, we expect more difficult year-over-year comparables for the Microsoft Business division. For Server and Tools, we expect to continue to outpace the server market due to our premium offerings and product portfolio. Within our search business, we expect to see revenue per search improvements over the course of the calendar year. Lastly, we expect momentum within our Entertainment and Devices division to continue. Moving on to Cost of Goods Sold, as was the case in fiscal 2011, the most important factor to consider will be the shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, Enterprise Services and Online Services. We expect fiscal year 2012 operating expenses to grow 3% to 5% from the midpoint of our fiscal 2011 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses. Based on this growth rate, we expect fiscal 2012 operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. In summary, I'm pleased with our healthy financial results for the quarter. As we look forward into the next fiscal year, our robust product portfolio and ongoing focus on cost management will enable us to continue to deliver shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Bobbi, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: My question is on expenses. In the quarter, the gross margin was a little bit lower than I had modeled. I was wondering if you could go through the puts and takes of what hit gross margin this quarter? And then looking into fiscal '12 in general, would you expect revenue to outpace your operating expense growth?\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Adam. On gross margin, it was really the 3 things that Bill described. Sort of the biggest thing is fantastic growth in the Xbox business, and that was the single biggest driver of COGS growth in the quarter. Secondly, Enterprise Services, which is volume-driven, and they are having nice growth, so that shows up in COGS. And then finally in Online Services, some costs associated with the Yahoo! alliance. As you know, some of that revenue that we get from that alliance from the Yahoo! property gets tacked out in COGS and some other traffic acquisition costs. Those were the 3 big drivers of the COGS growth, all volume driven.\nBill Koefoed: With respect to the second part of your question, Adam, as you know, we don't give revenue -- specific revenue guidance. And we give you operating expense guidance and you can model it from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.\nWalter Pritchard: Could you help us understand just on the COGS, I guess, following on to Adam's question here? As we look into next year with some of the integration costs around Yahoo!, and I guess I'm also wondering around kind of mix within EDD, how much we should expect, sort of what we've seen over the course of this year be indicative of where gross margins are in the future? Do we think we're on sort of a new kind of trajectory in those individual businesses?\nPeter Klein: Well it depends what you model in for the volume, right? So these COGS are volume driven, so depending on how you think about each of those individual businesses, really is the driver of COGS. We try to give that framework, so it's easier to understand that. And certainly on the Online Services business, our key focus is that COGS are volume driven. Most important thing there is to get that revenue per search up because that really has the biggest impact on the gross margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from the ISI Group.\nHeather Bellini: Peter, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about buybacks. I know that Bill said the return of capital to shareholders was up 1/3 versus last year. But I'm just wondering if you could talk about the level of buybacks and kind of, how we should think about your appetite for buybacks going forward?\nPeter Klein: Yes -- no, I think we have a pretty consistent track record over the last several years in terms of distributing cash back to shareholders, in terms of dividend and buyback. And so those numbers that Bill cited were sort of indicative of that. We've had a pretty consistent track record on that, and that's been our philosophy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter, can you just reconcile, on the PC market, Intel and AMD are saying one thing, you're saying it's worse. And just trying to understand, is this because of piracy or lower ASPs? What's accounting for that? And what's your view in terms of the snapback for the PC market in the second half of the year?\nPeter Klein: There are some unique things going on with Intel's results that you can sort of reconcile back to what we're saying that make a lot of sense. First, if you try to reconcile their revenue growth, certainly, they have an ASP uplift, which is actually the single biggest part of driving the growth. There's a few other things in terms of an extra week in the quarter. They've also excluded netbooks from the PC MPU numbers.  And I think there was some appropriate inventory buildup so if you look at our numbers, it ties pretty closely from a unit perspective to what they're seeing. And obviously, we're in line with the big third party analysts as well.\nOperator: Mr. Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse, your line is open.\nPhilip Winslow: Just looking for a little bit more color on the Microsoft Business Division side. Obviously, we're coming on the sort of the tail end directly of uplift of Office 2010. Obviously, you're talking about tougher comps, but what is sort of the right long-term growth rate for that business over the next couple of years? And then also, just in terms of G&A, we saw a big step up quarter-to-quarter this quarter. Was there anything onetime in there like you guys had in the December and March quarters of fiscal '10?\nPeter Klein: So obviously, we're not guiding to specific growth rates for MBD, but I would highlight a few things. Obviously, we're incredibly excited about the customer reaction to Office 2010. But even beyond that, you heard us talk about how customers are adopting the whole sort of suite of products, not just the Office application, but SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics and Lync. And that really provides long-term sustainable growth for the MBD business all up, even in a year that's sort of not a launch year. So that's, I think, a way to think about what's going on in MBD. In addition to that, we've got Office 365, so -- over the course of the next coming years. We've had great growth. As we talked about, quadrupled the number of sort of Business Online Services customers we have. With the introduction of Office 365, we sort of take that to the next level. So as you think about the next year or 2 for the MBD business, those are some of the factors that I think really drive their growth.\nOperator: Colin Gillis from BGC Financial, your line is open.\nColin Gillis: Can you just talk to the new leadership in Servers, like what Satya brings to the group?\nPeter Klein: Yes, Satya is just a wonderful business leader. He comes from a background of both business applications and cloud services, so he's really the ideal guy to take that business to the next level. I personally had the -- an opportunity to work with Satya closely in the past. [Technical Difficulty] He's a great leader.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: So Peter, there's been a lot of confusion or a lot of talk around the Nokia partnership, what the economics are. Could you maybe help straighten out the record on that? And probably more importantly, give us any sense that there's going to be an impact to 2012 COGS as it relates to this deal?\nPeter Klein: Well I will talk about the Nokia. The great thing about the Nokia deal is this in an incredibly perfect opportunity for both of us to build a really compelling, vibrant third ecosystem, if you think about the complementary set of assets that we all bring to it. And in terms of the hardware design, the hardware manufacturing, the global relationships with operators, certainly with our platform that has great developer momentum and the kinds of services of Xbox Live and Office. Clearly, this is a broad strategic alliance, it's a long-term strategic alliance, and we're going to be working closely together. And we are each making investments together along those lines. And I think the important thing to think about is, as we sort of build that out in its success, it's going to be a great thing for both companies and for customers and for other partners in the ecosystem.\nOperator: Robert Breza from RBC Capital Market.\nRobert Breza: Just quickly, can you talk about the delay that you're doing internationally? And how long do you think that'll take before you can get it up and running?\nPeter Klein: Yes, we're going to work on North America, the U.S. and Canada. And when we feel like we've got that straightened out, we'll move on to the other international markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.\nGregg Moskowitz: Peter, you're tracking to lose a few more cents in the online division in fiscal '11 versus fiscal '10. Obviously, RPS improvements going forward would help, but you'll also be rolling out the integrated platform to additional markets. So wondering if you could perhaps offer anything else about the EPS prospects for OSD next year relative to fiscal '11?\nPeter Klein: Yes, well certainly, we're not going to give specific outlook more than what we've given, but you've hit on the key issue, which is the revenue per search. That's -- we've been clear on the opportunity. And the strategy there is to continue to grow share and to increase our revenue per search. And so obviously, we're laser focused right now on getting that revenue per search up, and that has high leverage into certain margins for the company going forward.\nOperator: Sandeep Aggarwal from Caris & Company.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Peter, can you provide us any color in terms of the -- how's the, your new architecture effort for -- on tablet size progressing in terms of system-on-a-chip?\nPeter Klein: No, I've got nothing else to talk about that other than what we've already said.\nOperator: Ed Maguire from CLSA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. You discussed healthy activity in multiyear commitments. Could you address how you and your customers are mixing Business Online Services? And looking at Office 365, how ultimately that may affect your model in terms of COGS?\nPeter Klein: Yes -- no, it's a great question. Actually, one of the interesting things about Business Online Services and the coming -- the pending Office 365 is, it's enabling really great conversations. And actually, it's been a driver of the increase in multiyear licensing commitments because people have a lot of questions about the cloud and the transition to the cloud, having a clear story, having a partner that can help them transition in the pace that they want to. It's actually been the driver of the conversations we're having with enterprises. And going forward, the economics of that are it's an increased revenue and total profit opportunity for us. The subscription services do have a higher COGS and so a lower gross margin in terms of percentage, but over time, that's a growth in absolute margin dollars for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: When I look at this quarter, we've already gotten past the 4 quarters, how product cycle helped revenue growth. It looks like this quarter, if I make adjustments for Office, you're still looking at high-single digit 8%, 10% type growth rate against normal comparisons. Any reasons to think that if IT spending and economy continue to stay the way they are, to think that this growth rate should, in fact, decelerate as you go into fiscal '12? Or if you can argue the other side that it should stay, that this growth rate is sustainable? Both sides of the argument, appreciate it, thanks.\nPeter Klein: Yes, without giving specific guidance on growth rates, I will say we feel great about how enterprises are investing in IT, and in particular, how they are very interested in our product suite. I think we've got a very broad compelling set of products for the enterprise. And if you look at any number of CIO surveys, most of them say, a high priority focus area for CIOs is our suite of products. And so directionally, I would say we feel great about sort of the IT market and certainly, our position in that and our product set.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Tim Klasell from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nTim Klasell: Maybe you can just give us your thoughts about the timing of a launch of the next-generation Xbox console? And if a decision hasn't been made, do you guys internally have a time point of when you think you have to make that decision?\nPeter Klein: No, we're really not talking about that. Right now, we're incredibly excited to about what's going on with the Xbox 360 console and certainly Kinect, which is relatively new in the market, so we're very focused on that. Okay, so that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A few weeks ago, we announced our plans for Microsoft's 2011 Financial Analyst Meeting, which will be on the afternoon of September 14, 2011, in Anaheim, California. FAM will be held in conjunction with our Developer Conference, which will kick off on September 13 at the Anaheim Convention Center. This year's FAM will feature presentations by key executives about the company's strategic direction and will supplement the Developer Conference Presentations, which offer people the opportunity to learn directly about our product strategies and roadmap. In the meantime, we look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we are participating in this quarter. For those of you unable to attend any of our events in person, you will always be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need any additional details. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for everyone's participation.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered excellent top line and bottom line results. Business and consumer response to our latest wave of innovation, including Office 2010 and Kinect, helped drive yet another quarter of healthy revenue growth, resulting in revenue of nearly $20 billion. Our solid revenue performance, combined with cost controls and continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities, enabled us to deliver record earnings per share and our sixth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion. On our last earnings call, I commented that we were looking forward to an exciting holiday quarter, especially from consumers. Kinect, in particular, exceeded our expectation. The controller-free entertainment experience is revolutionizing the living room. Kinect is the fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history. We couldn't be more proud of what the team has accomplished. But importantly, it's just our first step in delivering on the opportunity to fundamentally change the way people interact with technology. The Microsoft Business Division also had a terrific quarter. Office 2010 is the most successful consumer version we have ever shipped, and the product is also performing extremely well in the Business segment. Companies are purchasing Office 2010 as well as our entire productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange and Lync. Businesses are also deploying Windows 7. According to IDC, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have already started their formal migrations to Windows 7. In addition to healthy enterprise deployment of our Business Desktop, we saw a strong momentum for our business infrastructure offerings. Windows Server and SQL Server premium revenues grew double digits, and this quarter marks the one year anniversary of Windows Server 2008 R2. Since its launch, we have grown our share of the overall server market every quarter. During the quarter, we continued our product launch momentum. In November, we delivered Microsoft Lync 2010, a next-generation communications platform that incorporates instant messaging, presence, audio, video, Web conferencing and voice into one interface that integrates with the applications businesses are already using today, including Microsoft Office, SharePoint and Exchange. For the consumer, I already mentioned Kinect. Also during the quarter, we launched Windows Phone 7, which is now on nine devices with 60 operators in 30 markets. We said all along that our first priority was to make a phone people love, and to that end, we're pleased with the initial response. Customer satisfaction data indicates 93% of customers worldwide are happy with the product, and we're also seeing strong developer engagement. While we're encouraged by the early progress, we realize we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and we remain focused and committed to the long-term success of Windows Phone 7. We continue to deliver sustained innovation and releases for Bing. In addition to transitioning Yahoo!'s paid search in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Facebook. Bing now provides much more personalized experiences by allowing users to bring their Facebook friends into their Search experiences. So in summary, our record performance for this quarter rounded out a very successful calendar year for Microsoft. We delivered strong financial results and invigorated the market with our product innovation. With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.7 billion of deferred revenue, which was recognized in the second quarter of last year. The deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability. We've reconciled the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless I specify otherwise. Okay, now to our results. This quarter's performance continued the momentum we've seen over the past year. Total revenue for the company was up 15% to nearly $20 billion. Operating income grew 20% and earnings per share grew 28%. Bookings grew 21%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit bookings growth. We continue to see strong momentum with Windows 7. As Peter mentioned, nearly 90% of enterprise companies worldwide have started their formal migrations to Windows 7 and many have already recognized material savings as a result. Office 2010 is the fastest-selling consumer version of Office in history, with license sales over 50% ahead of Office 2007 for the equivalent period following launch. Office clearly remains the world's most popular productivity platform for both home and work. We've experienced an incredible consumer response to our latest products. Kinect, in particular, was the hottest gift this holiday season and has been mentioned by a number of publications as the most innovative product of 2010. Businesses of all sizes continued to commit to Microsoft's platforms. This quarter, we saw a better-than-expected increase in transactional licensing and Enterprise Agreements renewed in the historical range. Our unearned revenue balance grew 7% year-over-year to $13.4 billion. On a sequential basis, after adjusting for the $224 million of Office Tech Guarantee recognition, our unearned revenue balance declined $278 million. Our contracted-not-billed balance grew to over $16.5 billion, a $700 million increase from the prior quarter. This growth in our customer's multiyear commitment, combined with our strong transactional sales, resulted in a solid 21% growth in year-over-year bookings. Geographically, emerging markets continued to outperform mature markets. Now turning to the PC market, we estimate close to 90 million PCs were sold globally, the biggest quarter ever, representing growth of 2% to 4%. Business PCs grew faster than consumer PCs as companies continued to refresh hardware and has opt to Windows 7. Within consumer PCs, netbooks declined from their peak last year while notebook growth remained healthy. With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division. Last quarter, we noted that there would be a $600 million headwind to Windows comparables for the second quarter due to the Windows 7 launch spike last year. Adjusting for this dynamic and the prior-year Tech Guarantee recognition, Windows and Windows Live revenue growth was in line with the PC market. As usual, you'll find an OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The revenue per license benefit from a higher business mix was offset by emerging markets growing faster than developed market. This quarter marks the one-year anniversary of Windows 7. Today, we are announcing that we have sold over 300 million Windows 7 licenses to date, continuing its momentum as the fastest-selling operating system in history. Looking ahead, we are excited about the partner innovation underway in the PC and Windows 7 ecosystem as seen at CES. The PC hardware dynamics are incredibly strong, with innovation in new ultra-portables, all-in-ones and other form factors, including tablets, plates and convertibles. The new Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Fusion chip architectures substantially improved performance, graphics and battery life. In addition, we announced at CES that the next version of Windows will support System on a Chip architectures, including ARM-based systems form partners NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments and x86-based systems from partners Intel and AMD. Windows on System on a Chip architectures will fuel significant innovation across a spectrum of devices. We are enthusiastic about the future of device innovation and the role Windows is playing. Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth. Non-annuity revenue grew roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market, which we estimate grew high-single-digits. Multi-year license revenue growth was roughly 11% and Enterprise Services revenue grew 9%. In the data center, we continue to be pleased with our progress in virtualization and systems management. The virtualization trend is driving double-digit System Center and Windows Server premium revenue growth while significantly lowering our customers' costs. In the database, premium offerings are also a core focus of our strategy, and this quarter, we saw a double-digit growth in SQL Server premium revenue. Among other customer wins this quarter, Dollar Thrifty Auto Group migrated their mission-critical pricing system from Oracle to a Microsoft data management solution, a strategic move that supports the company's goal to standardize on high-value cost-effective technologies. We are excited about SQL Server and our opportunity to drive Tier 1 customer wins. In the cloud, we continued to see developer interest and application development on the Windows Azure platform. Earlier in the quarter at PDC, we unveiled a number of additional platform enhancement and showed how leading companies like Pixar Animation Studios and ADP with NVoicePay were able to develop innovative solutions with Azure. Next, I'll move to the Online Services division which grew 19%. Online advertising revenue, including both Search and Display, grew 23% and now includes revenue-driven by our Search partnership with Yahoo!, which is implemented in the U.S. and Canada during the quarter. We continue to make progress on the partnership, and earlier this month, we transitioned to algorithmic search traffic in Mexico, Brazil and Australia. Bing's U.S. market share continued to grow, ending the quarter at 12% and our Search revenue growth rate again outperformed the market leader. During the quarter, we announced the significant expansion of our partnership with Facebook, where Bing will provide more personalized experiences by allowing users to Search Facebook profiles and incorporate their friend's like into search results. We believe the addition of these new social features is another way to deliver innovation and valuable enhancements to the Bing experience. Next, I'll move to the Microsoft Business Division, which continues to show solid launch momentum with revenue growing 24%. This includes $224 million of recognized revenue pertaining to the Office Tech Guarantee. We've seen enthusiastic consumer response to Office 2010 and business demand has also been strong with the transactional components of MBD sales up over 40%. The multi-year licensing portion of the business grew 9%. CIOs are investing in the new productivity scenarios enabled by SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM, which are enhanced when deployed with Office 2010. Lync grew over 20% this quarter while SharePoint 2010 and Dynamics CRM both continue to grow double digits. This quarter, we reported a number of cloud productivity wins, including the State University of New York, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, DuPont and the state of California among others. We have seen an immediate customer and partner response to the Office 365 announcement, with the beta oversubscribed within its first day. Just two weeks ago, we launched Dynamics CRM online in 40 markets. We're already seeing customers switching from Salesforce.com to Dynamics CRM online. It saves money, it's more flexible and it's easy to use with the familiar Microsoft Office experience for increased productivity. Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, where revenue grew 55% and operating income has now surpassed $1 billion year-to-date, which is a major milestone for this division. Kinect exceeded all expectations with 8 million stand-alone and bundled sensors sold in just 60 days. And since we updated the consoles last June, Xbox 360 has had tremendous momentum. We sold a record 6.3 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 21%. This helped drive Xbox Live membership up 30% to 30 million active members. In addition, at CES, we announced a number of upcoming feature enhancements, including Kinect support for Netflix, Hulu Plus and Avatar Kinect, which will advance how people communicate and enjoy their television experiences. Windows Phone 7 is off to a solid start as handset manufacturers purchased over 2 million licenses in the quarter. Windows Phone 7 is making progress in its early days as user satisfaction is extremely high, and developer momentum has continued to build to now over 24,000 registered developers. As we announced at CES, we are looking forward to adding more features including support for CDMA. Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 33% to $4.8 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, below our guidance of 23% to 24%, due primarily to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5 billion of shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends, continuing to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In summary, it was a strong quarter both for our product momentum, as well as for our financial results. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to various surveys, enterprise IT spend is forecast to grow in 2011, and Windows 7 and Office 2010 remained among the highest priorities for CIOs. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our share of the IT spending market. We expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue. In terms of PC growth, we expect business to outpace consumer and emerging markets to outpace developed markets. With that backdrop, let me turn to segment expectations. Windows division revenue should grow roughly in line with the PC market for the third quarter and the full year when excluding the revenue attributable to the prior-year launch spike and Tech Guarantee. As we said previously, when looking at year-over-year growth, you should exclude $100 million from Q3 of fiscal 2010 for the launch spike. And for full fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $700 million of revenue for the launch and $300 million for the Tech Guarantee. Moving on to Server & Tools. From Q3 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue, approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multi-year licensing revenue, which is about 50% of the total and enterprise services the remaining 20%, should grow high-single-digits for the third quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year. Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, will continue to exceed PC shipment growth rates for the third quarter and the fiscal year due to the Office 2010 launch. We expect revenue associated with multi-year agreements representing approximately 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single-digits for the third quarter and the fiscal year. When updating your models, remember that in Q3 of fiscal 2010, we deferred approximately $300 million related to the Office Tech Guarantee. Moving on to our Online Services division. While we feel great about the progress we have made with the partnership, we recognize that there has been some market place disruption. We are working diligently to address any issues, and we expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually over the next several quarters. We expect online advertising revenue, including organic revenue and new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership, to outperform the overall online advertising market in Q3 and for the full fiscal year. When updating your models, keep in mind that roughly 75% of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net of traffic acquisition costs. Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices division. Considering the enthusiastic response to the Xbox 360 platform, including the Kinect Sensor, we now expect this division's revenue to grow roughly 50% for the third quarter and roughly 40% for the full fiscal year. Switching to cost of goods sold. As was the case this quarter, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the growth of the Entertainment and Devices division. Xbox consoles and Kinect Sensors have higher COGS than the rest of our products, and due to our growth expectations for these products, we remind you to consider this impact in your models. Turning to operating expenses. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion and our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns. In summary, we're extremely pleased with the strong financial performance and continued product innovation we delivered this quarter. Heading into calendar year 2011, our product portfolio has never been stronger, and this combined with our continued prioritization of investments into the highest growth opportunities,  will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and we'll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Great. We want to get the questions from as many of you as possible so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Holly, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: My question is about the corporate upgrade cycle and the impacts on where you are on Windows 7. Would you expect to see the business premium mix increase from the 30% level as you get a little bit deeper into the cycle? And can you update us on where you think you are in terms of any improvements around software insurance attach?\nPeter Klein: Yes. In general, as we talked about the seeing the business refresh and the sort of intent to deploy the enterprises, obviously to the extent their strength in the business PC market, that will be helpful for the mix that you indicated. So given our outlook that, that will continue to outpace consumer markets, that's a good thing. To your point on SA, you think about the commercial side of the business and the volume licensing part the business, that has been strong, reflecting all those numbers that we talked about. So that has sort of -- as we've talked about that a relatively smaller portion of the OEM portion but it's having a favorable impact on the overall growth of the division.\nOperator: Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Bill and Peter, I'm wondering if you can talk about, in MBD we saw really strong transactional business that make up 40% or so, and I think you sort of pulled it to expect that to grow more in line with PCs. And I'm just wondering if you saw any of the business that maybe would have been annuity in nature that showed up in the quarter and transactional, explain part of that strength?\nPeter Klein: No, not really. We're seeing strength both in the annuity side and in transactional side, so it's really incremental which led to their high growth. It's probably helpful to frame that so you can understand the complete picture. We talked a little bit about the strong growth in contracted not billed, because really the funnel where that multi-year licensing revenue really comes into Microsoft. And ultimately, that will flow through to the balance sheet and the income statement so we saw a strong contracted not billed, a lot of that was Office, and obviously, Server & Tools. And so what we're seeing is strong contracted not billed, strong transactional reflected the bookings growth that Bill talked about. So really what we're seeing is better-than-expected uptake, particularly in small and mid-sized companies, who typically buy transactional licenses, not enterprises who typically buy the multi-year agreements. So it really is increased strength in the Office business.\nOperator: Heather Bellini with ISI Group.\nHeather Bellini: I just have a follow-up to Walter's question about the strength in MBD. I mean, you made the comment that non-annuity revenue will exceed PC growth, and obviously, you did a phenomenal job at that this quarter. But this is a much wider gap than what we've seen in the past. So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, do you expect the gap that you've normally been outpacing PC shipments to kind of the gap to widen similar to what we saw this quarter versus what historicals might tell us?\nPeter Klein: Well, the only thing I could say, Heather, as the outlook that we gave is the outlook that we gave. We continue to be certainly very pleased with the customer response to Office 2010. We thought we had a great product coming into the cycle, and that has proven to be true from the customer response. Not only to the suite of applications themselves but how they integrate with SharePoint and Exchange and Lync. So I would just lead you to the outlook that we gave, and we remain incredibly pleased with the customer reaction to the product.\nOperator: Brent Thill with UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter, just on the multi-year licensing pick-up that you're seeing, can you just give us a typical term length in terms of what those contracts are renewing at? And the contracts that are coming back, are they now renewing above the original contract values? Is that a trend that you're seeing as things are improving?\nPeter Klein: They are typically three-year contracts. They sort of vary in length but that's the most common length of our multi-year agreements. In many cases, we are adding new products and services to our multi-year agreements. We talked about some of the products that are showing growth that are some of the newer enterprise products like Lync, like SQL Server Premium Editions. We're starting to get those migrations from Oracle, Tier 1 applications over to SQL. And so as we continue to do those things and people invest in our platform, I think you'll see some opportunity there.\nOperator: Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Just a question on the Windows division. Obviously, PC shipments globally solid, pretty significantly this quarter. Just looking at your KPIs, Windows license shipments were actually down 5% year-over-year. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much you think since obviously, the PC data is in selling as this relates to sort of launch of Oak Trail, Sandy Bridge and so forth in Q1 affecting, you call it, inventory levels but in sort of the channel but also Windows license inventories inside OEMs and how that should maybe change when you think about the calendar Q1?\nBill Koefoed: Yes. In looking at the OEM license growth, keep in mind that there was a spike from the launch last year in Q2, which makes that, exacerbates that issue as people booked up some inventory there. But in general, I wouldn't characterize what we saw in this fiscal quarter as sort of having anything to do with Q1 and some of the new chipsets. I think we saw some macro things on the consumer side but business remains very strong, and I don't think that played a big part in it.\nPeter Klein: I would say we just see the opportunity for Sandy Bridge and Fusion as an opportunity for businesses to improve their refresh outlook as you start to get into 2011. They were super bullish on the chipsets from both of those manufacturers.\nOperator: Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: You always say that emerging PC market is going faster than the mature market. Can you give us some color on that? And then also talk about PC pricing, especially in consumer. And then finally, any comment on tablets and cannibalization?\nPeter Klein: Sure. Emerging markets are growing faster than developed markets. Probably 2x is not a bad sort of ballpark for how to speak through that. Obviously, China played a big part in that and that's the important issue to think through and certainly an opportunity for us going forward.\nKatherine Egbert: Pricing?\nPeter Klein: Pricing on?\nBill Koefoed: Emerging markets versus developed markets.\nPeter Klein: Yes, we've always said that there's about half of what you'd see in developed markets.\nKatherine Egbert: But there seems to be reports that pricing has bottomed. Have you seen that?\nBill Koefoed: We really haven't changed our prices much at all.\nKatherine Egbert: And then finally, just tablets and cannibalization.\nPeter Klein: I think that as Bill talked a little bit in his comments about netbooks and how netbooks were, they hit their peak last year in Q2, and I think what we've seen is over the course of this year in the consumer space, some of that volume being replaced with newer devices like ultra-portables and tablets. And largely, these are second devices, not primary devices. And that's caused a little bit of a drag on the consumer side.\nOperator: Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Just a quick question, Peter. You had talked about the SQL Server Premium business being up double digits in the quarter. I know earlier this week, I think as you announced some appliances with HP. Do you think that type of relationship could further accelerate that growth?\nPeter Klein: Yes. I mean, I think partnerships with some of our key partners are very important for helping us to continue to grow in that part of the market, and HP is a perfect example of somebody who's a very important part -- a partner when it comes to some of this infrastructure and database platforms, and even more broadly, in the cloud pertaining to the market. So yes, I think that can be a real benefit.\nOperator: Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: It looks like you're talking of the business PC versus consumer PC and also, implicitly, the premium mix should also go up yet you're talking about client revenues more or less in line with the PC unit growth rate for fiscal year. I'm trying to reconcile the contradiction there because it would seem like your client revenue should grow faster than PC units, given what we're talking about, especially coupled with Windows 7 enterprise upgrade cycle. Any comments?\nPeter Klein: It's the emerging markets growing faster than developed markets. So we have offsetting dynamics going on. Business PC is growing faster than consumer. It's good for attach and good for pricing and emerging markets growing faster than developed markets has the opposite effect. And so what you're seeing is largely those two things offsetting each other.\nOperator: Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.\nColin Gillis: Just real briefly, Search is now basically a duopoly and a lot of the Search marketers are looking pretty favorably, if anything. Is now the time to increase the outreach marketing efforts?\nPeter Klein: Well, we're extremely focused on doing what we need to do to be successful in that business. And we've been laser beam focused on what that is. One is growing our Search share and the other is growing our revenue per search. And we continue to grow our share every quarter. We're going to continue to focus on that.  We're going to do a lot of things, a lot of the same things that we're doing to that. Bill talked about some of the product enhancements. I think that's probably the most important thing we can do to really differentiate the product experience because I think that's really what drives usage and share in Search. And then of course, on the revenue per search side, the Yahoo! integration is the key component of that, and we're excited to move forward in that. But really on the share side, I mean, we'll do interesting marketing things like we have been doing. But I think what I'm really get excited about is product enhancement with some of the partnerships we've got there.\nOperator: Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.\nGregg Moskowitz: I wonder if you could update us on where the thing stands with regards to Kinect supply and how should we be thinking about units in the Q3. And relatedly, the E&D operating margin of 18% was up three points year-over-year and a little bit of then would have expect to give the marketing launch around Kinect. If you could talk about the prospects for margin expansion over the next couple of years?\nPeter Klein: Well, to your first question on supply, I think you should just go to the outlook framework that we gave you to have a good sense of what we expect for the Xbox business in E&D sort of over the next coming quarters. And in terms of margin, the long-term story is a good one, right? As we build our installed base -- the business model for that is build an install base that really engage users and then you'd attach lots of software and services to has been part of the strength of the Xbox Live service. And of course, as we build the installed base of Kinect, we have a whole new generation and evolution of games that we can sell into our installed base. So all of those things are very positive long term for that business. In the short term for this quarter, we obviously prioritize and allocate our resources very carefully against the launch of that, and so we're able to have a successful launch and still improve the profitability profile of the business.\nOperator: John DiFucci with JPMorgan.\nJohn DiFucci: Peter, I think you said that IDC said that 90% of enterprise companies had started to form a migration to Windows 7. Can you tell us how penetrated you think even roughly corporations are at this point? And when I say corporations, exclude small business. Really talking mid-market to enterprise.\nPeter Klein: I don't know exactly. It's very early. I could give you some of anecdotal feedback in certain conversations that we have with our sales folks and directly with customers. The majority of the people I talk to are either in the middle of doing it or at the last stages of evaluating and have a specific plan to do it. And in fact, most of them have said, we want to go faster because once they get started, they realize the productivity benefits and the cost savings are really compelling. But it is early in terms of getting those migrations done.\nOperator: Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert Breza: Peter, I was wondering if you could talk to us about really the cloud momentum I saw in the slide in the slide deck. But really as you look at Office 365 launching from a beta perspective and to oversubscribed, can you maybe just walk us through how you see cloud revenue 12, 24 months out?\nPeter Klein: Yes, I'm really excited about roadmap and the opportunity. We obviously haven't given any guidance on the revenue of that and how fast it's going to ramp up. Certainly, excited both about the customer wins that we talked about for our existing product and then the conversations we're having about the roadmap off of Office 365 are really exciting. So in addition to just the beta being oversubscribed, it's not part of the conversations we're having with all of our customers. And it's one of those things where it's going to happen and the exact sort of speed of the ramp is uncertain. I do believe that once it starts to accelerate, it's going to accelerate pretty fast.\nOperator: Ed Maguire with CSLA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. I just wanted to follow up on Rob's question around the Online Services and Azure. Could you talk about some of the conversations that you're having and the criteria? As customers are deciding whether to stay on premise or adopt the Software-as-a-Service solution, what that means in terms of their economics and ultimately, what it may mean for you and the business model as it becomes a bigger part of the business?\nPeter Klein: Yes. There's really two dimensions to the conversation. One is about economics and one is about capabilities. The talk about sort of the applications, the Office 365 types of services. People are very interested in that for two reasons. One, ultimately, if the economics are very good for them once they migrate over. But probably even the stronger driver, especially now in the conversations, is the ability to more quickly take advantage of the latest capabilities that we have. So it's a very easy way to deploy the latest versions of our software and increasingly, that's really the biggest piece of the dialogue. And for that, on the Office 365 side, on the Azure side, the conversation's really about moving up from thinking about infrastructure-as-a-service to platform-as-a-service and what they get with Azure in terms of management and security and sort of the developer ecosystem. So that's really what excites them in talking about the platform of the service of Azure, if you will.\nBill Koefoed: Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we'll be participating in this quarter. For those of you who are unable to attend in person,  you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need additional details.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to share with you our excellent results for the first quarter, which reflect the ongoing strength and breadth of our product portfolio. Demand from both businesses and consumers drove healthy revenue growth. We delivered record first quarter revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We continue to control costs while prioritizing our investments into the highest growth opportunities, resulting in another quarter of margin expansion. As we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in July, we have eight core focus areas that we feel have the greatest opportunity to drive shareholder value. This quarter, we had exceptional momentum across these focus areas and I want to start today's call by giving you some important highlights. First, Microsoft Business Desktop is thriving with Enterprises and small- and medium-size businesses investing in our products and services. Not only are companies adopting Windows 7 and Office 2010 at historically high rates, they are also investing in our Office productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics CRM and Lync, the newly rebranded Office Communication server, all of which grew double digits this quarter. Server and Database businesses had strong momentum as our data center and cloud offerings remain a top priority for our customers as they continue to adopt the Microsoft platform. In addition, Windows Azure had strong subscription growth and we announced a number of platform enhancement this morning at our Professional Developers Conference. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, consumer demand for our products continue to drive terrific results this quarter. In terms of our core focus areas, Xbox momentum continued with our console outselling every competing console in the U.S. for the fourth consecutive month, being used at an all-time high with almost double the number of queries since its launch last year. And consumers continue to show their strong preference for Windows 7 and Office 2010. Customer satisfaction across our products remains at record-high levels. We also made exciting progress in the mobile space with the recent launch of Windows Phone 7 in Europe and Asia and the upcoming November 8 launch in the U.S.. So in summary, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter. We executed well in all of our core focus areas, and are off to a good start for the year. With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.5 billion of revenue, which was deferred in the first quarter of last year. As you probably recall, this deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability in the first quarter of last year. We've reconciled this non-GAAP view to GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise. Okay, now to our results. We started this fiscal year with great financial performance. Total revenue for the company was up 13% to $16.2 billion. Operating income and EPS grew 20% and 19%, respectively, again, outpacing revenue growth. Bookings for the company were up an outstanding 24% this quarter. Bookings growth over the last three quarters was the highest in the last three years. Operating cash flow passed $8 billion for the first time ever, and was up 34%. A number of the demand patterns and trends we saw in the second half of our fiscal year 2010 were sustained through the first quarter of 2011. In the first quarter, consumer demand for Office 2010 and Xbox were outstanding. And we're pleased with the continued adoption and growth of Windows 7 and Bing. Sales to small and medium businesses were exceptionally strong with revenue up over 30%. This growth was partially due to a greater level of partner engagement as we had an increase of over 15% in the number of partners selling Microsoft products around the world. We also saw strengthening trends in the Enterprise segment despite what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Our compelling product portfolio across Windows, Server & Tools in the Microsoft Business  is driving increased Enterprise Agreement renewals. Unearned revenue at the end of the quarter was $13.9 billion due to the strength in Enterprise Agreements. The contracted net build balance ended the quarter over $16 billion, significantly above prerecession levels. Geographically, emerging markets continue to significantly outperform the rest of the world. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains stable and healthy. We see customers of all sizes embracing cloud services from Microsoft. Organizations are leveraging our Commercial and Educational Online Services to run their businesses and institutions, while consumers are increasingly using services like Xbox Live, Windows Live and Office Web App. Microsoft has significant cloud momentum and we are leading the industry through this transformation. Turning to the PC market. We estimate PCs grew between 9% and 11% in the first quarter. Consumer PCs grew single digits, while the business PCs grew mid-teens as the business hardware refresh remain strong. From a geographic perspective, we estimate emerging market PCs grew over 3x the rate of mature markets. Regarding netbook trends, we have seen consumer shift from buying netbooks to low-end notebook, and we have not seen a material shift away from low-end PCs due to tablets in the market. Instead, we've predominantly seen consumers increase their number of devices and their usage scenarios. Going forward, we see a strong pipeline of innovation from our partners for new Windows form factors. With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, which grew 10%. Windows 7 drove the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for the division. In the first quarter, Windows OEM revenue, which represents approximately 75% of the Windows and Windows Live division, was up 11%. In our earnings slide deck, we provide the usual bridge, from revenue usual revenue bridge to market, but in summary, the overall dynamics to the market were as expected with strength in business PCs and emerging markets. Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted a great quarter with 12% revenue growth. We estimate the underlying server hardware market grew mid-teens. Non-annuity revenue grew approximately 15% with Windows Server growing in line with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue growth was roughly 10% and Enterprise Services grew 9%. At the Financial Analysts Meeting in July, we discussed the assets and momentum of our Server & Tools portfolio. Let me provide some additional context to the underlying momentum and adoption this quarter. As Peter mentioned, our data center and cloud offerings are top priority for businesses. We estimate Windows Server usage share grew 1.5 points, while at the same time Windows Server Premium mix grew four points. System center revenue growth grew over 20%. And within that, revenue from server virtualization suites grew over 50%. Our virtualization share continues to grow as ID reports Hyper V share of newly virtualized hosts double over the past year to 16.5%. Windows Azure is gaining traction and has grown subscriptions 40% sequentially. This morning at PDC, we announced a number of platform enhancements, as Peter mentioned. These enhancements will help customers build new application and migrate existing applications to the cloud and allow developers and ISPs to build unique applications with the richest data set possible. Next. I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 8%. The online advertising component of this division grew 13%, primarily driven by our Search business, which again outperformed the market leader. Yesterday, Bing reached a significant milestone with the Yahoo! partnership. Through diligent efforts on behalf of both companies, Bing is now powering Yahoo!'s algorithmic and case search results in the U.S. and Canada. Turning to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 14%. In the fourth quarter, I comment is that the markets' reception to Office 2010 has been phenomenal and the first quarter was no different. Consumer revenue grew 26% from continued launch momentum. Office 2010's unit sales are 20% ahead of Office 2007 over the same time period. In addition, our three Office Web App now has more than 20 million users since our June launch. This business portion of MBD [ Microsoft Business Division] grew 11% with the non-annuity sales of Office 2010 up almost 50%. We've seen strong demand from small and medium customers and PCs has rebounded from the year-ago levels. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew about 5%. We've spoken with you about the Office productivity platform strategy, which includes Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics CRM and Lync, and we've seen strong momentum and renewal rate with our 2010 offering. Let me give you some of the underlying product momentum in MBD. Lync grew 25% and the new version is expected to be available in our second fiscal quarter. Dynamic CRM, which just released a new beta this quarter, grew healthy double digits. Sales of Exchange and SharePoint, which are each $1 billion-plus businesses, also grew healthy double digits. Enterprises are adopting the entire business productivity infrastructure. They now have unparalleled choice when deploying their applications in their own data center or in the cloud. During the quarter, we announced a number of significant cloud wins, including the city of New York last week. The number of business customers licensing our cloud services has more than tripled in the last year. In education, we now have over 10,000 schools and 11 million students signed up for our Live@edu  service. On October 19, we announced the next generation of our cloud productivity service, Office 365. Office 365 brings together Lync, SharePoint, Exchange and Office Professional plus Desktop software in an always up-to-date cloud service, and is designed to meet the needs of organizations of all types and sizes. From a business model perspective, Office 365 creates new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners and enables new scenarios that weren't viable in the past. With Office 365, we can reach more people, we will sell more to each customer and we will increase customer satisfaction. Office 365 will be available worldwide in calendar 2011. Okay. Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, which grew 27%, reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. We sold 2.8 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 38%. In the U.S., the new Xbox 360 console has outsold all other platforms since its introduction, resulting in a record first quarter shipment. Halo Reach also had a solid launch this quarter, reaching approximately $350 million in revenue. The Halo effect extended to Xbox Live, which continues strong membership growth this quarter. Windows Phone 7 launched last week in Europe and Asia and we eagerly anticipate the introduction in the U.S. on November 8. Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 10% to $3.1 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6%. In the first quarter, we repurchased $4 billion of shares, returned $1.4 billion through dividend and increased our dividend rate 23%. So in summary, we're off to a great financial start for the year with 24% bookings growth. We've seen strong business spending across Windows, Server & Tools and the Microsoft Business Division in both traditional and cloud offering, and our cloud momentum continued, our consumer momentum continued. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to continue to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Great. Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to many recent surveys, Enterprise IT spend should continue to grow for the remainder of the fiscal year. With the depth and breadth of our offerings, we are well-positioned to grow our share of the IT spending market. We expect business PC and server hardware purchasing to remain the high priority for most businesses. The business PC refresh cycle should continue through at least the remainder of this fiscal year. As was the case this quarter, we expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, and emerging market growth to outpace developed market growth. And we're confident that tablets will expand the PC market and we're enthusiastic about our opportunity, along with our partners, to bring Windows to additional form factors and new usage scenario. Windows will continue to provide the choice and value that customers want across devices. With that back up, I'll now turn to segment expectation. Windows division revenue should go roughly in line with the PC market for the second quarter and the full year, when excluding the impact of the prior-year Tech Guarantee and revenue attributed to the launch spike. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $1.7 billion of revenue related to the Tech Guarantee and $600 million of revenue related to the launch spike. For the full year, you should exclude $300 million and $700 million, respectively, the latest of these events. Moving on to Server & Tools. For Q2 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 50% of the total, should grow high-single digits for the second quarter and low-double digits for the full fiscal year. Services, which is the remaining 20%, should grow mid-single digits for both the second quarter and the full fiscal year. Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division. Consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, should continue to track the PC shipment growth rates for the second quarter and the fiscal year. We also expect revenue associated with multiyear agreements representing 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and the fiscal year, as we slowly start to recognize the higher growth billings going on to the balance sheet. When updating your model, you should remember that next quarter, in addition to the framework I just provided, you will also recognize approximately $220 million of deferred revenue related to Tech Guarantee. For Q2 and the full fiscal year, we expect Online Services division revenue to outperform the online advertising market, reflecting continued organic revenue growth, as well as new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership. The majority of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net traffic acquisition costs. We expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually for the next several quarters. And finally, in the Entertainment and Devices division, we're very excited about the launch of Windows Phone 7 and we anticipate that Connect will be the guest this holiday season. Considering the momentum and high-level of consumer interest in our offerings, we expect this division's revenue to go roughly 30% for the second quarter and in the mid-20s for the full fiscal year. Switching to cost of goods sold expectations for the company, the biggest factor impacting COGS next quarter will be the expected and significant increase in hardware sales due to the upcoming launch of Kinect. Obviously, Xbox consoles and Kinect have a higher COGS profile relative to revenue than the rest of our business and you should consider this impacting your model. Turning to operating expenses, we continue to prioritize our investment and remain diligent on cost controls. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect the low interest-rate environment we experienced in the first quarter to continue through the second quarter and the fiscal year, and for investment income to be fairly consistent with the first quarter level. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the second quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns, excluding the $220 million impact of the Tech Guarantees. So with that color for Q2 and the rest of our fiscal year, I want to close by saying that we are extremely pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. We executed well in all of our core focus areas. Products and services we brought to market over the past year are being embraced by our customers. And as a result, our product portfolio is as strong as it has ever been. This, combined with our continued prioritization of investment into the highest growth opportunities will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth. With that, let's take some questions. Bill?\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible. So please stick to one question and avoid long or multipart questions. Barb, can you please go ahead, and repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Holt: My question is about Office. Obviously, also a very good start for 2010. As you look back at 2007 business growth, by which exceeded 20% for a number of quarters. As you think about the internals in terms of penetration and duration of this cycle, what are your early thoughts about how like they'd compared and where are you seeing evidence on successor on some of the bundling that you have talked about.\nPeter Klein: Yes, at a high level, certainly, I'd point you to the guidance framework that we just talked about on what we expect relative to the business PC market. And obviously, the business hardware refresh is a great underlying driver for that business, as well as excitement around the product. And in terms of Office, I think the thing that's most encouraging for me is the breadth of the strength around and across all customer segments, whether that was small- and medium-size businesses and Enterprises. In terms of the integration story, Bill touched on the strong growth across all of those businesses and I think you're really starting to see that resonate very well with customers. And in fact, as we had anticipated when we were talking about anticipating off of 2010, and that was going to be a key part of the story and I think we're starting to see that play out early days, which I think can sustain for a while.\nOperator: And next is Heather Bellini with ISI Group.\nHeather Bellini: Peter, I was wondering, you mentioned that the Enterprise 7 -- Windows 7 Enterprise Upgrade cycle would last at least through the end of fiscal '11. And I guess I'm just wondering if you could share with us how the upgrade cycle itself is tracking versus your expectations from a few quarters ago?\nPeter Klein: Yes, I would say two things. One, just in terms of Enterprise's desire to upgrade, very strong, sort of high level. I think what we're seeing is people actually doing their deployments a little bit faster than I think we expected than we'd seen in the past. In terms of the overall business, obviously we're seeing Enterprise and businesses refresh their hardware, which is obviously a great thing in terms of the Windows 7 business.\nOperator: The next is Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Bill, Peter, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about just Enterprise Agreements in general. And we're certainly not back to a normal economic environment but your performance there, especially the improvements over the last several quarters here seems to suggest that maybe you are getting back to kind of normal behavior from customers despite headcount being pressured. I'm just wondering if you can talk to us about what you're seeing as the drivers of growth in that part of the business more generally?\nPeter Klein: I think you're seeing the console and some several things. Obviously, one is just macroeconomics and businesses investing in IT again. And I think the other is that our product portfolio, and through the combination of those two things has gotten Enterprises really wanting to invest both in their IT infrastructure and in our portfolio of products. And so as we had hoped in the course of the last year, we thought those two things might come together. The last thing I'll say is the accelerated interest in the cloud. It's when you add on top of it where we've come in terms of our cloud offerings and what that means for Enterprises as they think about investing for the long term. They want to invest with somebody who can make the transition from their own premise infrastructure to the cloud as soon as possible. And I think you're seeing that as well. So the conversations that we're having always included our new product portfolio, as well as our cloud offerings. And I think that taking into account the better macroeconomic environment has all come together to really drive a better environment.\nOperator: And next is Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.\nSarah Friar: Peter, on the cost side, you have tremendous operating margins this quarter. As you look forward, you maintained the cost goal for the full year. Is that an anticipation of what's coming around the Windows Phone launch and Connect, or are there ways to continue to see you be a lot more efficient on the cost side over the next couple of quarters?\nPeter Klein: As you know, we're always looking at ways to get as efficient as we can on the cost. And right now, we're executing against the plan, we feel very good about our plans we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters. And first quarter was good, and we continue to executing at that plan. I'm not seeing in Q2, we do have some launches coming out and that was always in our plan and those are starting off and going on very well.\nOperator: And next is from Brent Thill with UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter, if you could drill one level deeper in the covered to an inning, maybe give us a sense of what inning you think we're in, in terms of the corporate upgrade?\nPeter Klein: In our guidance, we talked about the rest of this year. I think we have to see how that plays out. That's sort of where we have visibility and what we're talking about. But certainly, over the last couple of quarters, looking forward over the next couple of quarters and then talking to customers in what they're looking to invest in, clearly our priority is investing in refreshing their hardware and the related Microsoft products that come along with that.\nOperator: And next is Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Just wanted to focus on the Server & Tools division for a minute. Peter, what are your OEM partner's telling you about just where we stand in the server refresh cycle and how much do they see these sort of being high growth as what we're seeing in service and should either continuing or not continuing into next year?\nPeter Klein: Similar to PCs, I think it's a similar dynamic. These businesses are investing broadly in their infrastructure whether that's PCs or servers. And on our outlook, we talked about how we expect that to continue for the rest of this fiscal year. So it's very similar to what we just talked about in terms of the PC refresh.\nOperator: And next is Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.\nKatherine Egbert: And if I do some math, I come up with about 40% of you revenue coming from all consumer sources and about 60% business. It looks like the consumer revenue was about flat year-on-year and the business revenues growing high teens. Is that accurate?\nPeter Klein: Well, yes. It's hard to answer that question because I don't know exactly your math. I will point out a couple of key highlights on the consumer side. If you look at Entertainment and Devices, the Xbox growth of 27%. That's something that we feel really good about and gives us great momentum heading into the holidays with Kinect, and the same thing with our Search revenue outgrowing the market. So those are the sort of the key highlight.\nBill Koefoed: And Consumer and Office was up 26%\nPeter Klein: Correct. So we actually feel really good about the consumer revs. It's hard to answer that specific question without ...\nBill Koefoed: We feel good about the business growth so it was a good quarter for both.\nOperator: And next is Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: It's good to see the cash flow and the operating margins, also you bought back a ton of stock in the quarter. My question is about growth. I just want to answer this from a quantitative standpoint. Incrementally rounded to the last two quarters, what's your confidence level in your growth there? I just noticed some of the forward-looking indicators, your business tends to lag with all the spending because you have this annuity model for the most part. Look at the unbilled portion, and that's at a record high. You're renewals, you better priced better than before. The first half have given nicely. What is your incremental confidence with respect to your revenue growth rate considering expenses tied up, I would assume that there's a lot of operating leverage for that incremental revenue. Talk to us about your confidence in your revenue growth outlook?\nPeter Klein: Obviously, we feel pretty good. We had such a strong performance in the business side. And that flow through, if you look at our outlook on the annuity side to your point, we've slightly increased our annuity revenue outlook in MBD and STD, which reflects the strength in the billings that we've seen. And as you pointed out, it takes time for that to flow through to the income statement and it will throughout the rest of the year.\nOperator: And next is John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase.\nJohn DiFucci: Peter, my question has to do with PC market, PC sales, unit sales. You and your Windows OEM revenue bridge, which is always very helpful. You start off from PC market with 10% growth. But industry analysts are coming out and I know, you're not doing their work, but it's actually quite different from what we've seen out there from an industry analysts by about 2.5%, in this quarter, which is a bigger range than we usually see. Just wondering, can you just help us out a little bit with that because little things come out throughout the quarter and we take a look at those, and we realize that a lot of your, at least the Windows business and also MBD and with the Office is driven by that, fairly significantly driven by that. Any comments on that, the difference?\nBill Koefoed: Actually, John, I'll take that. So IDC said 10% and Gartner said 8%, so our range of 9% to 11% was slightly higher than Gartner's and IDC is within the mid-range. So we feel like our analysis of the PC market obviously, we look at those data points as well as others, which is completely in line. So happy to talk to you about it after the call, one-on-one, call down if you want.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.\nJason Maynard: I just have a question on Windows 7. The premium mix was pretty good this quarter. I'm just curious, in light of your commentary about the Enterprise adoption cycle, it's fair to say you're anticipating sort of similar levels pointing out there in terms of how that percentage mix plays out for the rest of the year?\nBill Koefoed: Yes, generally speaking, the biggest factor in premium mix is going to be the business mix, and as we talked about, we expected those dynamics to continue for the rest of this year.\nOperator: And next is Brad Reback with Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: So Bill, I think you had highlighted earlier in the call the big win with the Office 365 product at New York. It was a fairly competitive bid, it looks like. Could you guys maybe talk to what the economics of that look like to you from a profitability standpoint over the life of that contract? Clearly, a lot of consumers as people move to the cloud that, that could negatively impact the P&L. So maybe you could talk to a real world example.\nPeter Klein: Bill touched a little bit on the business model. We talked about this a little bit at our Analyst Meeting. These kind of wins and these cloud deals, it provides totally new economic opportunity for us. These are scenarios that we're not in today. In many cases, their customers have that customers today. In some cases, it's revenue than we may have for them to think us that we're not getting. Sitting in New York is a perfect example. We have others like Starbucks and others, where we're addressing totally new scenarios, Azure is a great example of that. It  really increases our penetration in that market. Similarly, we've talked about how in the mid-market we can really increase our penetration services like this. So that's sort of our business model how it creates economic profit for us.\nOperator: And next is Edward Maguire with CLSA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. Looking at the double-digit growth in your Business division products, could you talk about what's driving that and how closely that growth may be linked to the Windows 7 activity?\nPeter Klein: Yes, it's not really tied to the Windows 7 activity. It's more a function of the product cycle with Office 2010 and all the related products like SharePoint and Exchange and Lync. And as we touched on briefly before, so if the confluence of the macroeconomic environment picking up and Enterprises investing in their infrastructure, they're seeing the value that you'd get the increased productivity and the cost savings that you get. And that's what's really driving the interest in those products, and new versions of those products that just introduce capabilities that manufactures really want.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.\nGregg Moskowitz: Peter, you mentioned that the Windows Server Premium mix was up four points. So I think you're now at 29%. And I believe that at least a few quarters back, Microsoft has suggested that it would be difficult to get this above 30%. Is that still kind of the ceiling we should be thinking about? Or do you think given this momentum that you could drive the premium mix higher than that?\nPeter Klein: Well, first thing I'd say is the premium mix is over 20%. We haven't given an exact number on that. It's probably, I think it's best to continue to track it and not sort of set a ceiling or an expectation for it.\nBill Koefoed: Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. As many of you know, today's a busy day for us here in Redmond, as we have PDC going on here. I'd encourage you, if you haven't, to look into the replays of the keynotes that we've done at PDC. We also look forward to seeing many of you at a number of call conferences we'll be participating in this quarter. For those who of you are unable to attend in person, you'll be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need any additional details. Thanks, again for joining us today and take care.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thank, Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. We started the fiscal year with good momentum and closed with a solid finish. Throughout the year we delivered top line growth and remained disciplined on cost management while continuing to execute on our product roadmap. Our enterprise products and services remain a top priority for CIOs as they navigate macroeconomic challenges. They are adopting our solutions for increased productivity, manageability, and security at an overall lower total cost of ownership. Windows 7 and Office 2010 both reached new milestones as enterprises benefit from our business desktop offerings. Today over 50% of enterprise desktops worldwide are running Windows 7 and software assurance attach rates are at an all-time high. And even two years after launch, Office 2010 attach continues to grow as businesses make long-term commitments to the Office platform. Our productivity server offerings continue to perform very well with double-digit growth. Our newest server offering, Lync, grew over 45% this quarter, and we are excited about the unified communication scenarios that are enabled by new voice, video and social capabilities. Office remains the number one productivity application and today is on more than 1 billion PCs worldwide. On Monday we released a customer preview of the new Office, which puts mobility, social and cloud at the forefront. Combined with the power of Windows 8, we are enabling a new platform of computing that gives the end-user unparalleled choice for consumption and productivity. Our Server & Tools products deliver on the vision of the modern data center by enabling multi-tenancy, scalability and continuous services, all while using a single pane of glass for management. No other technology company can offer the hybrid cloud solutions that give customers the ability to manage and scale their applications, data and processes across both public and private clouds. As I look back when I first became CFO of Server & Tools in 2003, it was a $7 billion business. Since then it has grown to nearly $19 billion in revenue and the opportunity for future growth has never been better. Xbox continued its evolution as an entertainment platform and has solidified its place in the living room. With the help of Kinect and Bing, discovering and accessing content has never been easier. And with the recently announced Xbox SmartGlass, we look to make entertainment smarter, more interactive and more fun. Moving to the Online Services Division, we continue to grow share, increase revenue per search and improve operating performance. Despite this progress, our expectations for future growth and profitability are now lower than we previously expected. As we announced earlier this month, we took a write-down on the goodwill that arose mainly from the aQuantive acquisition. We continue to believe that search is a strategic asset for Microsoft and are prioritizing our resources into the areas we believe drive the most business value. With Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, we see a great opportunity to benefit from the trend towards smart mobile devices. We feel that we are uniquely positioned to address the security and manageability challenges that CIOs are dealing with today as a result of this trend. And for users, we offer compelling experiences across devices with data and services that are connected seamlessly via the cloud. In summary, we delivered solid financial results while embarking on the largest launch wave in our history. We are pleased with the long-term commitment that enterprise customers are making to our offerings as it demonstrates the high level of confidence in our product and service roadmap. Importantly, customer satisfaction is at an all time high. This past year we delivered significant product releases such as SQL Server 2012, System Center 2012, and updates from Azure, Bing, and Xbox LIVE, and enthusiasm is building for the coming year that includes important releases from Windows, Windows Phone, Office and Windows Server. With those thoughts, I will hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results, and then I will come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $18.6 billion, up 7% or $1.2 billion. Operating income was $6.9 billion, up 12%. Earnings per share was $0.73, up 6%. Cash flow from operations was $7.7 billion, up 29%, and for the full year it was a record $31.6 billion. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. From a geographic perspective, developed markets grew mid-single digits and we saw continued double-digit growth in emerging markets. We delivered solid financial results despite a tough economic environment which demonstrates the strength and breadth of our businesses. Our compelling product portfolio across Windows Server and Tools in the Microsoft Business Division is driving strong demand from small businesses to the largest global enterprises. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 14% and made up over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Unearned revenue was a record $19.5 billion, up 14% and our contracted-not-billed balance was over $19.5 billion. Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the worldwide PC market was roughly flat this quarter with approximately 85 million PCs sold. Business PCs were up 1% and consumer PCs were down 2%. Next, I'll move on to the results for the Windows & Windows Live Division, where revenue was generally in line with the PC market. As in past quarters, you will find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Adoption of Windows 7 remained strong especially among enterprises, which are benefiting from the security and management capabilities that come with the operating system. This quarter volume licensing revenue grew double-digits. During the quarter, we launched the release preview of Windows 8 to a positive reception, and we recently announced that Windows 8 will reach general availability on October 26. Windows 8 represents a significant opportunity for developers, OEMs and other partners to extend a new range of form factors, capabilities and scenarios to billions of people around the world. Now, I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 7%. Business revenue grew 9% and within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 2% driven by higher attach worldwide. Consumer revenue declined 4% reflecting consumer PC dynamics in developed markets which was partially offset by higher attach rates. We saw strong growth in our productivity server offerings with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively growing double-digits this quarter. CIOs continue to invest in our application roadmap and new productivity scenarios. As Peter mentioned, Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 45% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform. We believe unified communications is a huge market opportunity and we are pleased to see these results. Just a year ago we introduced Office 365. It is now offered in 88 markets and 32 languages. In just one year some of the biggest global brands have embraced Office 365 to share information and connect with customers and partners. Global brands such as Lowe\u2019s, Qantas, Japan Airlines and Hallmark Cards have adopted Office 365 to unify their communication and collaboration experience with a secure trusted platform. Earlier this week we released the customer preview of the next version of Office. It features an intuitive design that works great on Windows 8 with touch, stylus, mouse or keyboard. It is available as a cloud-based subscription service and includes Skype credits and extra SkyDrive storage. With SkyDrive integration, content is always available across all types of devices. It enables modern scenarios such as digital note taking, reading and markup. It is social and makes it easier to connect with people and information. With People Card, there is an integrated view of contacts from LinkedIn and Facebook. And speaking of social, this morning we announced that we have closed the Yammer acquisition. The Yammer adds best-in-class enterprise social networking to our portfolio of cloud-based productivity services. Dynamics revenue grew 7% and within that Dynamic CRM revenue grew over 25% and added 360,000 users this quarter. We now have more than 2.7 million users and 36,000 customers that use Dynamic CRM to get a consistent and familiar experience inside Office. Now let's move to Server & Tools which posted another solid quarter with 13% revenue growth; transactional revenue declined low-single digits while multi-year licensing revenue grew more than 20%, fueled by the wave of our new server products. Enterprise services grew 15%. In the private cloud, Windows Server Premium revenue grew double-digits. With greater scalability, improved performance and cost efficiencies, Hyper-V continues to win share against VMware. In anticipation of what is coming in Windows Server 2012, we are already seeing customers like Unilever move from VMware to Hyper-V. System Center revenue grew roughly 20% and we continued building momentum and demand for our private cloud capabilities. With the release of System Center 2012 and our leadership in Windows Server Active Directory, we have a compelling device management and application delivery platform. In the public cloud we launched a major release of Windows Azure, which enables infrastructure-as-a-service capabilities, adds 48 countries, offers media services, and brings new capabilities to developers. We are excited that Windows Azure Media Services is being used to deliver Olympics coverage in high-definition. This quarter Windows Azure had significant customer and partner wins and we added roughly 800 new enterprise customers. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 20% outpacing industry growth. Every week, we see customers moving to SQL Server because of its superior business analytic, security, flexibility and cost-effectiveness. SQL Server Premium revenue grew more than 30% as enterprises continued to deploy it for their mission critical workloads and business intelligence needs. High-performance and BI capabilities offered by SQL Server 2012 along with Hadoop integration will enable our customers to capture the full potential of Big Data. As I look back at the year, SQL Server revenue grew more than $0.5 billion, and with the technology advancements in SQL Server 2012, we are well positioned for future growth. Next, I will move on to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 8% and operating performance improved by $266 million or 36%. Online advertising revenue was up 12% driven primarily by rate improvement in our search business. Bing\u2019s U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.6%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue grew 20%. Despite the soft console market, Xbox continues its leadership position and has 47% share of the U.S. market in June. Additionally, Xbox LIVE membership increased by more than 15%, driven in part by the new content partners we had brought to Xbox. We also announced Xbox SmartGlass which will connect phones, PCs and tablets with the Xbox 360 console to enable more interactive and engaging entertainment. For Windows Phone, there are now approximately 100,000 apps in the marketplace and Windows Phone unit sales grew more than 50% sequentially. In June, we announced that Windows Phone 8 will arrive later this year. Windows Phone 8 is based on the same core technologies that power Windows 8 and it will unleash a new wave of features for consumers, developers and businesses. Moving on to Skype. We continue to progress with the integration and you got a taste of that with our office announcement this week. This quarter 115 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of over 50% from the prior year. I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Costs of goods sold increased 12% primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs, and growth in enterprise services. Operating expenses were flat at $7.5 billion. Operating income increased 12% to $6.9 billion. This quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. So to wrap up, we saw a strong demand from our business customers leading to solid financial results. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to maintain strong cost discipline and drive operating margin expansion. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter, who is going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013. As we look forward, we expect many of the trends from 2012 to continue. Companies will prioritize the transition to the modern desktop. CIOs will continue to invest in cloud solutions to deliver productivity, scalability to their business. Consumers will increasingly leverage cloud services to ensure their content is always available across any of their devices. Rapid innovation will continue in hardware, services and the underlying infrastructure that is needed to support mobile computing. With our current portfolio and roadmap we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. Now turning to our outlook by business. For Windows, in the first quarter we expect to defer $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to the Windows upgrade offer and presales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability. Just a reminder that amounts deferred for the Windows upgrade offer will get recognized upon the earlier of redemption or the expiration of the program on February 28, 2013. We expect the current dynamics of the PC marketplace to continue in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the deferrals associated with the Windows Upgrade Offer and pre-sales, we expect Windows revenue to slightly trail the PC market for the quarter. With new touch-enabled features in Windows 8 and new form factors hitting the market this fall, we expect Windows 8 to drive the PC ecosystem forward. Excluding the deferrals from fiscal year 2012, for the year we expect Windows revenue to be roughly in line with the PC market. Note that this does not include the impact of Surface PCs which we will update you on in the coming months. In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division\u2019s total, should grow low double-digits for both the first quarter and full-year. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market until the launch of Office due to the normal cyclical slowdown in advance of the next version, and then slightly outperform the PC market post-launch. Within Server and Tools, our customers are moving from transactional licensing into multi-year licensing agreements. This impacts our mix of revenue, and for next year we expect multi-year licensing to be approximately 60% of the division\u2019s revenue, transactional licensing to be 20%, and Enterprise Services to remain at 20%. With the shift to multi-year agreements, we expect transactional revenue to slightly lag the overall server hardware market for the first quarter and full-year. For both the first quarter and the year, we expect multi-year licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low-teens. In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization, with focused investment in the highest value areas. For our Entertainment and Devices Division, while we have been maintaining our share leadership position, the console market has been showing year-over-year declines. For games, Halo 4 will launch in Q2, while Gears of War was a Q1 title last year. With these considerations in mind, we expect revenue to decline high-teens in the first quarter, and to be roughly flat for the full-year. We expect COGS to grow high-single digits in the first quarter, due primarily to the Nokia payments, addition of Skype and growth in Enterprise Services, partially offset by lower console volumes. We are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses of 30.3 to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2013, and as you create your models, you should expect higher expense growth rates around the timing of launches. As a reminder, Other Income includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset, absent one-time events. For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, and capital expenditures to be slightly over $3 billion. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer and pre-sales, we expect unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth patterns for the first quarter. In summary, we delivered solid financial results in both the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. We enter fiscal 2013 with great momentum and are excited about our upcoming launches. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill, and we will take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. We want to get the questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi part questions. Sharon, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAdam Holt: In past Windows cycles, commercial and retail licensing and inventory rebuild have enabled you to outpace the PC market, how should we think about those factors around Windows 8, and are you including OEM related tablet sales in your PC market forecast for next year or should we be excluding those like Surface. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Well the first question I will go back to the guidance we gave for how we expect Windows to really ignite the PC market and how we (inaudible) to do relative to the PC market. Obviously, we said it was going to lag a little bit in the first quarter prelaunch and for the full-year, would be roughly in line, so obviously that means for the remainder of the year slightly ahead. And also think about some of our emerging markets versus developed markets and what that means for the overall growth of Windows relative to the hardware market. On the second question on the PC market, I\u2019d say when we talk about the PC market we are largely consistent with how the third parties would report on the PC market traditionally.\nOperator: Next we have Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open.\nRick Sherlund: On Office 365, I\u2019m kind of curious how we should be thinking about how that revenue ramps up. You haven\u2019t really talked much yet about the availability of Office 365. I know it's included with the WinRT, should we expect then that it's broadly available in the market with October 26th launch date of Windows 8?\nBill Koefoed: I think generally you're characterizing it correctly. We were really excited about the new Office and what that means for Office 365 being broadly available for both consumers and enterprises, and we do think this is a real accelerant for the business. Today, it's been a really compelling part of the overall Office story. We talk with every customer about the cloud roadmap, and that\u2019s one of the drivers of what we're seeing broadly across MBD, not just in Office, but in SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. And I think you\u2019re thinking about this right that when we get to the new Office in conjunction with Windows 8 we really accelerate what we are doing for both consumers as well as businesses of all sizes.\nOperator: Next we have Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler: Yahoo! in their earnings call on Tuesday reported that the revenue per search they are getting from Microsoft is below the Microsoft guarantee threshold and that the guarantee expires Q1 2013 I guess, Q1 2013. CFO alluded to a clause in the search agreement because Yahoo! went out that there is no parity, first, is this correct? And second, what if any impact would this have on the search strategy if they decided to break this agreement?\nPeter Klein: What I\u2019ll tell you Mark we are sort of laser-beam focused on the partnership that we have with Yahoo! We\u2019ve be very encouraged with the year-over-year improvements we have seen over the last several quarters. And to be honest 100% of our focus right now is on making sure we continue to drive those gains which will benefit both parties of the partnership and make sure that\u2019s successful for both companies because it\u2019s obviously very strategic for both of us.\nOperator: Next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeather Bellini: Peter, you mentioned on the call the increase in Server and Tools multi-year licensing revenue as a percentage of the total segment. I was wondering if you could walk us through kind of what the biggest drivers are behind that and should we expect kind of the trajectory you are seeing here to continue?\nPeter Klein: The biggest piece of that we are seeing is SQL and we are getting so much great traction with big enterprises really starting to make progress in tier 1 applications and what we are seeing now is many more long-term multi-year agreements for SQL, which used to be more of a transactional business, but now as bigger companies are making their commitment to our data platform, putting their mission-critical applications on it, they are signing more of a new kind of licensing that we had just for SQL for multi-year licensing agreements. So by far the biggest impact is in SQL, and yes with the new version of SQL Server 2012 we expect that to continue.\nBill Koefoed: Just to add on I mentioned in my script that year-over-year revenue for SQL was up over $0.5 billion. So, just awesome momentum in SQL in the database business and our competitive strategy in the marketplace has just really been playing out.\nOperator: Next we have Walter Pritchard of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nWalter Pritchard: I wanted to just ask a follow-up or ask a question on the contracted backlog. I know we are accustomed to looking at that with the unearned number. But it looks like that number, if I look at the sequential trend there it was a little wide of what we have seen on similar Q4s where you have seen a more robust quarter-over-quarter growth. I\u2019m just wondering, was there something about the shape of the enterprise annuity business or what you saw in the quarter that caused that?\nPeter Klein: No, as you pointed out, we tend to look at it all up on our annuity business, both contracted as well as the unearned and taken as a whole. We\u2019re obviously very pleased with what we are doing. We\u2019re pleased with the performance we\u2019ve had with our customers, we\u2019re pleased with the renewal rates, we\u2019re pleased with the trend that we just talked about with SQL. I wouldn\u2019t highlight anything unusual there.\nBill Koefoed: I\u2019d just add on that our enterprise agreement renewal rate was certainly within if not at the higher end of our historical range. So, we feel really good about the execution of the sales force this quarter and I think that that definitely played out towards the end of the fiscal year.\nOperator: Next we have Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nPhil Winslow: Just want to focus go back on the EDD division, you talked about relatively flattish revenue. You gave a lot of color on your mix in terms of the revenue contributions there. But when you think about the operating expenses and the profitability of that business, what would you expect this coming fiscal year and this point in the cycle?\nPeter Klein: When I think about E&D, I feel really good about the evolution of the business model for the entertainment business, you have seen us really add the content partners that we have and grow the Xbox LIVE business. And so historically the profitability has been largely sensitive to the console market and that\u2019s still a big piece of it, but as we broadened our business, we now are at different revenue streams. And obviously the other thing I\u2019d say is with Halo 4 coming later this year, having a really high first-party title is always a great thing from a profit perspective. So, when you think about the business model going forward, I feel great about some of the content is coming. I feel great about the subscription with Xbox LIVE and some of the access and discoverability we have with Kinect and Bing as well.\nOperator: Next we have Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Peter you had really strong multi-year operating margin improvement in the Server business and I was just curious if you could give us a sense of what you are seeing that\u2019s causing that and how should we think about that going forward in terms of that trajectory?\nPeter Klein: As that business has really accelerated and shown great revenue growth. We are obviously getting the benefits of the scale that you get right, because a lot of the expenses are R&D expense and so, we\u2019ve really been able to improve those margins at the same that we have been building out, both the public and private cloud assets as well. And you heard me talk about before, we\u2019re really encouraged by the trajectory of that business and we think there is continued headroom from that perspective.\nBill Koefoed: I\u2019d just add on, I think as when (inaudible) spoke at one of the conferences this past year, I think he just talked about the fact that our roadmap there is something that enterprises are really buying into because, I mean use this term hybrid cloud and he talked about, this as a strategy of working with enterprises to focus on their on-premise capability, as well as their public cloud capability and being able to offer the opportunity for people to kind of manage that interchangeably. And we really feel like we\u2019ve got just a unique set of capabilities there, and as Peter said, we\u2019ve been making a lot of investment there and you are really seeing that show up in our revenue growth.\nOperator: Next we have Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Is the PC market, if you were to include the Windows OEM tablet, as well, Windows tablet really grow faster than conventional PCs. Would you be able to stick to your comment that Windows revenue would grow in line with the PC market?\nBill Koefoed: Let me take that. So, I mean I think Peter talked about this just a second ago, but there is just a whole bunch of kind of moving pieces in there. He talked about there is emerging markets that are growing faster than developed markets. Obviously, there is a different pricing, we have different prices in emerging markets than we do in developed markets. Obviously, there is also some upgrade revenue that we\u2019d be recognizing during this year. I think Kash to your point, there could be some tablet growth. I mean to be honest, it could grow faster but at the same time these best estimates that we have is that we\u2019re going to grow in line with all the information that we have available.\nOperator: Next we have John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: My question has to do with the Server and Tools business. I guess when I back into what the transactional business is, I guess the question is did it decline this quarter, and when I look at the guidance you are giving. Peter, why would the transactional business slightly lag the hardware market? I think that sort of implies that you are losing share now? I think that that's what\u2019s happening out there. Can you help me a little bit with this?\nPeter Klein: You are right. It's not losing share, but it's transitioning to the multi-year licensing business for both Windows Server and SQL Server. So that's really what we are seeing, and Bill gave you some of the numbers when he was talking about some of the growth in SQL Server revenue and just all-out multi-year licensing business for the Server & Tools business. It's really just a mix to the multi-year agreements which we love, because it\u2019s people making longer-term commitments to the platform.\nJohn DiFucci: So these are people that had been buying transactional that are moving to multi-year, because it sounded a little bit like they were large enterprises that might have been shifting and buying more Windows than they would have brought other stuff in the past?\nPeter Klein: In general, in total when people are buying new Server & Tools products, they are more often going to multiyear licensing agreements than transaction where that wasn\u2019t as much the case in the past.\nOperator: Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.\nBrendan Barnicle: You mentioned that in SQL Server 2012, you\u2019re going to have Hadoop support. I was wondering if you could give us anymore details on what you are planning there and what we might look for in terms of functionality that's going to be enhanced with the Hadoop support edition?\nBill Koefoed: Brendan, neither Peter and I are probably technically savvy enough to be able to offer a great answer on that one, but we are happy to get somebody from the Server & Tools business who can go deep on the technology and we\u2019d love to talk about what we are doing around that and certainly arrange a follow-up call with you in the future if so. Thanks for the question and we\u2019ll follow-up with you.\nOperator: Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Going back to Adam\u2019s question at the beginning, if you think about the timing of the Windows 8 launch and the impact it has on the financials, is there anything that we should think differently this time given that you have like new form factors, the tablets are coming in, your OEM partners still need to come up. So, if you try to model this financial impact, do we need to be aware of a slight delay there compared to previous cycles?\nPeter Klein: Well, I\u2019d refer you to the guidance that I gave when we look forward and the general answer would be like in previous launches we are incredibly excited about their capabilities, probably more excited about what we are doing with Windows 8 and reimagining what you can do with Windows. And in particular what we are doing and what our OEM partners are doing to deliver really cool devices and really exciting form factors. So, the general answer is, no we are probably more excited about this launch than any launch in a long time.\nOperator: Colin Gillis with BGC Financials. Your line is open.\nColin Gillis: I just want to follow-up on the transition from transactional to long-term agreements and also the success with the renewals, can you just give a few factors for this? Is it the product roadmap? Is it cost savings?\nPeter Klein: It's actually all of those things. Certainly the product roadmap and the new capabilities that we have across the board whether that's System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012 which is now and what\u2019s coming in Windows Server later this year as well as the public-private cloud story which really, really resonates. So what people are investing in is that roadmap, because they see where they are going long-term and they are partnering with us to get where they need to get long-term through their increased capabilities and our technology. And I\u2019d add that total cost of ownership does play a big piece of that particularly on the SQL side.\nOperator: Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is open.\nEd Maguire: I\u2019d like to come back to Server & Tools. You mentioned Lync was growing 45%. What's behind that? Is it competitive wins or new implementations or attach in multi-component deals and also if you could address the impact of some of the licensing changes on the growth in SQL Server?\nPeter Klein: So, let me start with Lync. And I will try and tame myself because I just love Lync. The reason it's growing so fast is because of the capabilities that it provides as well as the cost savings it provides for a company. It's really compelling and it really resonates well with customers. It\u2019s a lot of new implementation, some of its competitive, some of its just new application that people think of really reimagining how communications happens. We are really excited at one place where Skype acquisition plays in and kind of what we showed a little bit this week with how we are really reimagining communications broadly for all of our customers. And that story really resonates very well. It's very easy to sell. It's very easy to see. The capabilities are very easy to show. So, that's just a great product, a great set of capability, a great value proposition for CIOs and end-users alike. And as Bill said, we think unified communication is a really big market opportunity for us, and we felt that for a longtime, and we are really starting to see it with this version of Lync, and what we are doing going forward.\nOperator: Next we have Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: The premium mix went down 6 points sequentially and was lower than we have seen in a while. Just wondering if you think a fair amount of this was perhaps driven by the Windows 8 program, where users can pay one price upgrade regardless of what Win 7 SKU that they buy or was it due to emerging markets and other factors?\nPeter Klein: Mostly emerging markets. You are right about that.\nOperator: Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Peter, you talked about CapEx being about 3 billion. It's been running at about 2, 2.3 the last couple of years so about a 30% increase. What's that predominantly related to?\nPeter Klein: Mostly related to the increase in our cloud businesses across the boards, and some we\u2019re getting good adoption and acceleration. So, it's a little bit of an increased related across the board as Office 365 capacity.\nBill Koefoed: Okay, great. So, that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. We hope you all have a great summer. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we will be participating this quarter. For those of you unable to attend in person, you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need any additional details.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance as we delivered another quarter of solid financial results. Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services drove revenue growth of 6% to a third quarter record $17.4 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for one of our biggest launch years, we delivered operating income growth of 12%. Let me provide more color on the business. Our Business Desktop offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. This quarter, businesses continued to refresh their hardware. And as a result, we saw healthy growth in business PCs around the world. As they purchase new PCs, businesses are also deploying Windows 7 and Office 2010 to increase productivity and manageability while reducing their total cost of ownership. Today, approximately 40% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7, and we see continued momentum as the remaining desktops upgrade from Windows XP over the next 2 years. As CIOs look to address the needs of a more social and mobile workforce. Our productivity services such as Office 365 have become an important solution. Our communication and collaboration offerings such as Exchange, SharePoint and Lync all grew revenue double digits and are well positioned in this growing market. On the infrastructure side, the Server & Tools Business delivered double-digit revenue growth, with SQL Server leading the way. We've now launched System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012, and the new versions of Windows Server and Visual Studio are on the horizon. Our product roadmap and vision are driving new customer wins and strong Enterprise Agreement renewals. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to address the needs of CIOs as they strive to efficiently manage private and public clouds. Establishing a vibrant Windows Phone ecosystem is a priority for us, and we are working with our partners, including Nokia, to enable more features, markets and devices. We are pleased with our Nokia partnership and the pace of innovation across devices, including the Lumia 900, which recently launched on AT&T's 4G LTE network. In gaming and entertainment, while industry console sales were softer than our expectations, we continue to maintain our shared leadership position. With Xbox LIVE, we are adding more content and partners as we expand the entertainment experience and build on our leading position in the living room. And in Search, we are focused on addressing RPS and operating performance. We are seeing our hard work pay off with year-over-year improvements in both areas. In summary, solid revenue growth, and our ongoing commitment to fiscal discipline delivered strong financial results. We are enthusiastic about the market reception to our products and services as we continue to execute well, heading into our launch wave. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results, then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 16% or roughly $1 billion. Operating income was up 12% to $6.4 billion, cash flow from operations was a record $9.6 billion and earnings per share was $0.60. Remember, in Q3 last year, we had a $461 million or $0.05 per share benefit related to a partial tax settlement with the IRS. And if you exclude that, EPS grew 7% for the quarter. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. From a geographic perspective, developed markets remained healthy, and we saw strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. Businesses continue to make long-term investments in the Microsoft platform, and as a result, multi-year licensing, as a percentage of our total revenue, grew to approximately 40%. This quarter, we saw strong Enterprise Agreement growth in both new business and renewals. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.2 billion, up 17%, and our contracted not billed balance was over $19 billion. Moving on to the PC market. We estimate the worldwide PC market grew 2% to 4% this quarter. Business PCs grew 8% as businesses continued to upgrade their hardware and software to Windows 7. When excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 6%. We are pleased with the early demand for Ultrabooks as they reinvigorate personal computing with innovative design, high performance and enhanced battery life. Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 4%. As in past quarters, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, Windows revenues slightly outgrew the underlying PC market due to the strength of the business refresh and attach gains in several geographic regions. In late February, we made the Windows 8 Consumer Preview available. It is important to note that the development of Windows 8 on both Intel and ARM is proceeding on our schedule. Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 9%. Consumer revenue increased 2%, while business transactional revenue grew 5%, again, outperforming our historical trends. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 13% as customers continued their commitment to our productivity services. As businesses embrace social enterprise scenarios, they are turning to the combined power of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync to enable their presence, collaboration and communication needs. This quarter, Exchange and SharePoint both grew double digits, while Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 35%. During the quarter, we launched the technical preview of the next version of Office, codenamed Office 15, with public beta coming later this summer. Our Dynamics business continued its momentum and revenue grew double-digits. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30% with more than 2.25 million users and 33,000 customers who leverage Dynamics CRM every day. Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted another solid quarter with 14% revenue growth and over 20% bookings growth. Transactional revenue grew low single-digits, roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market growth. Multi-year licensing revenue was up high teens, and Enterprise Services once again grew more than 20%. Our growth and market success this quarter demonstrates that our customers really value our unique ability to deliver a solution which spans the private and public cloud. In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew more than 20%. We launched the beta version of Windows Server 2012 and announced the general availability of System Center 2012, which will help customers progress beyond virtualization to build efficient and secure hybrid cloud. In the public cloud, we recently announced strategic partnerships with leading service providers, Accenture and Hitachi, to offer enterprise-ready cloud solutions on our Windows Azure platform to accelerate application deployment and migration. We are the only company which can deliver a common identity, virtualization, management and development platform to our customers across both private and public clouds. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew high teens while SQL premium revenue grew more than 30% as customers increasingly selected the premium edition to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workload needs. In early April, we announced general availability of SQL Server 2012, which now enables businesses to scale on-demand and create flexible hybrid deployment. Hundreds of global industry-leading customers such as Mitsui, Volvo, Revlon and LG Chemical have already deployed SQL Server 2012 for production use to leverage its enhanced performance, reliability and high-availability features. We also recently announced the second preview of Hadoop-based services with customers such as Webtrends using it to glean simple, actionable insights from complex data sets hosted in the cloud. Hadoop integration, along with the powerful analytic capabilities in SQL Server 2012, position us well to capture the full potential of big data growth. With major releases in each of our server product offerings, we continue to strengthen our enterprise portfolio and empower businesses to be both more agile and efficient. Moving on to the Online Services Division, revenue grew 6% and operating performance improved by $300 million. This quarter, online advertising revenue was up 9%, driven by volume and rate improvements in our Search business. In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 16%, reflecting the soft gaming console market. Xbox maintained its share leadership in the U.S. this quarter, and we continue to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE with the release of 3 new major entertainment applications: Comcast XFINITY TV, HBO GO and MLB.TV, all with Kinect integration. We are working to bring Windows Phone to more people. Our progress can be seen with the April launch of 4G LTE phone through AT&T, our launch in China with multiple OEMs and the enabling of sub-$200 phones with more silicon support. With this work and with the building enthusiasm around Windows Phones, we have seen the number of apps published in the marketplace increase by 50% over the past 3 months. Turning to Skype, we continue to be pleased with both the pace of the integration and the rapid growth of the business. This quarter, Skype users made over 100 billion minutes of calls over the Skype network, an increase of 40% from the prior year. I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, reflecting changes in the mix of products and services sold. Operating expenses were $7.1 billion, an increase of 4%, mainly due to higher people costs. Operating income increased 12% to $6.4 billion.  And this quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. To summarize, we saw strong enterprise uptake for our server and Office products and continued business demand for PCs, leading to healthy top line growth. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to drive margin expansion with our strong focus on cost management. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high-level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2013. Let me start with the fourth quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs and growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets. In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. Within Server & Tools, approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multi-year licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the server hardware market, and multi-year licensing and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow high teens. In the Online Services Division, we will continue to focus on RPS improvements, as well as operating efficiencies. For our Entertainment & Devices Division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits. We expect COGS to grow 8% to 12% for the fourth quarter. As has been the case in the prior quarters, the mix of revenues will continue to impact this number. We are revising our operating expense guidance downward to $28.3 billion to $28.7 billion for fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal 2013, which will include an unprecedented refresh of our major products. With Windows 8 and its availability on both x86 and ARM, we believe the ecosystem will capitalize on the new range of capabilities and scenarios Windows 8 enable. In the enterprise, the addition of Windows Server 2012, combined with the momentum of SQL Server and System Center, position us to take share as businesses increasingly look to cloud-optimize their IT infrastructure. And in productivity, we believe Office 15 will help people work, collaborate and communicate smarter and faster than before, driving growth in the Office business. Consumers will see ongoing innovation in Xbox, Skype, Windows Phone and Bing. So as you can see, there is a lot to look forward to next year. We expect fiscal 2013 operating expenses to be $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion, which represents growth of 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2012 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses against the backdrop of a big product release year. In closing, our product portfolio is stronger than it has ever been, and customer satisfaction with our products and services is high. And with our latest wave of innovation, paired with the ongoing operating expense discipline, we are well positioned to continue delivering value to shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part question. Operator, can you please go ahead and repeat your instruction?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt of Morgan Stanley.\nAdam H. Holt: My question is about the enterprise upgrade cycle. The clock is ticking on XP obviously, but you're only at 40% of the enterprises upgraded. Where do you think that number goes? Do you think it's front-end loaded towards calendar '12 versus calendar '13? And how do you think about how that impacts the model given some recovery with ELAs?\nPeter S. Klein: Well, the only thing I could say, Adam, is obviously, it's high on the priority list for CIOs to upgrade their business desktop. And we've seen that. We've seen that in deployments as we talked about, and it remains a high priority. Exactly how that will play out over the next couple of years is hard to say. The momentum's been great so far. It remains a top priority, so we see that momentum continuing really over the next couple years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I was just wondering, Peter, a few years ago, and you might not have been CFO at the time, you guys had talked about online and what your goals were 5 years out, and talking about 20% organic market share and that could get you to breakeven. I mean, given what we're seeing in terms of RPS, although you're doing a very good job on the OpEx side, how would you say you're thinking about that today?\nPeter S. Klein: Well, thanks, Heather. The same basic dynamics continue, right? We need to do 2 things: we need to grow our share, we need to grow our RPS. So really improve our monetization. At the same time, it's managing the operating performance, which we've been doing. So the same characteristics apply. We are making progress on both counts, as Bill indicated. We saw gains in both volume and rate, and we need to continue to do that sort of monotonically sort of quarter after quarter and year after year.\nBill Koefoed: Yes, I would just add on to that, and I've been reminding some investors to go back and watch the FAM presentation that Qi Lu gave back in September. We do view our Search asset as a pretty strategic asset for the company. The capabilities that it offers are leveraged across our -- we think can be leveraged across our whole product set. So I do think our strategy has evolved from whatever conversation you had a couple, 3 years ago because we see the opportunity to leverage the asset being even more powerful than maybe we did at that point. But a good reminder if people haven't looked at that video, you can go back and look at it on the site.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.\nRichard G. Sherlund: On EDD, just sort of curious whether there's anticipation. We're not really looking for much at E3 this year. I think new console, people are thinking is maybe next year. There is Halo 4 coming. Just how are you thinking about, with more and more gaming going to mobile, what do you think the outlook is beyond next quarter for EDD? Or do we need a new console cycle to create growth in that segment?\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Rick. We feel really good about both our sort of market position and our strategy. If you think about what we've done over the last couple of years, we've really staked out a unique value proposition and a unique strategy when it comes to not just the gaming console but also the UI technology with Kinect, and importantly, our Xbox LIVE and all the entertainment content that comes with that, which we view as a persistent long-term revenue stream, both from a subscriber perspective as well as a transactional perspective. And so we feel great about our leadership position. We've been the #1 console for the last 15 months or so. We feel great about our unique value proposition and the growing business we have with both Kinect and LIVE, and we think that's really persistent. If you look at the engagement that our subscribers have, the amount of time they spend doing entertainment as opposed to gaming is increasing all the time. And so I think the strategy and the value proposition there plays out very well over the next several years.\nRichard G. Sherlund: And will Skype be a big benefit to that division going forward?\nPeter S. Klein: Skype will be a big benefit across the company as we've talked about how it plays across all of our businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Peter, you guys had a much better enterprise performance than I think most of the peers that we've seen report that are enterprise-exposed, IBM, et cetera. And I'm wondering if you could help us out with understanding where you saw strength across your business there. Was it more small business, medium business enterprise? Was there any trends there that might help us understand why you're outperforming some of your peers?\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Walter. Yes, it was all segments, but I would highlight the enterprise, and it's really broad-based. I mean, businesses are investing in data centers. They're investing in their desktops because they see technology as a way to really both cut costs and improve their strategic positioning. For a while, CIOs have been saying Microsoft is a top priority, and we're really, really starting to see that both on the infrastructure side and the desktop side. We feel great about our product lineup, particularly in Server & Tools. If you think of what we've done with System Center and SQL Server and the upcoming release of Windows Server 2012, we kind of have a unique value proposition for enterprises, which is all about the hybrid private and public cloud which nobody else really has. And we've seen growth across both of those things. Similarly on the Business division side, we've broadened the Office business in several important ways over the last several years. One is in the experiences and workloads that people are getting in communications and collaboration, and that's been a huge growth driver. And secondly, again, it's cloud services and how that expands from helping people understand our roadmap from where they are today to how to get to the public cloud. I think those things taken together across-the-board have allowed us to take share and allowed us to grow both of those business, and you're really starting to see that take hold. And we're really excited about the product lineup that's coming in the next 6 to 9 months.\nBill Koefoed: Yes, I'd just add on to that, that I think that -- I think investors sometimes put companies in a box and say, \"You're either in private cloud or you're in public cloud. \" And as Peter mentioned, we're in both. I mean, we have high growth rates in both and we are, as Peter said, really the only company that's got that breadth of offerings and the growth rate on both the private, the public and then importantly, we've kind of coined this term, of hybrid IT where you can have a roadmap as you kind of want to use both to manage your IT infrastructure. So yes, we feel really good about where we are and the share that we're taking in the marketplace for sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS.\nBrent Thill: You commented that you saw strong multiyear licensing, and I was just curious if you could just talk about how the upcoming cycle is helping influence that. And if I caught this right, Bill, I think you mentioned new enterprise agreements. You also saw strength there. So if could you talk through the dynamics of what you're seeing on these multiyear deals.\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, the way that the product pipeline impacts our multiyear licensing business is enterprises are, when they invest in a multiyear licensing agreement, they're invest -- they're making a long-term investment in their platforms, in their infrastructure and they're making a long-term investment in their vendors. And so it's important to really understand the roadmap. And that's where the pipeline really helps, and that's really been, I think, a big driver so far. And that applies not only to the workloads and the capabilities and the products themselves, but as Bill just mentioned, the private and public cloud roadmap because people really are starting to think about long term, how do they make that transition from where they are today in their data centers to a public cloud world. So having that roadmap and having that pipeline really impacts our current period Enterprise business, and I think that's what you saw, not only in Server & Tools but also in the Business division as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.\nMark L. Moerdler: So you've seen -- we saw strong numbers in System Center growing well as well as SQL Server, and yet we're just about to enter a product cycle. Normally, I guess they would slow down a bit. What do you think is the driver of why this has continued to accelerate into the cycle?\nPeter S. Klein: I'll just go back to our continued vision, our continued roadmap, the capabilities that we're offering. I mean, it's a combination of the features and capabilities particularly in System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012. And SQL Server 2012 is an amazing value proposition when you think about its scalability, when you think about business intelligence and analytics and when you think about the roadmap to the public cloud. People are understanding not only current features in the product, but they are looking towards the future roadmap. And I think that's what's really, really driving that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: I just got another question on the Server & Tools division. Obviously, Intel is coming out with a new chip, Romley here, probably shipping to OEMs now, probably see it actually being delivered in servers late Q2, Q3 in the calendar. How do you think that these chip cycles actually are going to impact your business?\nPeter S. Klein: Super excited about it, but I think about the business more broadly obviously, customers making long-term investments in their roadmap. We love what they're doing. We think that's an interesting thing. And to the extent the ecosystem technology evolves, that's always a good thing for how businesses are investing in their infrastructure. But I wouldn't want to overstate it as a much broader issue in terms of the long-term roadmap. But certainly having advances in technology, whether it's in hardware or in the data center, is a great thing, I'll allow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.\nJohn S. DiFucci: Peter and then Bill, I think the Windows numbers were a little stale out there as far as consensus numbers. But even when you adjust for the more recent PC unit shipment data and something in line with what you guys said, I think PC, I think Gartner and IDC were at least in the neighborhood there. Maybe when you make those adjustments, the Windows business was even stronger than what we would have expected anyway. And I guess I'm just trying to try to get a little more color on that or figure that out. I guess a question maybe on the OEM revenue bridge, you got plus 2% from attach and inventory. Bill, I think you said that business refresh in attach was strong in some regions. But I think -- I would think anyway that given that PC shipments are much stronger in emerging markets, even if some emerging markets were a little bit better than normal, you'd still wouldn't necessarily get an aggregate attach that would be stronger. So I guess the question is, was there a meaningful move in inventory, OEM inventory that helped a bit this quarter? Because those numbers are stronger than they I would've thought.\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks. I know -- it's actually a couple things. One, yes, on emerging markets. The business PC is what really drove the Windows business. And so if you think about the Windows revenue growth being really on the high end of our estimated PC shipment range, it's really a function of: one, business PC is really doing well relative to consumers. And again, that's consistent with the theme we've seen on businesses investing in their technology. And in addition to that, we had -- we did see some attach gains. I mean, and that's just reductions in piracy kind of broadly, not in any one place. That was a tailwind this quarter. As you know, sometimes that's not always a tailwind. In general, in the long term, that tends to be on the uptick. But this quarter, that attach and inventory gain is really partially attach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.\nKash G. Rangan: I don't have any questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Gillis of BGC Financial.\nColin Gillis: Can you just update us on the changes and the refresh in the marketing group? Where the priorities are for the spend? And any major upcoming campaigns?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, the marketing organization continues on. We are always making sort of tweaks and changes and making sure we're being as efficient and effective as possible and getting all the resources where we want them. If you think more broadly about our marketing focus as a company, clearly heading into this launch wave of our major core products like Windows, like Office, like Windows Server, you can imagine we're going to be focusing most of our marketing talent and most of our attention on those areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Peter, should we assume that we're going to see the same Windows upgrade rights around Windows 8 that we've seen around prior releases? And therefore, should we be expecting to see some big swings in Windows revenue at some point in the middle of next year because -- or at some point during next year because of the deferrals like we've seen in the past?\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Brendan. Obviously, we're super excited about the launch of Windows 8, and we're heads down trying to get that released. We haven't said anything and will not today, but we'll have more to talk about in terms of programs and promotions as we get closer to the launch date.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division When you look through the pretty extensive product refreshes you have across the portfolio, are you thinking that there may be the possibility that customers may pause in any of your products? And as you look at seasonality, is there a likelihood that we might see a bit more pronounced seasonality leading up into some of the big launches?\nPeter S. Klein: I think generally, particularly in the enterprise, you don't really see a seasonality impact. If you think about how large enterprises plan their information technology spend, they sort of have a long-term roadmap. They're on it. They execute against it when they do. Obviously, our long-term roadmap, as I've said, impacts that. And so it's more about their long-term planning cycles than it is about sort of any product cycle, particularly in the enterprise, which is where a lot of the growth is coming from and a lot of the products are coming for.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: I was having a forward-looking question on the gross margin. Remember in the last few quarters where you had a slight negative mix effect there. As I look into the new product launches into the next year, is there anything -- they're all kind of high gross margin areas. Is there anything that stops that feeding through in the P&L? Or should it be a straightforward one?\nPeter S. Klein: You're correct, mix is what drives the gross margin percentage and obviously we saw that this quarter. And so you're right in the math of that. If there's good growth, better growth in higher-margin products, that will have a positive impact on gross margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.\nGregg Moskowitz: This past quarter, both Gartner and IDC saw a better-than-expected PC uptick in the European corporate market. And your reported Windows revenues certainly support that. I know broadly speaking the business refresh was healthy. Just was wondering if there's anything you would add that might have contributed to an uptick in Europe PC growth.\nPeter S. Klein: Nothing specific to add to that. We did -- as we talked about, we saw broad-based growth geographically in business in particular, and so there's nothing sort of unusual or specific in Europe about that.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.\nJason Maynard: I had a question on this fiscal '13 OpEx guidance, which is a couple points, looks like if you use the midpoint, ahead of the fiscal '12 growth rate. And I'm just curious, the delta, obviously, I would assume would come to some of the product launches. But the question broader is do you think you have enough spend baked into that model to account for the big push you're going to need to make around perhaps on the smartphone side, given that, that's an area where you're coming from behind, given all the other products that you're going to be releasing and obviously consumer push in some of the new enterprise products?\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Jason. Obviously, over the last several years and even longer, we've really been focused on making sure we're prioritizing our spend to the highest value areas, so you asked a good question. And our approach is exactly the same. Like we've done the last couple of years, we're really looking at next year and saying, \"How can we most effectively and most efficiently allocate the resources to the areas that drive the best long-term results?\" And we think we've got a good balance there as we've had in the past. We've tried to be transparent and consistent in that, really predictably execute against that. And I think what we've got next year is a good balance between the exciting launches that we have that really drive both short- and long-term growth, as well as hopefully a good financial result.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Despite a challenging PC market, we delivered solid financial results. We saw a strong demand for our business products and services and had a record holiday season, driven by the unique entertainment experience we have built with Xbox 360. This quarter, the strength of our product portfolio enabled us to grow revenue 5% to $20.9 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for a big launch year, we delivered record earnings per share of $0.78. Similar to prior periods, we saw a broad-based growth across geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division had another good quarter as businesses and consumers around the world look to Microsoft to meet their productivity needs. Six quarters post-launch, Office 2010 continues to exceed our expectation, with increased consumer and business PC Attach worldwide. We saw double-digit revenue growth across our key business application workloads, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics CRM and ERP. As businesses large and small look to the cloud to lower costs and enable new ways of supporting a distributed workforce, they are turning to Microsoft. With Office 365, we give customers powerful productivity and collaboration tools at great value. Today, more than 100,000 businesses have made the commitment to our Online Services. Whether on-premise or in the cloud, Microsoft remains the top choice for productivity. The Server & Tools Business delivered another strong quarter, as we continue to execute on our strategy of cloud optimizing every business. CIOs are increasingly turning to our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center as they look to Microsoft for the security, flexibility and manageability they need to build world-class private clouds. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Windows Server Premium revenue and the 11th quarter of double-digit revenue growth for System Center. On the data platform, we remain the worldwide unit share leader with SQL Server. Consistent with our strategy, we are growing our revenue share with marquee customer wins on mission-critical workloads and business intelligence capabilities. This year, we will bring to market the next generation of our server offerings, including Windows Server 8, SQL Server 2012 and System Center 2012, which deepen and broaden our platform for the private cloud. Combined with the power of Windows Azure for the public cloud, our offerings give enterprises the identity, virtualization, application development and management tools they need to efficiently progress into the new era of hybrid IT. The PC market was challenged this quarter, with particular softness in the consumer segment. However, Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continued and today, over 1/3 of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7. And with the future release of Windows 8, we believe the ecosystem will benefit from the new range of capabilities and scenarios that it enables. In Search, we saw improvements in RPS this quarter as we partnered closely with Yahoo! to address the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are pleased with the progress and are working hard to continue that trajectory. In the years since Windows Phone launch, we have worked diligently alongside our partners, including Nokia, to bring a differentiated experience to the mobile platform. Earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show, we showcased the latest innovation in Windows Phone to very positive reviews. With these new devices, we are increasing the choices for consumers around the world to find a Windows Phone that is exactly right for them. As I mentioned, Xbox 360 had a record holiday season as we continue to differentiate home entertainment. Whether it's using Bing Voice Search on Xbox to quickly find the movies and shows you want to watch or enabling more interactive TV as we demonstrated at CES with Sesame Street and Elmo, Xbox and Kinect are bringing together our technologies to redefine the living room experience. Beyond gaming and entertainment, with the Kinect for Windows program which launches February 1, our technology will further innovation and creativity across industries. During the quarter, we started the integration of Skype's world-class communication products and global network platform into our portfolio of products and services. While it is still early, we are excited by the momentum we have seen thus far and by the opportunities to redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world. As I have consistently mentioned, operating expense management is a priority for Microsoft. Reflecting our ongoing discipline and prioritization of investments, operating expenses grew just 4% this quarter. In summary, we delivered solid financial results despite a challenging PC market. The strength of our product portfolio drove solid top line growth, we delivered record earnings per share and we are well positioned for future growth. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was a record $20.9 billion, up 5% or $900 million year-over-year. Operating income was $8 billion, cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and earnings per share was $0.78. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. Enterprise demand remains strong as our customers continue to add both product and seats to their Enterprise Agreement, and our renewal rates remain solid. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.3 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was approximately $19 billion. Turning to the PC market, as I mentioned last week, it was a challenging quarter for the industry. Factors such as the flooding in Thailand, macroeconomic uncertainty and competing form factors resulted in an overall market that we estimate declined 2% to 4%. In the PC market, it appears that the impact of the hard drive supply chain constraints were not limited to a specific region or OEM type. While absolute volumes were impacted, we did see the following trends continue: PC sales to emerging markets outpaced developed markets; the business PC refresh cycle continued with business PC growth of 2%; the decline of netbooks negatively impacted consumer PCs which were down 6%. Netbooks, which a year ago represented about 8% of the PC market, now represents only 2%. Excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 2%. Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was down 6%. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The primary differences between the PC market and Windows revenue were the continuing growth of emerging markets faster than developed markets and inventory drawdown from the prior quarter. We have now sold 525 million Windows 7 licenses since launch. And as Peter mentioned, we are seeing sustained momentum on enterprise deployments. In December, we announced that Windows 8 beta would be available in late February, and we also previewed the Windows Store, which will be the hub where users can discover and download applications. For developers, the Windows Store represents a significant opportunity given its broad reach, flexibility and favorable economic terms. Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Recall in Q2 last year that we recognized $224 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee Program. And if you exclude that, revenue grew 7% for the quarter. Consumer revenue declined 17% year-over-year and declined 2% when factoring in the impact of the Technology Guarantee Program that I just mentioned. The outperformance relative to the overall PC market was driven by Attach games, which continued despite being 18 months since the launch of Office 2010. Business revenue grew 9%. And within Business, multiyear licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 3%, driven by strong Attach worldwide. We continue to see strong growth in our productivity solution offerings. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange each grew double digits. We've previously shared with you the opportunity that we see for unified communications, and we are beginning to realize that potential. Lync revenue grew over 30% as customers such as Volkswagen and LA Fitness chose Microsoft to be their voice and video solution. This quarter, Office 365 became this first major cloud provider to comply with leading EU and U.S. standards for data protection. Meeting these high standards enables businesses to more fully realize the potential of the cloud. We also had our first major service enhancement to Office 365, which extends the company's next-generation cloud productivity service to reach businesses in 22 additional markets. During the quarter, companies such as JetBlue, Campbell Soup, Patagonia and Wunderman chose Office 365 to enable their employees and customers to work together in the cloud. We are also pleased with the momentum and cloud services for education, where we now have more than 22 million users, a 100% increase over the prior year. Our Dynamics business continued its momentum, where revenue grew double digits both in CRM and ERP. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. Dynamics CRM had important competitive wins this quarter against Salesforce.com and Oracle, such as Safety-Kleen Systems and the American Heart Association. The common theme among switchers was that Dynamics CRM has a familiar user interface, which improves productivity while delivering lower operating costs than the competition. Now let's move on to Server & Tools where revenue grew 11%, driven by multiyear license revenue that was up mid-teens in Enterprise Services. We saw broad-based strength across our products. In our data platform business, SQL Server grew low double-digits, outpacing industry growth due to the strength of our premium edition. This quarter, we saw competitive database wins against Oracle such as U.K.-based retailer, The Co-operative Group, which switched to SQL Server because of its advantages in business intelligence, security, flexibility and cost. We also saw a strong market anticipation for SQL Server 2012 with over 100,000 downloads in the 2 months since the release candidate was made available. In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew over 20%. On Tuesday, we announced System Center 2012 which brings many of our Azure cloud capabilities to an integrated private cloud management solution for the first time. We also announced great competitive wins against VMware with accounts such as T. Rowe Price, Unilever and Lufthansa Systems. System Center 2012 integrates each separate component products into one unified solution, streamlining installation and reducing the time it takes to deploy from days down to hours. Additionally, we've provided a clear path to Windows Azure for customers who are looking for a public or hybrid cloud solution. In the public cloud, our December release of Azure enhanced ease-of-use and simplified deployment, as well as delivered new open source capabilities with Hadoop support. We are seeing strong growth in the number of large customers signing up to use Azure. One such example is Sony Pixar's Crackle online content service, which has moved to Azure due to the cost savings, agility and performance it provides. Now I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 10% and operating performance improved for the second consecutive quarter. Online advertising revenue was up 13%, driven primarily by Search. The increase in Search revenue was driven by both rate and volume improvement. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.1%, up 40 basis points this quarter and over 300 basis points year-over-year. Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division, where revenue grew 15%. According to a third-party research, Xbox was the #1 console in the U.S. during calendar year 2011 and had 46% of U.S. console sales in December. During the quarter, we sold 8.2 million consoles, which was up over 25% despite a soft gaming console market. Kinect continues to impress customers with 18 million Kinects having been sold since launch just over 1 year ago. Xbox LIVE members grew 33%, with 40 million users now enjoying Xbox LIVE. In December, Xbox released the new Metro style dashboard and added dozens of new entertainment applications and content partners to the platform. While it is early, engagement has been quite impressive as the number of people using entertainment apps from November to December increased by almost 50%. We continue to make progress with Windows Phone. During the quarter, Nokia began to bring some of their great new devices to market, which adds to the growing list of compelling phones available from our OEM partners. At CES, the talk of the show was the new LTE Windows Phones from Nokia and HTC that will be available on AT&T in the coming months, joining the Lumia 710, which is now available on T-Mobile. In October, Skype officially joined Microsoft. This quarter, over 200 million people used Skype to communicate with family, friends and businesses. For calendar year 2011, over 300 billion minutes of calls were made over the Skype network, an increase of 50%. The teams are working closely on the integration across Microsoft, and we will share more as we get further along the road map. Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 17%, driven by the following: first, we saw an increase in costs resulting from the strong Xbox console sales and increased Xbox royalties; second, Enterprise Services continue to grow rapidly; and third, Online Services and traffic acquisition costs increased. Operating expenses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4%, driven primarily due to compensation, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. This quarter, we've returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. So in summary, we saw a strong demand from our business customers, and our Xbox platform delivered a record holiday season. We were able to navigate a challenging PC market to deliver solid top line and earnings per share growth. With that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year. Beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to the past several quarters. PC growth in emerging markets will outpace developed markets, and business PC growth will outpace consumer PC growth. We also expect the hard disk drive shortage to continue to challenge the PC market to at least the next quarter. Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. And multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenues comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market, multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double-digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow high teens. Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business and are looking for ways to increase RPS and streamline costs. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue to show year-over-year improvements in RPS. Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division. We continue to be very pleased with our share of the worldwide console market. However, the console market is softer than we previously expected, and as a result, we now expect revenue to grow high single-digits for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen the past few quarters. We expect COGS to grow about 8% to 10% for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. As a result of our focus on operating expense management, we are lowering our fiscal year guidance. We now expect operating expenses to be $28.5 billion to $28.9 billion for the full fiscal year, including the impact of Skype. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the third quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year. For the third quarter, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double-digits compared to the prior fiscal year. As we look forward, we have the strongest product pipeline we have ever had. We're pleased with the early enthusiasm around our upcoming wave of products that enable CIOs to cloud optimize their business. And we are excited by the opportunity to unify the consumer experience across our phones, PCs, tablets and TVs with our new Metro style design. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill and we'll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt.\nAdam H. Holt: My question is about the material improvement in OSD margins quarter-on-quarter. It looks like you held firm on expenses year-on-year. Does that reflect the new philosophy around that business in terms of driving profitability? And can you update us on where you think you are on the RPS improvement?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes. As we've been saying, the key to profitability in that business is to grow our top line because it scales really well. The marginal impact of that is very high because it's a high fixed cost business. We have been, as we've been growing share and improving our RPS especially this quarter, holding the line on operating expenses and really streamlining. The most important thing long term, as we\u2019ve said, is to continue to grow that share and grow the revenue per search, so we're pleased with that trajectory and want to keep on that. And we are watching the cost very carefully so that, that revenue marginally goes to the bottom line. And that's what you saw happen this quarter, and that's the trajectory we hope to stay on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.\nWalter H. Pritchard: We're just wondering on the EDD side. It looks like you called out the Nokia payments as part of COGS as a driver. And I'm wondering, you've been pointing us to mix of revenue types as mainly the driver there of COGS. Could you help us out with how meaningful those payments were? And how should we expect those to continue to track as we move into future quarters?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, it's part of it. There were several things impacting the gross margins in the E&D business. Obviously, one is just the volume of consoles and the mix of consoles, high end versus low end, the mix of software whether it's first party or third party that has a different margin characteristic. And so that's the biggest piece in E&D. Then the Nokia piece is also another piece that plays into that. But the biggest piece is the mix of business in the E&D business and then Nokia is also another driver of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.\nRichard G. Sherlund: On the hard drive shortage issue, I spoke with Gartner on Monday, and they were looking for PCs of down 1%. You guys have said down 2% to 4%, and they helped reconcile that, suggesting that there were some issues in terms of the pipeline of products. And if the inventories were reduced in the pipeline, that might reconcile why the 2 of you are viewing the industry somewhat differently. I'm just curious if you think that's going to continue into the next quarter. I know we're going to see an impact in this next quarter. I'm just curious whether you and Gartner might be more in line with each other going forward? Or if there's more inventory reduction in that pipeline that might be an ongoing impact above and beyond perhaps what we're seeing from the numbers that Gartner and IDC are giving us?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, that's impossible to say, Rick. I'd say obviously, for this quarter, we obviously are very confident and comfortable with the estimate as we said during the remarks. We expect the impact to continue on at least to the next quarter. And I think the best thing to do is at the end of that, we'll probably all have a better view and we kind of assess where we are and what it looks like going forward. I'd say just generally on the inventory as well, obviously, as I've said in my remarks, there was an inventory drawdown to end the quarter. I think there was an overall -- I think both IDC and Gartner have also talked about the fact that the overall supply chain for PCs is obviously leaner than it was 3 months ago. So we'll have to see how fast kind of people ramp back up, how fast the PC ecosystem rebounds, and that will obviously impact, as Peter mentioned, inventory at the end of the quarter as well. So good question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I was wondering, Peter, if you could talk a little bit about which businesses are the furthest along regarding their COGS transition as you move more and more of your revenues to the cloud, if you could kind of rank order them for us?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, I'd say Office 365 is really far along. We've had a lot of good momentum and obviously, one of the things that drive -- you up the sort of margin scale -- is getting the economy to scale with volume, and we talked about some of the numbers, the 100,000 businesses the great sort of demand we've had for sort of the Office business all up including Office 365. So I'd say that's probably farthest along, followed closely by Windows Azure as we sort of add new enterprise customers, new ISVs, new developers to that. But certainly, Office 365 is accelerating at the ramp.\nBill Koefoed: And the other thing that I would add is obviously OSD is, we'll call it, kind of our largest cloud property. And as Peter mentioned earlier, I think in one of the questions, it obviously has achieved scale. And as a result, kind of every incremental kind of search ends up becoming 100% margin. So we are -- we're at different stages, I think, within some of the different business products. But certainly around running a cloud infrastructure, we feel like we've got quite good handle on that from -- primarily from our Search business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMC.\nJohn S. DiFucci: My question essentially follows to Rick. It has to do with the Windows OEM revenue bridge. Just curious on some of these items, how they fit today. For instance, and I believe, Bill and Peter, you take account for that inventory changes in the Windows Attach and inventory line. And last quarter, it added about 5% to the quarter. This quarter, it was a 2% hit. And Bill, you noted the inventory drawdown had an effect there. Can you give us a sense on where you think channel inventories are today relative to what you might call normal levels? And then also just quickly on that last line in that bridge, the OEM revenue adjustment, when is this stop -- going to stop being negative? It's been slightly negative for quite some time now. And shouldn't it have stopped like 3 years after the Vista launch because it -- wasn't it related to XP and having Internet Explorer as part of that as a meaningful part of that versus for Vista?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, we'll take the second one first. Next year, that should go away. So to answer your question, yes, that's what you would expect and that's what will happen. On your first question on inventory, at any given quarter, inventory is going to be -- sort of go up and down depending on what's going on in the channel. As you noted, sometimes, it's a tailwind, sometimes it's a headwind like it was this quarter. It's hard to say precisely what sort of -- where it stands and what it's going to be like next quarter. We'll sort of look at it when we get there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from San Bernstein.\nMark L. Moerdler: Question for you. How much of the year-over-year decrease in the consumer revenue on the Offices product is due to licensing, licenses specifically included in OEM sales of PCs as compared to stand-alone Office sales to the consumer market?\nPeter S. Klein: It's mostly associated with OEM. I mean, the driver that we use for that part of the MBD business is specifically tied with the PC unit growth of consumers. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, we actually outperformed that but that's the best driver that -- it's not complete but that's the best driver of trying to be able to predict or interpret that result.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Just got a question on just the Windows division. When you think about the impact of Windows 8 coming out theoretically, obviously, the second half of this year, how do you think that's going to impact build plans amongst the OEMs but also inventory levels when we get to the summer?\nPeter S. Klein: Probably pretty premature to talk about that. I think we need to get closer to it. So the thing I would say is just from an ecosystem perspective, there's an incredible amount of excitement and innovation going on across vendors like the chip vendors and all the OEMs. You actually see that starting today with the Ultrabooks that you're seeing with Windows 7. And so the fact of the matter is there's a ton of innovation happening today for Windows 7. There's a ton of excitement for enterprises for both Windows 7 and looking forward to Windows 8, and what that gives them in terms of an end user experience and IT manageability. So I don't think about it so much as looking forward. There's a ton of innovation going on today. You see it in Ultrabooks. You see it in what both the ARM and x86 chip vendors are doing, and so that sort of continues sort of on a regular pace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.\nKash G. Rangan: If you look at the last few quarters, I know we've been through tough comps, sluggish slower revenue growth rate and also the mix issues that have caused the margins, the gross margins to go down. As you come out of this tough cycle and start to get into this, the next sort of launches, should we think about the gross margins as starting to go in the other direction just based on the -- what looks to be better mix between your Windows -- just typical software businesses as you get into launch year? Part of me it says maybe the margins are bottoming here. Of course, I completely respect the fact that you've got sort of another mix issues that are more longer term as you have Entertainment & Devices business, the cost there, et cetera. But shouldn't margins start to go back up as you head into launch year?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes. Certainly, margins are a function of mix. And to the extent there\u2019s a higher mix and higher margin products, that will have a positive impact on margins. And it's not unrealistic to think that in a launch year, you can see a higher growth in higher-margin products. So it will depend on what the mix is, but I think it's a very plausible scenario.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: I was wondering if you could give us any color on what you saw geographically in terms of growth trends in particular or any -- in particular in Europe or Asia, it was weak or strong?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes. We saw a particular strength in emerging markets, particularly what we call the BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China. That was really a driver of growth for us. And that's exciting for us because we've had got strong and growing positions there, and that's where kind of disproportionate economic growth is happening sort of worldwide. But as Bill mentioned and as I mentioned, we saw a broad-based strength in demand across geographies but with particular strength in emerging markets.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division You called out 100,000 businesses that are engaged in Online Services. Could you comment on the impact that this transition is having on recognized revenues versus unearned and contracted not billed?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, it's interesting. Subscription businesses aren't that much different from our existing multiyear licensing business in the sense that it sort of bills upfront and then recognized over time, just like our multiyear licensing agreements. And so it really doesn't have a significant impact on the sort of flavor or character of our revenue recognition or unearned revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Great. Peter, the business PC growth rate was down about 300 basis points sequentially. Was that all economic or hard disk drive?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes. I'd say -- the one thing I'd say is the overall business environment sort of remains very strong for us. And so sort of all of our sort of macro indicators for business spending on IT remain good, unearned revenue, our renewals for enterprise licensing agreements and sort of enterprise deployments of Windows 7. In terms of PCs, as we said, there's still growth and we're still in the refresh cycle. I do suspect that some of that, well, is due to supply chain and maybe a small amount due to macro but it's small.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.\nGregg Moskowitz: Peter, you mentioned Ultrabooks earlier, and on the heels of CES, we're going to be seeing a lot more of them hit the market. Can you talk about what this means for Microsoft? And more importantly, when might Ultrabooks be ready for the mass market from a cost perspective?\nPeter S. Klein: What it means -- for me, what it represents is sort of the excitement and the opportunity long term in building compelling devices for consumers and businesses around the world. There's so much innovation still to get done. There's so many new form factors, so many new use cases. And I think it's great to see what the ecosystem does when it works together, as I mentioned before. In terms of the sort of price points in mass market, we'll just sort of wait and see how that evolves before commenting on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Klasell of Stifel, Nicolaus.\nTim Klasell: Just a question on the EDD. You have mentioned about a softening in the console sales. Do you think that, that's due to mix shifting towards lower-priced units, or is that business just getting more seasonal? If we model that going forward, should we make that a more seasonal holiday type of an event than we currently do?\nPeter S. Klein: In terms of the over -- first of all, yes, we feel -- for our console business, we feel really good about our sort of relative position in the market and our ability to take share and have a really strong competitive position. In terms of the seasonality, I don't think there's anything that indicates it's sort of more or less seasonal than we've seen in the past. Like many consumer businesses like this, it will always be relatively stronger at the holiday season. And in terms of some of the mixes, some of it's a function of product cycle. If you think about that Kinect centers and how we sold those into our installed base, and now we're selling more bundles, those kinds of things. Its seasonality hasn't marginally -- hasn't materially shifted.\nBill Koefoed: Obviously, when big-title games come out, that tends to also drive kind of a big cycle so that\u2019s also something to pay attention to around this business.\nOperator: Okay, our next question comes from Robert Breza of RBC Capital Markets.\nRobert P. Breza: Bill, maybe could you just comment a little bit back on, I think it was a Cr\u00e9dit Suisse analysts talking about the Windows 8 release the end of February. Given the complexity you're adding into Windows 8 with mobile, et cetera, making that kind of a cross-platform experience, do you expect that to kind of delay the traditional milestones? Or how should we think about Windows 8 going forward?\nBill Koefoed: Yes, I wouldn't think about kind of traditional milestones. I would say one of the things that Tammy [ph] talked about at CES last week was just how important it is for us to work on and with developers to create a really vibrant developer ecosystem. And so one of the things we also talked about with the beta release was the Windows Store, really making sure we're going to have quite a few apps that are going to be up on the Windows Store at beta. Obviously, one of the things she and Steve both talked about last week is that any Windows 7 PC could run Windows 8. But obviously, there\u2019ll be kind of some new and interesting form factors that are going to come out here as we get further on down the road. So I don't know that I would think about it except, as we said earlier, we're on track. We feel really good about where we are on the product, and this next super important milestone is the beta release and having a really great developer ecosystem that kind of surround that. So great question. Okay, so that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we're going to be participating at this quarter. For those of you unable to attend those events in person, you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact me or anyone on my team if you need the additional details.

Today, I\u2019m pleased to share with you our first quarter financial results. We\u2019ve started fiscal year 2012 with good momentum. We have great products in market, customer satisfaction is high, and we have important strategic investments and alliances to position us well for long-term growth. This quarter, we saw revenue growth across all of our segments. Similar to prior periods, we continued to see broad-based demand across geographies, including Europe. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division continued its momentum with revenue of $5.6 billion, growth of 8%. Despite the best efforts of competitors, Office remains the overwhelming choice for productivity, evolving with our customers and posting impressive revenues. We are extremely pleased by the market reception to Office 2010 this far into the launch cycle. We\u2019re 15 months post-launch, but we still saw an increase in the consumer PC attach rate for Office this quarter. And, for businesses, Office 2010 remains a top priority. Just as important, businesses are also adopting our productivity server applications including Lync, SharePoint and Exchange, either on-premise or in the cloud with Office 365. The early success of Office 365 has surpassed our expectations. Businesses around the world, and of all sizes, are making the commitment to Microsoft\u2019s cloud services. Our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center, are a top priority for enterprises. The flexibility, performance, scalability, and price advantage of our private cloud products uniquely meet the needs of the market. And with Windows Azure, we enable our customers to build new applications and extend their existing private cloud assets to the public cloud. As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting, we are increasingly delivering integrated experiences across multiple devices, from the phone to the Xbox and TV and to the PC. Earlier this month, we launched an updated version of our Windows Phone operating system with a broad array of new features and services, including enhanced integration with Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365. With Nokia, Samsung and other devices coming to market, we are well positioned to become the third mobile ecosystem. In the living room, we continue to differentiate the entertainment experience for Xbox users around the world, and we recently announced partnerships with nearly 40 leading TV and entertainment providers. Powered by Kinect and voice search through Bing, users will be able to easily search and enjoy content from a large collection of content providers through their Xbox 360 consoles. And on the PC, Windows 7 is the operating system of choice for almost half a billion people around the world. Combined with the innovative hardware being brought to market by our OEM partners this holiday season, Windows will continue to deliver the great experiences that people want. During the quarter, we unveiled the developer preview of the next version of our PC operating system. Windows 8 creates a modern platform designed for a new generation of hardware experiences enabled by touch and a diversity of chip architectures. In Search, monetization of our ad platform remains below our expectations, and we continue to partner closely with Yahoo! to address the platform gaps and inefficiencies. We recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee payments to Yahoo! reflecting the strength of our partnership and our continued commitment and optimism about the financial opportunity ahead of us. Last week, we reached a significant milestone with the closing of our acquisition of Skype. We welcome Skype employees into the Microsoft family. And we welcome the over 170 million people who rely on Skype for their voice and video calls on a monthly basis. Now that the deal is closed, we are starting the integration of Skype\u2019s world-class services and global-networked platform across our portfolio of products and services including Lync, Windows Live Messenger, Windows Phone and the Xbox platform.  Together, we will redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world. In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. Customer demand across the breadth of our product portfolio was healthy, and we remain focused on our strategic investments and partnerships that will help drive future growth. With that, I\u2019m going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up $1.2 billion or 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $7.2 billion, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.68, an increase of 10%. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income during the quarter. Coming off a record Q4, enterprise demand for our products remained strong, and our customers continued to add both products and seats to their enterprise agreements. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.7 billion, and our contracted not billed remained over $18.5 billion. Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the overall market grew 1% to 3%. Within that, PC sales to emerging markets continued to outpace developed markets. Business PCs grew 5% to a quarterly record of almost 35 million PCs. And consumer PCs were flat, primarily impacted by weakness in netbook sales. Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 2% and grew in line with the PC market. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, the Windows business continued to show momentum. During the quarter, we surpassed 450 million copies of Windows 7 sold since launch, and enterprise deployments of Windows 7 progressed. This quarter, OEM licenses grew 4%, and within that, business licenses grew 6%. While we have seen the cannibalization of netbooks, sales of Windows licenses on traditional consumer PCs showed healthy growth of 14%. As we look towards the holiday season, we are particularly excited about the lineup of impressive Ultrabooks that will be in market from our OEM partners. Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 8%. Consumer revenue increased 7%, despite difficult comps from the year ago launch of Office 2010. The business transactional portion grew 3%, driven by strong attach in developed markets, partially offset by the impact of PC geographical market mix. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew 9%. Collaboration and communication continued to be a pillar of strength to our Office business. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew over 25% as customers increasingly chose Microsoft for their voice and video rollouts. We are focused on the opportunities in this large and growing market. With Skype's highly engaged users spending an average of 125 minutes per month, we're particularly excited about the role Skype can play in connecting individuals and businesses together with voice and video. Last quarter, we announced the launch of Office 365, the latest version of our cloud-based productivity platform. We are thrilled with the early results. In the first 10 weeks of Office 365 availability, the number of new customers exceeded what took us over 2 years to build with the first version of our business productivity online service. Also, we've seen Office 365 customers buy more products and drive new revenue streams. For example, when we've won a competitive bid in the enterprise for messaging and email, 80% of the new customers have bought SharePoint and Lync, in addition to Exchange. And historically, small businesses have only bought Office. But today with Office 365, 80% of the time, we've seen them buy the bundle of SharePoint, Lync and Exchange. Now let's move on to Server & Tools, which posted 10% revenue growth and grew faster than the server market. Our multiyear license revenue continued to perform well and grew double digits this quarter. Enterprise Services revenue was up 17%. Windows Server premium and System Center revenues grew mid-teens as the buildout of private cloud environments and the virtualization of data centers has increased server density and has shifted buying behaviors toward our premium enterprise offering. Our data platform business also continued to perform well. SQL Server premium revenue grew nearly 20% this quarter as customers increasingly look to SQL Server to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workloads. We continue to build on our strong Server & Tools portfolio. At our BUILD Developer Conference in September, we took the wraps off Windows Server 8, the next major release of the world's most used server operating system, which will be cloud-optimized to work in both private and hybrid cloud scenarios. In addition, we highlighted our data platform with the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012. We also announced our plans to support Apache Hadoop, both on Windows Azure and Windows Server to embrace big data. Next, I'll move to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 19%. Online advertising revenue was up nearly 21%, driven primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.7%, up 30 basis points this quarter and 350 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, we made progress in differentiating our offering by deepening Bing's social integration with Facebook and Twitter and made enhancements that simplify decision-making and task-completion. While Online Services improved its year-over-year operating performance, we continued to face monetization challenges which we are partnering closely with Yahoo! to resolve. Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division where revenue grew 9%, and we continued our leadership of the U.S. console market. Gears of War 3, which is only available on Xbox, effectively kicked off the holiday season and sold 3 million units in its first week of release. Gaming is an important component of living room entertainment, and in addition to blockbusters such as Forza 4, Dance Central 2, Halo Anniversary and Kinect Sports Season 2, there will be over 70 Kinect titles available for the holidays. Beyond gaming, next quarter is also when nearly 35 million Xbox LIVE users will begin to enjoy the new television content and experiences from our announced partnerships. During the quarter, we released the updated version of Windows Phone to market, and it has received favorable reviews from both industry press and our customers. We also signed a broad agreement with Samsung that includes increased collaboration on the development and marketing of Windows Phones. Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold was driven by the following: First, we saw an increase in royalty costs resulting from strong transactional sales on Xbox LIVE and the increased sales of royalty-bearing Xbox 360 games, notably Gears of War 3. Second, Enterprise Services continued to grow rapidly. And third, online service costs increased, which included Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to compensation changes, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. In the first quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.20, an increase of 25%, and we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. So in summary, we saw broad-based strength in our businesses and got off to a good start to the year, both in revenue and EPS. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.\nPeter S. Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Divisions. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we experienced in the past several quarters, with PC growth in emerging markets significantly outpacing growth in developed markets. Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. Transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will likely lag the overall PC market for both the second quarter and full fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets and the prior-year launch impact. In addition, when updating your models, remember that last year, we recognized $224 million of revenue related to the Office 2010 Tech Guarantee. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow about 20%. Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business. Our #1 priority is to resolve the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are working very closely with Yahoo! on bridging the RPS gap. As we improve RPS, revenue should track the online advertising market more closely. Moving onto the Entertainment & Devices Division. Including Skype, we now expect revenue to grow low double digits for the second quarter and high teens for the full fiscal year. Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. We expect COGS growth to have similar dynamics to what we experienced the past 3 quarters. Growth will be driven by increased Xbox console sales, Xbox LIVE royalty costs, the inclusion of Skype, Enterprise Services and online costs, including Yahoo! traffic acquisition costs. We have adjusted our fiscal year operating expense guidance to include Skype and the associated integration costs. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be $28.6 billion to $29.2 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the second quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year. For the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double digits compared to the prior fiscal year. As I discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation: investing in growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We are investing in the significant growth opportunities we see for our businesses by building integrated products that deliver a differentiated value proposition and accelerating our growth in compelling scenarios like real-time communications with the acquisition of Skype. We will also continue to return cash to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our dividend 25%, and we are continuing our $40 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in 2008, of which $11.2 billion remain. In summary, our financial results this quarter build upon an already strong financial foundation, one that provides stability while at the same time giving us the flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill, and we'll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Carol, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Adam Holt, Morgan Stanley.\nAdam H. Holt: My question is about Skype. Is 100% of the Skype revenue going to be in the E&D segment? And if it is, it looks like the revenue and earnings contribution or OpEx contribution is a little bit lower than I would have expected. Are there any write-downs or any shifts or any kind of transitional issues that we should be thinking about in terms of the run rate for Skype, relative to what it was historically?\nPeter S. Klein: Well, there's going to be integration associated costs, some amortization of IP, things like that, that you may or may not be considering. But yes, it'll all appear in E&D.\nOperator: The next question is from Rick Sherlund, Nomura.\nRichard G. Sherlund: On Skype, Peter, can you just talk a little bit about the model for Skype? What are you going to do different to get the revenues up? How do you monetize Skype? And then also just on Ultrabooks, you had that issue in Thailand with the floods that Western Digital said is going to take out a lot of production. Are you anticipating any problem in PCs? And maybe that shifts the market over to solid-state, and these Ultrabooks look kind of interesting. Any reasonable leads that we could see some actual acceleration in the market from adoption of Ultrabooks? Or are you thinking we might see some slowdown because of what we've seen in Thailand?\nPeter S. Klein: Let me -- I'll start with the Skype question, and then we'll get to the other question. Obviously, we -- the first thing I'll say is we closed the deal last week, so we're real-time doing a lot of the great work on the product integration planning. We've got folks here sort of in the building as we speak really working hard on what the plans are going to be, and so I think, over time, it will become more clear. I think as we've been talking about since we announced the acquisition, the opportunities are incredibly exciting across the portfolio of our products, whether it's Lync or Windows Live Messenger or Xbox or on the phone. And so I think not only are there great opportunities to integrate across our product portfolio but, as they were working on even before we announced the acquisition, new revenue opportunities related to advertising and premium services, so all of that's coming together as we speak. And mostly, we're incredibly excited to get to work together more fully now that the deal has closed. In terms of your question about Thailand, first thing I want to say, obviously, is our thoughts go out to all the individuals that are affected there, and we're thinking about them. In terms of the impact of that, you're correct, it doesn't impact solid-state, which is good. And I would say this about, overall, the impact. I think, historically, the global supply chain has been pretty resilient to occurrences like this. And so over time, we'll have to watch this very carefully to see kind of what the overall impact is.\nOperator: The next question is from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Peter, I was just wondering, the Windows attach and inventory boost was a nice tick up this quarter. And I'm just wondering, is it -- if you could kind of give us a sense of how you're doing from a piracy standpoint in terms of the -- in terms of that's what helped the quarter, did you actually see more inventory build?\nPeter S. Klein: We saw both. So with some inventory and some attach, we're definitely seeing improvements in attach sort of across-the-board, so definitely making some improvements on piracy, and then some of that improvement was a little bit of inventory build as we head into the holiday. But to your point, we are definitely seeing improvements in attach this quarter, which was a big driver.\nOperator: Walter Pritchard, Citi.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Bill, I'm wondering, as you look at the OSD loss this year, you actually lost less money than we thought on a revenue number that was lower. Just first wondering if you could comment going forward if we should expect that this level of losses is what we should sustain. And then as you look at the model overall, we saw lower losses, but that didn't flow through as much to the bottom line as we might have expected. How are you thinking about any upside that comes through the lower losses in OSD and impacting the bottom line and the company overall?\nPeter S. Klein: As we've been saying, the key to this profitability of this business is to continue to grow our revenue, and to do that, we have to continue to grow share and grow our revenue for Search, and that's certainly what we're focused on. Obviously, it's a high fixed-cost business. Within that, we have been managing the expenses, and so we are taking every opportunity to manage the profitability of that business, but by far, the most important thing to continue to increase the profitability is to make sure we can continue to grow the revenue, and to do that, we need to make sure we get the revenue for Search up. So that's what we're laser focused on. That's what we've got people working closely with Yahoo! on every day, and we'll continue to focus on that, and that's the most leveraged thing we can do for OSD profitability and, ultimately, the company's bottom line.\nOperator: Kash Rangan, Merrill Lynch.\nKash G. Rangan: Just wanted to drill into the Skype contribution a little bit more. Just wondering if there are some products you're going to be discontinuing, certain services or new things, conversely, that you're going to be adding. And also this onetime transition-type expenses, Peter, if you could quantify how much of that will impact the P&L that you've already guided to in the quarter just to get an understanding of how much will go away as you settle into a steady state on the Skype business.\nPeter S. Klein: Clearly, it's a little premature to talk about sort of changes and what we're going to do with the products. As I said, mostly, we've seen this week is an incredibly excitement with their engineering people and our engineering people getting together to talk about all the opportunities. As we flesh those plans out, obviously, we'll have a lot more to say about that. And in terms of the expense side, what I would say is everything that's included there is included in our guidance framework that we gave you, so that's probably the best guidance I can give you on those expenses.\nOperator: Philip Winslow, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Just wanted to focus back on MBD. You guys have been trending at or above, frankly, the PC shipments for several quarters now. Where do you think we stand in just sort of the adoption cycle, particularly in a large enterprise of Office 2010, and especially when we think about rolling sort of the ecosystem out? Where are we in that? And also, Bill, just one quick follow-up. I think you gave the transactional revenue growth for MBD, but I'm not sure if you gave that for Server & Tools.\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, on the last question, the transactional revenue for Server & Tools should track the hardware market.\nPhilip Winslow: Sorry, I meant this quarter.\nPeter S. Klein: This quarter, sorry. I'll answer the question. On MBD, it's really interesting. There's a couple of things going on, particularly in the enterprise that really provide sustenance for the ongoing business. One is the great sort of traction we get from the integration of SharePoint and Exchange and Lync with Office 2010. So not only is there really good resonance for the Office application, but increasingly, as Bill talked about, customers are deploying communications and collaboration technology with that. And there is a lot of legs to go on the productivity server applications piece of the business. Second thing I would add is the cloud. Increasingly, every time we go in and talk to enterprises about productivity, they want to have a conversation about public cloud services, not necessarily because they want to deploy public cloud tomorrow, but they really want to understand the roadmap and understand where that's leading, and we found that creates an incredibly good conversation that then leads to a broader conversation of a long-term commitment to our platform and applications. And I think, obviously, that's a long-term phenomenon with a lot of room still to go. So the way I think about it, yes, for the Office application, particularly on the transactional side, coming off of launch here, there's some difficult comparables. But on the enterprise side, with the additional products and the cloud, that's really been the driver of our growth, and it is really a long-term catalyst.\nBill Koefoed: And Phil, transactional for STB was low-single digits, which we believe was roughly in line with the server hardware market, as Peter mentioned.\nOperator: Brendon Barnicle, Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendon Barnicle: I had 2 quick ones on the guidance. Peter, first on the Windows and Windows Live. In the previous quarters, you've talked about business PCs no longer outpacing consumer. That language isn't in. Is that no longer as big a factor? And then second, on the Server & Tools, you've pretty substantially increased your guidance around the Enterprise Services revenue. Wondering what's accounting for that uptick, and we saw good strength in that in the quarter as well.\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, we are still seeing business outpacing consumer, so thank you for that. And on the Enterprise Services, it's interesting, we're really seeing healthy demand for our consulting services to help people architect and deploy sort of the next generation of the products that we're bringing to market, both in Server & Tools and MBD. You can see the connection there, right, Server & Tools continuing to grow double digits. People are really investing in their data centers and in the private cloud, and we're helping people do that and also think about and contemplate what that's going to mean to migrate to the public cloud ultimately. Same thing is true with the productivity server applications. How do you start deploying Lync and SharePoint? How do you think about transitioning to Office 365 over time? So we're really seeing -- we've got a strong pipeline of business there, and that's why you're seeing the growth, both in the cost, frankly, to service demand because, obviously, it's a variable cost business.\nOperator: Brent Thill, UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter, just on the enterprise business, any changes in customer behavior as the quarter progressed? Or as you look at your pipeline, I think there's obviously been some concern over some more scrutiny around some larger deal sizes. Was just curious in terms of what you're seeing.\nPeter S. Klein: No, we didn't see any changes in that flavor throughout the quarter.\nBill Koefoed: And I would just add, I mean, unearned came in kind of right in line with our expectations, so we continue to execute well on the annuity side for sure.\nOperator: Mark Moerdler, Bernstein.\nMark L. Moerdler: Want to drill in a little bit on the hosting costs, which on MBD was a big chunk of the increase in cost of revenue. How much do you think this is pointing to a lower margin? Has Office 365 and Dynamics Online gained traction? If so, what do you think we should be modeling against?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, no, a great question. Obviously, specifically in the short run, delivering a service has a different margin profile than delivering software. It's going to have a lower gross margin percentage but, ultimately, should have a higher gross profit dollar. So what you should be thinking about is as we scale, you see accelerated revenue growth at a lower gross margin percentage and a higher gross profit dollars.\nBill Koefoed: But I would add, we're such in early days there that I don't think it's had a big impact on our business performance to date.\nPeter S. Klein: That is correct. That was a long-term business model perspective, but it's not material today.\nOperator: John DiFucci, JPMC.\nJohn S. DiFucci: Peter, I think bookings were flat this quarter from a year ago, and I assume you got some benefits from foreign exchange, so on a constant currency basis, they were probably down a little bit. This is after some 4 quarters of some really nice growth here. I think the last time it was flat or down was during the recession. Is this simply a sign of some difficult macro -- of a difficult macro environment? Or was it just a difficult comp year-over-year or even a strong quarter last quarter that might have pulled some business forward?\nPeter S. Klein: Exactly. It's definitely more of the latter. Across-the-board, all of our metrics for revenue, transactional, unearned, CMBs, all what we expected, and it's really just a function of sort of the year-over-year comps and the strong Q4 that we had, and we're excited about the pipeline as we head into Q2. And as you know, Q1 is probably our lowest sort of selling quarter anyway during the year seasonally. So we feel good as we head into Q2.\nBill Koefoed: Well, and we reflected that in our unearned guidance that we gave you last quarter, which was we expected sequential kind of Q4 to Q1 but sequential -- sequentially, it would decline a little bit more than normal. So I'd say, it kind of came in line with what we had expected it to be, as I said earlier.\nOperator: Colin Gillis, BGC Financial.\nColin Gillis: Peter, can you just update us on the percentage of cash that's offshore? And just give us a sense as to how much onshore cash you need to have to comfortably run operations?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, of our cash, about $51 billion is offshore.\nColin Gillis: Okay. And what percentage of cash do you need to keep onshore just to keep the lights on and the dividends getting paid?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, that's not how we think about it. We've got plenty of cash. It's not an issue.\nOperator: Brad Reback, Oppenheimer.\nBrad Reback: Peter, as we think about the Xbox LIVE business, you've greatly expanded the content available there. Are there opportunities here for additional premium service contracts with people? Or is it going to be mainly transactional to get that content?\nPeter S. Klein: Well, without being specific about this particular case, I think from a business model perspective, you're thinking about it right. There's lots of opportunities to think about how you might monetize delivering unique and compelling entertainment experiences, and that's clearly kind of how we think about it. That's sort of been the strategy with Xbox business all along, right? Once you get that incredible installed base of engaged users, how can you deliver a set of interactive entertainment experiences sort of across-the-board and what that means, and sort of from a business model perspective, there's lots of interesting ways to monetize that.\nBill Koefoed: Yes, I mean, I would just add, as you've seen in our results, the Xbox LIVE has been phenomenal, both in terms of growth of users, growth in revenues. The content that we have coming out this holiday season is going to be super exciting, and obviously, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we're going to have over 70 games out this holiday season. So we believe that we have the most compelling entertainment experience in the living room. And hopefully, for those of you who don't have it, you should go out and check it out this holiday season because it's going to be pretty exciting.\nOperator: Ed Maguire, CLSA. Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division I just wanted to ask a question following the announcement of your Samsung deal. What your assumptions are for royalties around mobile phones? And also, whether you've built in any assumptions from phone into Entertainment & Devices?\nPeter S. Klein: So in terms of the deal, we haven't announced any of the specific terms of the deal. We talked conceptually about the deal, and we're super excited about their commitment to the platform and all of that, related to that, is included in the Entertainment & Devices Division.\nOperator: Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen.\nGregg Moskowitz: I just had a follow-up to Adam's question. You raised your guidance, Peter, for the EDD business this year to high teens growth although, of course, it now includes Skype. So a couple of questions around that. First, do you still expect to see mid-teens growth for the EDD business organically? And second, I don't know that there are that many long-term Skype subscribers, but is there going to be a deferred revenue write-down for Skype? And if so, how much?\nPeter S. Klein: I think it's -- why don't we -- the second question, we'll talk to you about when we actually report Skype results after the next quarter because we disclosed that last week. And I -- on the E&D business, I would say generally, yes, our guidance is in line with guidance we've given before.\nOperator: Tim Klasell, Stifel, Nicolaus.\nTim Klasell: A follow-on question to Brendon's comment about business PCs growing faster than, I think, consumer PCs. Where do you think we are in the enterprise Windows 7 upgrade cycle? Are we middle innings, we getting towards the end? How do you feel about that?\nPeter S. Klein: Yes, no, I think we're middle innings. I think we expect that dynamic of business PCs growing faster to last throughout this fiscal year at least, so I would say middle innings.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And Jason Maynard, Wells Fargo.\nJason Maynard: Since fixing the Yahoo! RPS challenges, obviously an issue for improving OSD, how do you guys go about sort of ensuring that there won't be any disruption to your efforts, given all of the, call it, market talk about what's happening with Yahoo!? Because clearly if it's a quieter [ph] split-up, there's also sorts of potential outcomes that could cause maybe more disruption to what you're trying to accomplish. So how do you kind of preserve the process, if you will?\nPeter S. Klein: We've got a really good relationship with Yahoo!. This is a long-term alliance. Everybody is working really well together. We're super focused on what we need to do, and no matter what, that's the goal at hand. And the teams are working really well together to do that. So that's kind of how we're approaching it and focused on it. Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thanks again for joining us today, and have a good afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's presentation.

You can find the details of the adjustments and reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Chris and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In many ways, our fourth quarter results reflect the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. The consumer x86 PC market declined as users continued to prioritize devices to touch and ability. At the same time we saw continued strength in our enterprise product and cloud solution and increased adoption of our consumer services. This quarter our Windows business declined as the device market continued to evolve beyond the traditional PC. We are working to transition the business into this modern era of computing taking advantage of the new scenarios enabled our Windows 8. As we said before, given the complexity of the ecosystem this journey will take but we continue to make incremental progress. In June, we released the public preview of Windows 8.1. It blends the desktop and modern experience. It has new features and improvements in areas such as personalization, search, built-in app and cloud connectivity. Windows 8.1 will be a free update to existing Windows 8 users and will be made available to OEMs in August, less than one year since launch. To increase and improve retail distribution, we entered into a strategic partnership with BestBuy to create a Windows store in over 600 BestBuy locations. These store-within-a-store locations provide a large scale hands-on consumer experience that showcases Microsoft devices and services. The percentage (inaudible) devices available at retail continues to improve. The first 8x Windows tablet became available at retail a few weeks ago. It has legacy application compatibility, includes Microsoft Office and retails for less than $400. We expect additional compelling small screen devices to be available in the coming months. Less than a year ago, we launched Surface RT and Surface Pro, each with a unique value proposition. Surface is one part of our journey to bring innovative, compelling Windows devices to market in a modern era of computing. (Inaudible) analyze our progress and fine-tune our action plan as needed. Hear what we did this quarter. We reduced the price of Surface RT by $150 to $349 per device. As a result of this price change as well as inventory adjustments for related parts and accessories we recorded a $900 million charge to our income statement. While this resulted in a negative $0.07 impact on earnings, we believe this pricing adjustment will accelerate Surface RT adoption and position us better for long term success. We also increased retail distribution in the quarter. Surface is now available in 29 markets and 10,000 retail locations. We expanded the availability of Surface to our business and institutional customers. Through our new channel expansion program, commercial customers are able to purchase Surface devices from authorized resellers in the U.S. Over the next few months we will authorize commercial distributors and resellers in more countries. So in summary on Windows, we are working hard with our partners to gain share in the evolving and growing device markets. I want to be very clear, we know we have to do better and that's one reason we made a strategic and organizational changes we made last week. With over 1.5 billion Windows users around the world, a transition of this magnitude takes time. We are confident we are moving in the right direction. Now on to our enterprise business which continues to be strong. We closed out the year with record on our revenue up $22.4 billion as businesses continued to make long term commitments to the Microsoft platform. Within our server and tools business, we continue to make significant improvements in performance reliability and scalability with SQL server. As a result, customers are increasingly moving mission critical and BI workloads to the platform. Our SQL Server has been the unit share leader in the market for some time. It has consistently outgrown in the market over the past 12 months and is now the second largest database in revenue share. We recently announced the next versions of Windows Server and System Center which will continue to deliver on our Cloud OS vision. With new features and enhancements in virtualization, storage and networking, we are empowering our customers to more officially manage their application services and their private, hosted and public cloud infrastructures. In Windows Azure, we continue to innovate and broaden our cloud platform offering. We recently announced an important enterprise partnership with Oracle. It will enable customers to our Oracle software on Hyper-V and in Windows Azure. In June, we announced the public review of Windows Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet making Microsoft the first multinational organization to offer public cloud services in China. As a result of the greater choice and flexibility, we are seeing increased customer tractions, those in terms of an increase in Enterprise customers but also the average deal size. Our productivity solutions continue to be a top priority for CIOs. As Enterprise customers look to modernize their productivity infrastructures, they are increasingly turning to Office 365. We recently announced the expansion of commercial availability into several new markets, making Office 365 available in over 125 markets worldwide. I\u2019m pleased to share that momentum is accelerating. An Office 365 is now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. During the quarter, we saw ongoing momentum for our consumer services such as Office 365 Home Premium, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE, Skype and Outlook.com. By giving consumers rich, high value experiences across productivity, litigations and entertainment, these services can help you about products and our overall ecosystem, our strategic advantage in today\u2019s marketplace where the line between home and work is boring for many customers. Our unified communication offering of Skype and Lync are great example of our customer enterprise products can be mutually reinforcing and create more opportunity for Microsoft. In summary, the third quarter contains many of the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. We continue to make important stride for our strategy, to create a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses, to empower them for the activities they value the most. Some of our investments are already paying off while others reinforce the foundation that positions us for future growth and profitability. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris to get more details about this quarter before I come back to share thoughts on the first quarter of fiscal 2014.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. First, I\u2019m going to review our overall results and then I'll move onto the details by business segment. Revenue was up 3% to $19.2 billion and operating income declined 11% to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59. Foreign exchange had $257 million or 1 percentage point negative impact revenue this quarter and $177 million or 3 percentage point negative impact to net income. From a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. was strong relative to other regions. Annuity revenue continued to be strong growing 13%. We have record unearned revenue of $22.4 billion and our contracted-not-billed balance was approximately $21 billion. Now, to the result of the Windows division, our revenue declined 5% this quarter. The x86 PC market continued to decline while business PC showed modest growth. We estimate consumer PCs declined more than 20%. As a result, OEM revenue declined 15%. OEM revenue lagged the PC market primarily due to market dynamics in China and lower ASPs reflecting the introduction of our small screen touch offering in the current period incentive program. Non-OEM revenue grew 22% driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing as businesses across all areas and segments continue to value the Windows platform. This quarter we saw continued progress in the transition from Windows XP and today almost three-quarters of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. Volume licensing of Windows delivered more than $4 billion in revenue this year. Next, I\u2019ll walk through our Server and Tools business which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and double-digit bookings growth. Product revenue grew 9%, driven primarily by growth in premium versions of Windows, Server and SQL Server .Our cloud momentum continues with strong customer adoption, upsell the higher level services and increased innovation. We released a number of Azure services, including mobility, media and website services and a growing number of customers who are already using multiple services for the cloud platform needs. We added 25% more enterprise customers this quarter and now over 50% of the Fortune 500 are using Windows Azure. In the data center, system center revenue grew 14% and the premium version of Windows Server continued to see significant revenue growth. Hyper-V, our virtualization product, continued to gain market share over the past year. Companies such as Aston Martin and Grant Thornton continue to look to Hyper-V and System Center to deliver their critical business application. In the data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. Last month, we announced SQL Server 2014, the next version of our data platform which has in-memory capabilities built right into the core database. We also announced Power VI for Office 365, a cloud based BI solutions that combine power of SQL server with the familiarity of Office. Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 2%. Within that, business revenue grew 7%, driven by 10% growth in annuity revenue. Consumer revenue declined 27%. Results in our consumer business were driven by declines in the consumer x86 PC market and the shift to subscription, offset in part by attach gains. As our customers transition to the new subscription model, there is a short term impact to revenue due to the changes in the timing of revenue recognition but over time we expect our revenue to grow and become more recurring and predictable. With the subscription model, we are providing greater value to our customers with the frequent product updates, new cloud services and attractive pricing. We saw strong early adoption of the subscription offering and now have more than 1 million Office 365 Home Premium subscribers. It's been a big year for Office 365 and as Amy said, it's now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. This was our strongest quarter ever with more net fee adds in the quarter than all of fiscal 2012. We are seeing strong upsell with one in three Office 365 now running premium workloads. In terms of our productivity offerings, we continue to see strength of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync each growing double-digits. Lync revenue grew over 30% driving our enterprise communication business to deliver more than $1 billion revenue in this fiscal year. Additionally, we met a key milestone in the Lync and Skype integration and users can now seamlessly communicate in voice and IM across the two services. Next, I'll move on to the Online Services division where revenue grew 9% and operating performance improved by $107 million or 22%. Online advertising revenue was up 11% driven by both rate and volume improvements in our search business. In the Entertainment and Devices division, revenue grew 8%. Xbox LIVE transaction revenue grew nearly 20% and is providing economic opportunities for publishers in the soft console market. This quarter we announced our next generation gaming and entertainment console Xbox One and at E3 we showcased in impressive line of games that will be coming to the new platform. Progress with Windows Phone continues as our partners, including Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and HTC are delivering new phones at a broader range of price points. Telefonica also recently announced an enhanced marketing effort to promote Windows Phone 8 devices and with the recent Sprint announcement, Windows Phone 8 devices will now be available on all major U.S. operators. Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 14% principally driven by Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure. Operating expenses grew 9% primarily related to sales and marketing for Surface and Windows 8. This quarter, our CapEx increased as we continued to invest in our cloud infrastructure and expand our geographic footprint to support the growth in our online businesses. And finally we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. Now, I'll turn the call back to Amy for our outlook.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Chris. Before I discuss our expectations for the first quarter, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing last week\u2019s announcements on One Microsoft. If you haven\u2019t already done so, I encourage you to read out strategy memo and Steve Ballmer's email to employees. Microsoft is rallying to hide a single strategy. As a part of this, we implemented a new organizational structure that will allow us to advance our strategy more quickly and more efficiently. We are currently in the process of determining what changes, if any, will be made to our reporting segment. In late September, we will host an analyst event, here in Redmond, at which point we will discuss our strategy, our new organizational structure and any changes to our reporting segments. We will also give more thoughts on our full-year outlook at that time. Please look for additional details from Chris over the coming weeks. Now, moving on to our expectations for the first quarter. In Windows, we expect revenues to continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer x86 PC market. Excluding the impact of the Windows upgrade offer in the prior year, OEM revenue should account for approximately 65% of the division's revenue and should decline mid teens. Non-OEM revenue should account for approximately 35% of the division's revenue primarily reflecting revenue from volume licensing and Surface including Surface RT at new price points. While updating your model, please keep in mind that in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, prior to the launch of Surface, OEM accounted for 75% of the division's total revenue. Within Server & Tools, product revenue including transactional and multi-year licensing is about 80% of the division's total. Our Enterprise services is the remaining 20%. We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow high-single digits. In the Microsoft Business Division, we expect business revenue to account for approximately 85% of the division's total. Our consumer revenue should account for the remaining 15%. Business revenue should grow mid-single digit reflecting low double-digit growth in annuity and the shift from transaction licensing to Cloud services. With the ongoing shift to subscription, consumer revenue will lag the x86 consumer PC market by approximately 5 percentage points, even as the tax continues to grow. This excludes the impact of the Office upgrade offer in the prior year. As a reminder, business revenue accounted for 80% of total revenue in the prior year. In the online services division, we expect revenue to grow low double digits reflecting growth in service revenue partially offset by lower display revenue. With the Entertainment and Devices divisions, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as the industry waits the next generation console. For the first quarter, cost of goods sold will reflect surface as well as the impact of the capital expenditures we made in fiscal 2013. As a result, COG should grow over 20%. Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset the interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest environment, we expect these items to generally offset. For the first quarter regarding CapEx, we expect continued growth in our investments and our global data centers. Excluding the impact of the Windows and Office upgrade offers, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal pattern. Now, turning briefly to the full fiscal year, we are reducing our operating expense guidance. We now expect fiscal year 2014 operating expenses to be $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion with growth in the low teens for the first quarter. We expect our tax rates to be between 18% and 21% for the full fiscal year. In summary, as we look back on the year, fiscal 2013 was a pivotal time for Microsoft. With Windows 8, we increased our addressable market. Our OEM partners have started capitalizing on the new opportunities delivering a wide range of new Windows hardware, from phones, the tablets to new PCs. We extended our first party devices through Surface and the announcement of Xbox One. We modernized productivity with Office 365 changing our business model. For the first time, both businesses and consumers can now access Office through subscription. We took share from key competitors and key enterprise markets. We added several new features, including infrastructure as a service capabilities for Windows Azure. With Azure we are fundamentally changing the way businesses manage their IT infrastructure and we continue the expansion of our data center footprint which enables us to deliver high value services and experiences globally. As we look to fiscal 2014, we are focused on a single strategy. With our new organizational structure, we believe we'll be able to execute more quickly and more efficiently driving long term growth profitability and shareholder value. With that I'll turn it back to Chris and we'll take some questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. We want to get to question from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And we do have our first question from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.\nWalter Pritchard: I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you talked about COGs in Q1 and you don\u2019t mention COGs, obviously you have Xbox One launch in the second quarter. Could you give us some guidance about how we should think about that product having an impact on margins, maybe comparing it to 360 or anything else you could do to help us directionally with the COGs impact on Q1?\nAmy Hood: So as we transition to a device services company, I think you need to keep in mind that we expect CapEx continue to grow throughout our business, specifically the Xbox One and the new generation of consoles and launches I think you should think about that, as to think about all console life cycles, and so keep that in mind as you model COGs and seasonality throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Can you give us some color on the short term revenue impact of the move to the cloud, is it just MBD, is it also server and tools, how does the license revenue convert to cloud revenue?\nAmy Hood: Mark, thanks for that question. It is primarily an MBD where we had a higher percentage of our revenue, that was accounted for transactionally both on the business side and in the consumer side. So I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen us in our outlook for Q1 try to start to explain that transition to consumer by saying that we expect to lag the PC market by approximately 5 percentage points while attaching pieces.\nMark Moerdler: Is there a similar lag on the transactional side on the enterprise?\nAmy Hood: Yes, you can see it when we gave the guidance for the business segment. We said 10% growth on the annuity and so that would clearly say that part of that is a transactional move from recognize upfront revenue to multi-year licensing agreement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Just a follow up on (inaudible), first, Amy, obviously you go to a subscription model, you have less upfront, lower billing versus license, why don\u2019t you give us a sort of a backdoor, a dollar of cloud or 365 revenue would have been, and that for sure should have been $3 relative to license, so just we can turn it back on to help with that transition and also actually to Walter\u2019s question about Xbox COGs, maybe you could add a sense for -- if this cycle really should be any different than previous cycles when you thought about pricing relative to the cost of the console?\nAmy Hood: I will try to remember both of those questions. Let me take the second question as it\u2019s the most recent in my mind. I would not think about this console cycle being any different from prior cycles. So let me go back to the first question, which is can I give examples, I believe we probably think about the transition front, we used to recognize revenue when we bought something upfront transactionally versus buying a subscription from us. I will give an example. If you used to buy a license from us as a consumer and paid up for example $100 for (inaudible), we recognize $100 in the period in which it was purchased. Now if that same person went and bought Office 365 Premium, and once it\u2019s activated, we recognize the revenue over the period of the purchase which is 12 months, we recognize it ratably.\nChris Suh: Yeah, thanks. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question. I was wondering focusing on the Server & Tools division you guys came in with high single-digit growth versus the guidance of low double-digit growth. Also can you walk us through some of the elements that perhaps transpired during the quarter than caused that gap of why it came in slightly below expectations there and to what extent was the shift towards subscription a part of that.\nAmy Hood: Let me start by saying Server & Tools had a very good quarter. We continue to win share in virtualization, the SQL Server and could continue to go faster than both Oracle and IBM. Revenue did grow 9%, which importantly far outpaced the underlying hardware market. And over the period of the quarter, we did see the hardware market fundamentally coming a bit lower than we had expected.\nKeith Weiss: Okay.\nChris Suh: Great. Thanks Keith. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you very much. Amy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the incentive pricing you\u2019ve been doing, not just on your own devices like Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks but also in the OEM market. And if you haven\u2019t done incentive pricing at the OEM level, is there a chance we could see the strategy going forward at a way to help lower the price points of consumer PCs and then hence trying to spur demand? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Heather. I think it\u2019s a great question. I do think that we should think about incentives and all of our programs, including a Small Screen Touch view that we\u2019ve launched, as a way to increase the breadth of our Windows devices available across all price points.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Heather. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.\nRick Sherlund: Thanks. I wonder if you have any perspective for us on you got Intel\u2019s Haswell chip shipping now 8.1 coming in probably October. Are you sensing that OEMs are trying to manage inventories down for the time being and waiting cautiously Intel suggested that maybe you\u2019re seeing some inventory liquidation. So I wonder if you could just give us a sense of what you\u2019re hearing from the OEMs?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Rick. I think like the rest of the ecosystem, we are excited about the advances Intel has made with the fourth-generation core processor. And we\u2019re also looking forward to the next ADAM chip but was launched a little less than a month ago. I think it\u2019s little bit too early for me to say and like to wait and see how the quarter plays out.\nChris Suh: Rick, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes to us from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Amy, on the expenses you are realizing next year down and it looks like your expense growth will materially slow from what it was this year. I\u2019m just curious if you could just help us understand where that\u2019s coming from and how you\u2019re thinking about that for next year.\nAmy Hood: Well, actually I think this is I feel good because I think in some ways the re-org we announced last week along with our increased focus and our new single strategy has allowed us to really look and say what are the things we\u2019re going to put behind and focus to improve our execution. And so I feel quite good about our ability to do that and you heard us say before many of the reasons we did this re-org are about doing things better and more efficiently.\nChris Suh: Thank you. Thanks Brent. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.\nEd Maguire: Hi. Good afternoon. Amy, you had discussed your increased CapEx this quarter and I was wondering if you could address the margin profile of your cloud services. In the comments, you discussed how you have higher datacenter cost and what I\u2019d like to understand is whether this is temporary as you are ramping up this transition towards subscription business or whether this actually changes the growth margin profile of these revenues. Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Ed. It\u2019s a good question. Every transition to device and services company that is a multiyear commitment to evolve our business. You should expect the CapEx will continue to grow as we ramp that business. With the expansion of Azure service offerings and the continued momentum and Office 365 as well as our consumer services, investing in this global footprint to meet customer demand is incredibly important and quite strategic. And really the question is, our ability to feel smart way and that will create an advantage for us, we can pass along to our customers. And so I look forward to being able to move these datacenters globally to reach more people with more services.\nChris Suh: Okay. Thanks, Ed. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Amy your CapEx this quarter was about $700 million, greater than $700 million, greater than you guided just 90 days ago. Why was there such a sudden change, I know, Chris I think explained why it was high -- higher and why it\u2019s going to be higher going forward? But why was it such a sudden change so dramatically just in this quarter and will this planned increase going forward affect your ability to do things like buyback shares?\nAmy Hood: Yeah. Our -- in Q4 really as we continue to add Azure services, in fact we added over 80 this quarter and with this increase demand of Office 365 and then $1.5 billion annual run rate, up from just a $1 billion in Q3. I would think about that as our ability to increase demand and meet demand globally with our services, and so doing that in Q4 was important, because you want to be ahead of demand there.\nJohn DiFucci: So was that something that was unexpected, you just said, higher demand in Q4?\nAmy Hood: We are accelerating.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay. Okay. And will this affect your ability to buyback shares going forward, this increase in CapEx?\nAmy Hood: No. I mean, our cash returned $2.9 billion this quarter, I recall for the year and we\u2019ll continue take a balanced approach to capital allocation with those investments, acquisition really make sense and return the capital to shareholders.\nChris Suh: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Amy congrats on your first conference call as CFO. My question had to do with Windows side of the business. I know that you had a impairment charge for the inventory clearance. But even if I backed, if I add that back, it looks like the operating margin of the Windows business were sequentially lower, quite materially just wanted to get some insights into what drove that from the March quarter into the June quarter? As you look further out into the operating margins of the Windows business, given that you are going to be focusing on Surface? How should we think about the margin structure, I guess you have a volume threshold to clear before you can start to make a margin, given that it\u2019s more of a product? But really two parts to that question, love to get your answers? Thank you so much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Kash. Let me address, I think were the two components. The first component, like a general question about margins this quarter for Windows, as you said they were impacted by Surface. And the second one is, by the marketing investment we continue to make in the ecosystem to move forward. Overall, I think, as you think about the Windows division as we reported, obviously since there was mix between hardware and software, you should continue to expect margins to reflect that mix.\nKash Rangan: Okay.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Kash. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nRoss MacMillan: Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to drill into the billings growth, where we adjust for the unearned and it\u2019s a lot higher for the server and tools business, which is obviously going through a condition towards more a subscription arrangements then it a lot higher there in the MBD segment? I\u2019m just wondering if you can compare and contrast why that might be, I understand the consumer piece in MBD. But is the other piece of it just that there are more sort of conditional licensing arrangements in MBD with enterprise customers and so the impact from the transition is all the greater and that\u2019s why you see that more subdued billings growth rate in MBD? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Ross, thank you. It\u2019s always terrific when someone answers their own question. You actually have it exactly correct.\nRoss MacMillan: Great. Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks. Thanks Ross. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hi. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Just a follow on a bit on Kash\u2019s question. With Windows revenue coming in where it did. We are getting a few questions from investors about how Windows fared this quarter relative to the PC unit? If we were to exclude tablet revenues both Surface and otherwise. Just wondering Amy if you might be able to say roughly on year-over-year basis how Windows PC revenue compared to the low double-digit PC unit decline cited by the IDC\u2019s and Gartner\u2019s?\nAmy Hood: Yeah. Chris actually covered that a bit in his comment but let me reiterate, because I do understand the question I think, which is relate to our OEM revenue 15%, down 15%. It was related, I believe to China, lower ASPs on the small stream SKU that we mentioned, as well as some of the incentive programs that we had in place during the quarter.\nGregg Moskowitz: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks Gregg. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yeah. Thank you and Amy welcome on the first earnings call. And I had a question on the business PC side, that was an area of strength for the Windows division and you saw some growth there? Can you talk a little bit about that, if that\u2019s kind of, if you see that as a sustainable number or is that still driven by the end of life for Windows XP? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: As we mentioned, our Windows business didn't make incremental progress in the business side. We expect that to continue in Q1. And with the end of life for Windows XP next year, we expect continued migration and today in the Enterprise about three quarters of desktops already run Windows 7.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thank you very much.\nChris Suh: Yeah. Thank you. Next question please, operator?\nOperator: All right. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks so much. Amy contracted-but unbilled was down sequentially from Q3, the first time we have seen that in the last two years, what is attributing to that shift?\nAmy Hood: Thank you. Actually I think our strong annuity growth, as well as our record unearned balance, I do believe -- support our belief that the strong performance of our multiyear license agreement is in place.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Operator. I think we have time for one more.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is going to come from Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital Markets. You line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question about the mix shift multiyear licensing across Microsoft that\u2019s been a big part of the story. It has been up about 5 percentage points year-over-year each quarter in fiscal 2013? Amy, I\u2019m just wondering as we look forward to fiscal \u201914, can we expect it to increase at that cliff or is the software assurance attach rates now getting high enough that that mix shift should start to moderate?\nAmy Hood: We have -- I continue to believe we will have double-digit annuity growth next year, so I think that shift you have seen especially if we continue to move people to our Cloud services, will continue.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thanks\nChris Suh: Thanks, Karl. Okay. So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings calls. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences and at our financial analyst meeting to be held in late September where we will share more details about our long-term strategies, the organizational structure and outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Thank you again for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 3, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-04-18 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Microsoft's fiscal year 2013 third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.]  I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, general manager of investor relations. Chris, you may begin.\nChris Suh: Thank you operator, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. With me today are Peter Klein, chief financial officer; Frank Brod, chief accounting officer; and John Seethoff, deputy general counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until April 18, 2014. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, protection or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to remind you all that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferral and recognition related to Windows, Office, and Xbox videogame and the expense related to the non-tax-deductible European Commission fine.  Details of the adjustments can be found in our financial summary slide deck and press release. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon everyone.  Before I get into my comments about the quarter, let me say a few words about the CFO transition we announced today.  As we all do throughout our careers, at various times we assess our personal and professional goals and priorities.  Sometimes we change jobs, sometimes we change companies, and sometimes we step back to focus on family and other personal goals. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, for me personally, it\u2019s a good time to refocus my priorities to spend time with family in a way I haven\u2019t previously had the chance.  I feel great that the company is on a path to an exciting future in devices and services, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of, and confident in, the finance organization. I look forward to working with my successor on the transition, including getting out and meeting with many of you.  I have truly enjoyed working with all of you.  And now on to the quarter. I\u2019m pleased to report we drove revenue and earnings per share growth of 8%, even as we navigate an evolving device market.  Our results reflect our diversified portfolio as well as the investments we have made in key strategic areas.  During the quarter, we launched the new Office, our enterprise cloud services continued to gain traction, and we continued to take market share in the data platform. Before I dive into more details on our progress in these areas, I want to address what\u2019s top of mind for many of you, which is our Windows business. There is no doubt that the device market is evolving.  Consumers and businesses are increasingly shifting their focus to touch and mobility, and as a result, they want touch-enabled computing devices that are ultrathin, lightweight, and have long battery life.  While Windows revenue has been impacted by the transition from the traditional PC to a new era of computing devices, the overall addressable markets are growing, and we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us. We built Windows 8 with touch and mobility at the center of the experience, which positions us well in this new era.  However, the transition is complicated, given the size of our hardware and software ecosystem.  We still have an immense amount of work to do, yet we feel good about the foundation we have laid and are optimistic about the long term success of Windows. I want to take some time now to be clear about where we are in this journey, and what we are doing to help drive this change.  With Windows 8, we are setting a new, accelerated pace for updates and innovations, as we focus on making the Windows experience richer and better. Since launch we have delivered several important updates to improve our mail, storage, search, music, and video services.  During the quarter, we also added to the Surface family of devices with Surface Pro, which combines the performance capabilities of a PC with a modern tablet design. Looking ahead, we will release the next version of Windows, codenamed Windows Blue, which further advances the vision of Windows 8 as well as responds to customer feedback.  The assortment of touch-enabled devices that are built for Windows 8 by our OEM partners is also improving. Over the last couple of months, we\u2019ve started seeing devices that take full advantage of Windows 8, and we expect to see more devices across more attractive price points over the coming months.  As part of this, we are also working closely with OEMs on a new suite of small touch devices powered by Windows.  These devices will have competitive price points, partly enabled by our latest OEM offerings designed specifically for these smaller devices, and will be available in the coming months. In the upcoming back to school selling season, we expect to see devices that incorporate advances from throughout the supply chain, including chipsets.  As well, Intel\u2019s fourth generation core processor will help enable new devices that combine performance benefits with power savings. Later in the year, we expect to see devices based on Intel\u2019s upcoming Bay Trail Atom processor, which promises to deliver tablets and hybrid PCs with extended battery life at competitive prices. Today in the Windows Store, there are six times as many apps since launch, and we expect more to be added as we gain traction with Windows 8 adoption.  In June, we will host Build, our developer conference, where we will provide more tools and information for developers to build great Windows 8 apps. In retail, we are working to improve the consumer purchasing experience.  Our initiatives include focused efforts to further educate and incentivize retail sales professionals and to have better in-store product differentiation. In summary, Windows is transforming to the new era of computing.  As I said on our last earnings call, growth in Windows depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want at the price points they demand, and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse need.  We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals, and we\u2019re confident we are moving in the right direction. Now, switching gears to productivity, this quarter we launched the latest version of Office, which brings mobility, social, and cloud features to the world\u2019s most popular productivity app.  Importantly, the new Office represents a fundamental shift in our model.  Now both businesses and consumers can access Office through subscription. With this shift, we expect to grow our customer base, increase customer satisfaction via continuous updates, and reduce piracy.  As our enterprise customers modernize their productivity infrastructures, we are confident that they will continue to deploy Office 365.  We also expect our transactional customers to increasingly transition to the cloud with Office 365. It\u2019s been a while now that we\u2019ve been talking about our investments in the cloud, and I\u2019m pleased to share that we are starting to realize the benefits of those investments in a meaningful way. Office 365 lights up with this latest release, as evidenced by our growing customer adoption.  This quarter was our strongest ever, with net seat additions up 5 times over the prior year.  One in four of our enterprise customers now has Office 365, and the business is on a $1 billion annual revenue run rate. Our server and tools business continues its momentum with yet another solid quarter of revenue growth.  Within the data platform, we continue to take share, with our strength in mission critical and business intelligence workloads.  Enterprise has recognized the power of SQL Server to unlock business insights, and as a result, we continue to significantly outpace the market and are seeing new deployments and very healthy renewals. In enterprise cloud, just in the last week, we launched our Windows Azure Active Directory and infrastructure as a service offering on Windows Azure.  This innovation across platform and infrastructure services uniquely positions Microsoft as the only cloud provider who can offer customers a comprehensive hybrid cloud solution that integrates existing IT infrastructure with all the benefits of the public cloud. Xbox continues to be at the center of our living room strategy, having evolved from gaming to an entertainment platform.  Whether they are playing games, being social, or watching movies, consumers continue to be drawn to Xbox Live.  Xbox Live now has over 46 million members, up 18% from the prior year.  Clearly there\u2019s a lot of momentum, and with E3 only a couple of months away, we look forward to sharing more shortly. In summary, our diversified portfolio drove solid revenue and earnings per share growth.  We are hard at work here at Microsoft and with our partners to drive Windows 8 adoption forward.  At the same time, we have strong momentum in our enterprise businesses, including our cloud services.  Combined with our unique consumer assets like Xbox Live and Skype, we are well-positioned to deliver on our devices and services strategy. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results in more detail.  I\u2019ll then come back to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Peter.  First, I\u2019m going to review our overall results, and then I\u2019ll move on to the details by business segment.  Our diversified portfolio helped us deliver solid financial growth this quarter.  Revenue was up 8% to $18.8 billion, and operating income increased 5% to $6.7 billion.  Earnings per share grew 8% to $0.65. Foreign exchange had a $180 million, or 1 percentage point, negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $99 million, or 2 percentage point negative impact to net income.  From a geographic perspective, we saw similar growth rates across both developed and emerging markets. Multiyear licensing revenue continued to be strong, growing 16%.  Additionally, unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.1 billion.  And our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion. In the Windows division, revenue was flat this quarter.  Within that, OEM revenue performance was in line with the underlying x86 PC market, which continues to be challenged as the PC market evolves beyond the traditional PC to touch and mobile devices.  This quarter, inventory levels were drawn down as the channel awaits new Windows 8 devices. Non-OEM revenue grew 40% this quarter, driven by sales of Surface and continued double digit growth in volume licensing.  Businesses continue to value the Windows platform, and volume licensing of Windows is on track to deliver almost $4 billion in revenue this year, and nearly three-quarters of enterprise agreements that we signed this year include Windows. Additionally, this quarter we saw continued progress in the transition of Windows XP to Windows 7, and now two-thirds of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. Next, I\u2019ll move on to our server and tools business, where we continue to have good momentum.  Revenue grew 11%, highlighted by multiyear licensing revenue, which grew 20%.  The strength in multiyear licensing reflects the commitment and confidence that our customers have in our products and roadmap. In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets tier one application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter.  Companies such as Domino\u2019s Pizza and Xerox continue to look to Hyper-V and Systems Center to deliver their critical business applications.  Revenue for Systems Center grew 22% and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, has gained four points of market share over the past year. Our momentum in public cloud continues with more innovation, greater customer adoption, and a comprehensive suite of offerings.  Enterprise customers like NBC Sports and 3M continue to choose Windows Azure for their cloud platform needs.  Recently, we launched Windows Azure Active Directory, which is an identity and access management solution designed to support cloud-based line of business applications. Today, over 2.9 million businesses, government bodies, and schools are already enjoying the benefits of Windows Azure Active Directory, using it to manage access to Office 365, Dynamic CRM Online, Windows Intune, and Windows Azure. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16%, and again outpaced the broader market.  Usage of SQL Server for tier one applications continues to grow, based on functionality, reliability, and value.  In addition to our efforts in big data, we are developing in-memory BI technologies built right into SQL Server that achieve breakthrough improvements in transaction processing. Now, I\u2019ll move on to the Microsoft business division, where revenue grew 5%.  Within that, business revenue grew 10%, driven by 16% growth in multiyear licensing.  In January, we launched the new Office for consumers.  The new Office introduces touch, social, and mobile scenarios as well as tight integration with SkyDrive, enabling access to documents from any device. The new Office is also available as a subscription, which benefits customers as they are always using the most modern version of Office.  As Peter stated, we expect the shift to grow our customer base, and we saw strong early adoption of the subscription service. I would like to remind you that with subscription, the revenue is earned ratably over the length of the subscription, rather than at the initial purchase.  All up, consumer revenue was roughly in line with the consumer PC market, influenced by the shift to subscription and strong [attach] gain. In terms of our productivity server offerings, we continue to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync, each growing double digits.  Specifically, Lynch revenue grew over 30% again this quarter, with excitement around the platform continuing to grow.  90 of the Fortune 100 companies are now using Lync, and there are more than 5 million seats of Enterprise Voice deployed. At our Lync 2013 conference in February, we announced that Lync and Skype connectivity for presence, instant messaging, and voice will be available for all Lync users by the end of June.  Connecting these audiences was a key milestone as we deliver on the promise of truly unified communications. Next I\u2019ll move on to the online services division, where revenue grew 18%.  Online advertising revenue was up 22%, driven by another quarter of significant search rate improvement.  Operating performance improved 45% this quarter, driven by revenue growth and continued expense management. In the entertainment and devices division, revenue grew 33%.  Xbox sold 1.3 million consoles and maintained its share position in the soft console market.  Xbox Live continued its strong momentum, and we continuously look for ways to further extend the value of Xbox Live for both our members and content partners. As evidence of the expanding benefits, we saw transactional revenue grow roughly twice as fast as member growth this quarter.  Momentum with Windows Phone continues to build.  The device is now available in a broad range of price points.  We\u2019re receiving great reviews and carrier support continues to grow. We now have over 10% share in several countries, but realize there is still a lot of work ahead to break through in some key markets.  The growing awareness of Windows Phone has sustained innovation from our hardware partners, and we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum. Now I\u2019ll cover the remainder of the income statement.  Cost of goods sold increased 21%, principally driven by Surface, growth in cloud infrastructure, and royalties on Xbox Live content and videogames.  Operating expenses grew 4%, primarily related to product launch marketing.  This quarter, our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, and finally, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Peter for our outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Chris.  For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter, and share some thoughts on fiscal year 2014.  Let me start with the fourth quarter. In the Windows division, similar to this quarter, revenue will continue to reflect sales of Surface and strong volume licensing, while OEM revenue will be impacted by the declining traditional PC market as we work to increase our share in tablets. Within server and tools, product revenue, including transactional and multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division total revenue.  Enterprise services is the remaining 20%.  We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow low double-digits. In the Microsoft business division, multiyear licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division\u2019s total, should grow low double digits.  Excluding the recognition of revenue from the Office upgrade offer, transactional revenue, which is the remaining 40% of the division total, should be in line with the x86 PC market. As a reminder, when updating your Q4 models, we expect to recognize approximately $780 million of revenue related to the Office upgrade offer.  In the online services division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits, reflecting growth in search revenue, partially offset by lower display revenue. Moving on to the entertainment and devices division, we expect revenue to grow mid teens.  For the fourth quarter, we expect COGS to grow mid teens, including Surface.  Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging.  In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset. We are reducing our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses to $30.2 billion to $30.5 billion.  This range excludes the impact of the European Commission fine of $733 million. At the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding the expense related to the European Commission fine, to be 17-20%, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion.  Excluding the impact of the Office upgrade offer, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. Now turning to fiscal 2014, we expect fiscal 2014 operating expenses to be $31.6 billion to $32.2 billion, which represents growth of 4-6% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2013 guidance.  We will continue to prioritize our spending while investing in the significant opportunity that is ahead of us. As we look towards the future, we have a solid foundation of products and services in market, and our leadership team is collectively focused on advancing every one of our businesses.  You can expect to hear more about the specific actions we are taking over the next few months. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris and we\u2019ll take some questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Peter.  We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please just keep to one question.  Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions.]  And our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.  Your line is open, sir.\nMark Moerdler: Thanks for the cloud data.  We\u2019ve been looking for a lot of this, so it\u2019s very helpful.  Let me ask two related parts to that.  Can you give us a sense on the growth metrics in terms of Office 365, which is what you\u2019re starting to give here, in terms of revenue, users, customers, something that we can think about there?  And the second half of it, can you give us a sense in terms of the percentage of Office 365 customers that are net new to Exchange?  I know you\u2019ve given little bits of data on SMB and new SMB customers, but any sense there would be appreciated.\nPeter Klein: On Office 365, the metric that we gave was net seat additions were up 5 times over the prior year, so that gives you some growth metric in addition to the revenue number. To your point on Exchange or more broadly, I would say about other workloads, we\u2019re seeing exactly that dynamic.  So not only are we addressing and reaching new customer segments like SMB, but many of them have never had a productivity server workload before.  Not just Exchange, but others as well.  And even those that had Exchange are now using other workloads, and so we\u2019re seeing most of our customers having more than one workload. So across every dimension in terms of new revenue streams from the service, new customer segments, and new workloads, there\u2019s a lot of new, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth and the opportunity that we\u2019ve been looking for.\nOperator: And our next question is from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.  Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Winslow: You provided a little bit of color on Surface.  Obviously we\u2019re seeing expanding portfolio there.  I just want to get a sense of how this evolving, especially on the distribution side, and how the product is doing versus your expectations.  And then when you start to think about going forward, how would you also expect the product portfolio to evolve, as well as distribution?\nPeter Klein: As I said, we are expanding both the product set and distribution, and that is broadly, all devices, inclusive of Surface.  We are expanding distribution of Surface.  We are now in 22 countries, 70 retailers.  And we\u2019ll continue to look to expand that.  Not only just expanding, but improving the experience.  And that\u2019s true not just for Surface, but for broadly Windows 8 devices.  And so we\u2019ll be investing against that for both Surface and a broader array of Windows 8 devices at multiple price points, including lower price points going forward.\nOperator: Walter Pritchard with Citigroup, your line is open.\nWalter Pritchard: I wonder if you could weigh in.  There\u2019s been a bit of a debate this quarter around what the underlying PC market did.  And I think you see numbers ranging out there from mid single digit declines to a mid teens decline.  I\u2019m just wondering if you could weigh in on that.  In the past you\u2019ve given some sort of range. And then related to that is if you look at the second half, I\u2019m wondering how we should set our expectations around this mid to high end Haswell release from Intel in terms of impact it may have on the PC market versus the later year, more holiday time, lower end Atom release, and how those two chip releases may have an impact on what you\u2019re expecting from the device market and overall impact on Windows?\nPeter Klein: On the PC market, I would look to some of the third parties, IDC and Gartner.  They\u2019re sort of in the 12-13-14 down range this quarter.  And in terms of the chipsets, we\u2019ve always felt that with Windows 8, it was a process of the ecosystem really innovating across the board, and really starting to see that on the chips.  And we\u2019re very encouraged by both Haswell and some of the Atom processors to really improve the overall user experience that Windows 8 delivers.  And over the coming selling season, I think that\u2019s very encouraging and we\u2019re optimistic about that.\nOperator: Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nHeather Bellini: We\u2019ve heard Intel talk about Haswell, and they mentioned it on the call, I think it was last night.  You obviously mentioned it.  And I guess I\u2019m just wondering what can you guys do to specifically help grow your tablet share given you are reliant, ex the Surface products, on OEM partners to really hit a broad segment of the market.  And I\u2019m thinking in general, given the OEM partners don\u2019t have much wiggle room on the margin side, what can you do to help stimulate your market share, in particular in the mobility and in the tablet side?\nPeter Klein: I think broadly, in improving our position in tablets, and generally in devices, there\u2019s five or six dimensions ranging from what we\u2019re doing with OEMs on the devices and the range of devices, and how they can have a range of price points.  What the chips can do, because I think that\u2019s a part of it.  Both first party and third-party apps, and we\u2019ve seen improvements across the board there.  The user interface, and how we\u2019re innovating across the user experience.  And then distribution So if you start sort of from the bottom up, all the way to when you buy the product, we\u2019re working across all those dimensions.  And on the device side, we are working closely with the OEMs to help them take Windows 8 and show it off in all its glory, across different form factors.  I talked about new smaller form factors and how Windows 8 can innovate to improve that experience. So I think the biggest thing we\u2019re doing is helping them develop new and improved user experiences across the board, across size, across price point, and deliver a really compelling Windows 8 experience.  And it\u2019s not just the devices, like I said, it\u2019s chips, it\u2019s the apps, it\u2019s the buying experience, it\u2019s the user interface.  So we\u2019re really focused on all five or six of those dimensions going forward.\nOperator: Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: You mentioned on the call that going to subscription revenues does have a near term impact on your revenues.  I was wondering if you could help us understand whether we\u2019re seeing that impact today, and perhaps to what degree, with the strong uptake of some of the cloud services, particularly like Office 365.\nPeter Klein: We are seeing that, particularly in our transactional business, in MBD, as people move from what may have been a transactional to a perpetual license, where the revenue is recognized up front, to a subscription service, where it\u2019s recognized ratably.  So you\u2019re basically deferring the rest of the term of the subscription.  So in the short term, you\u2019ll be deferring revenues that were not in a subscription, and would have been recognized immediately. And as the subscription business is growing, you\u2019ll see that impact growing, but over time, what you\u2019ll get is what looks like an annuity revenue stream, that\u2019s more predictable and has higher customer satisfaction and probably higher retention rates going forward.  But in the short term, that will impact mostly in the transactional side of the MBD business.\nOperator: Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Peter, just on the gross margin, it\u2019s been under pressure for the last several years, but this quarter it did bounce back.  Can you just give us a sense of how you think gross margins will trend, and do you expect a slow improvement from here or expect more of the same in terms of where they\u2019ve been in the last couple of quarters?\nPeter Klein: Gross margins, as you know, are always going to be a function of mix.  And so depending on where you are in the quarter, the biggest driver of what your gross margin is going to be is mix.  So if you have a big hardware quarter that has low gross margins, that will impact it. The biggest things that are going to impact the mix are going to be hardware, cloud services, and enterprise services, or people services.  It is a fact that we are starting to get scale in our cloud services, and so the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Office 365 is really coming at an improved margin as we scale that out. So within each, we made progress, and then overall, in any given quarter, for the company it\u2019s going to be a function of mix.  So obviously in a holiday quarter, where you sell a bunch of hardware, that will have an impact on gross margin. But I think one of the main takeaways for me is in particularly some of our cloud services, we\u2019re really starting to get scale. Bing continues to improve, their margins.  And Office 365 is really starting to get to scale.  So those things are really encouraging.\nOperator: Ed Maguire with CLSA, your line is open.\nEd Maguire: You just launched your Azure infrastructure as a service.  Just went generally available this week.  And I\u2019d love to get some color on how much that\u2019s figuring in the growth in long term contracts, and what your expectations might be for more traditional infrastructure as a service uptake over the next several quarters.\nPeter Klein: Great question.  It\u2019s clearly a key enabler of our cloud OS story, and how we\u2019re driving what we\u2019re doing with enterprise in the data center.  We have infrastructure as a service, we have now the most complete end-to-end offering through platform, and software, identity, and access. But having the infrastructure is a key enabler, and I think a real accelerator for the Windows Azure strategy, and really more broadly the cloud OS strategy.  We now have a complete end-to-end story through the data center, from private, to hosted, to public, from infrastructure to platform, so I think it\u2019s, again, a key enabler of that [all up] strategy, and an accelerator.\nOperator: John DiFucci with JPMC, your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: My question is for Chris.  Just wanted to clarify something you said about inventories.  I think you were talking about PC inventory.  But with the Windows business, can you give us your assessment of what Windows inventory is at OEMs, especially given the disappointing PC shipment data this quarter?\nChris Suh: I did mention the fact that we believe inventories were drawn down.  We do think they\u2019re at normal levels at this point, though.\nOperator: Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company, your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: In recent periods, we\u2019ve seen your MBD growth significantly outpace PC unit growth, although we now have a dynamic where your Office subscription is really resonating with customers.  So the question is, just looking at it on a directional basis, is MBD revenue outperformance relative to PC units something that you think is sustainable going forward?\nPeter Klein: The answer is that it will depend, and certainly an offset between attach gains we\u2019re making against the market, offset against some deferrals as revenue moves to a subscription.  And so it will kind of depend each quarter.  Long term, it\u2019s a great trend, because we\u2019re building up a banked book of business on the subscription side, which will become less and less connected to the PC market.\nOperator: Raimo Lenschow with Barclays, your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: If you look at IBM coming out earlier on today having a relatively tough quarter given the economy, can you just comment on a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing out there, especially server and tools division obviously doing relatively well, but other guys are really struggling.  So help us understand how you see the economy.\nPeter Klein: I think about the economy, and then I think about the value proposition of our products.  Clearly there are tough spots in the economy.  I think enterprises and CIOs are looking for what they\u2019ve always been looking for, which is how do they get the best value for their dollar to move their businesses forward. And I think we have a very good story in terms of the value that enterprises and small and medium businesses get from the capabilities that they can get from us, particularly in the data center, with SQL.  And as you compare SQL Server to competing products, the performance that you get relative to the price is really a compelling value proposition, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been enabling us to take share.  The same on virtualization as well. And so I think for us, it\u2019s a combination of having the most complete roadmap for getting to the cloud, as well as the best collection of products that have price performance characteristics that are attractive to CIOs that are allowing us to have growth in our enterprise business, particularly in server and tools.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.  Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Peter, as you look at the PC data over the course of the quarter, can you give us any sense of how that trended?  And following up on that, as you think about the business upgrade cycle, which should be over by this time next year, do we risk a real fall off again in the PC business, because the upgrade cycle has aided what\u2019s been a difficult PC market the last couple of quarters?\nPeter Klein: On your first question, there wasn\u2019t anything abnormal in terms of the trends during the quarter.  On your second question, the upgrade cycle, particularly for businesses, will be interesting over the next year.  I think over the longer term, what\u2019s more interesting is the long term evolution we\u2019re seeing in the device market, which I think is actually going to be more of a driver than any temporal upgrade cycle.  Innovation is happening faster, people are getting new experiences and new form factors. I think that\u2019s what Windows 8 was designed to take advantage of, and so I think about the opportunity more about the new capabilities and the new services, and the experience that people can get on their devices and different kinds of devices, than it is about an upgrade cycle that\u2019s driven by something else.\nChris Suh: So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call.  We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at events such as E3, TechEd, and Build, as well as at various investor conferences.  For those of you unable to attend in person, these events will generally be webcast, and you will be able to follow our comments at Microsoft.com/investor.  Please contact us if you need additional details.  Thanks again for joining us today, and take care."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 2, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-01-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Microsoft's fiscal year 2013 second quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin.\nChris Suh: Thanks, operator and thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. This does feel like a bit of a homecoming. Some of you may remember, I was in IR a number of years ago. I am excited to be back and looking forward to working with all of you. With me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer, Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, is our financial summary slide deck which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until January 24, 2014. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, protection or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factor section of our Form 10K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to remind you all that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferral and recognition related to Windows, Office and Xbox videogame and the details of those adjustments can be found in our financial summary slide deck and press release. With that I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks everyone for joining us. I am pleased to welcome Chris as the new head of investor relations. Chris has been with Microsoft for over 16 years and has been in diverse finance role which gives him a good background for this role. I also want to thank Bill for all he has accomplished over the past four years and congratulate him on his new role as the CFO of the Skype division. This quarter we had record revenue of $22 billion and record earnings per share of $0.81. It has been an exciting quarter with the launch of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. In the enterprise, we continue to see solid demand for our business products and services with particularly strong growth in multiyear licensing. Multiyear licensing revenue benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform. Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services enable CIOs to build efficient infrastructure, unlock business insight, improve productivity and support bring your own device. In the data center, recent releases of Windows Server 2012 and System Center 2012 are driving customer wins and strong renewals. Our cloud OS roadmap uniquely positions us to support the hybrid infrastructure needs of CIOs by providing one consistent platform that can span their own data center, our partners data center, or Windows Azure with ultimate flexibility, portability and scale. On the data platform, we are growing our revenue share as enterprises continue to move mission-critical workloads to SQL Server and deploy it for their business intelligence solutions. In productivity, we are excited about the upcoming launch of the new Office, and how it redefines user experience with mobility, social and cloud features. The new Office features a fast fluid design that takes full advantage of the new Windows interface. With Skype and Yammer integration it unlocks new experiences for communication and collaboration and brings social directly into productivity scenarios. With Windows 8, businesses will now be able to give their employees thin and light devices without compromising on security or manageability. Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continues and today, over 60% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7. We've talked about Windows 8 as Windows re-imagined from the chipset to the user experience. As we undergo this transformation, it is important for us to bring the entire ecosystem along with us. With the launch in October, we collectively took the first of many steps changing the way people use technology at work and in play. Since then, the number of Windows 8 certified systems has nearly doubled. The number of apps in the Windows store has quadrupled and Windows users have downloaded over 100 million apps. To-date, we have sold over 60 million licenses of Windows 8. Our partners, including OEM hardware manufacturers, app developers and retailers have worked hard to get us to where we are today. It\u2019s early days and an ambitious endeavor like takes time. Together with our partners, we remain focused on fully delivering the promise of Windows 8. As part of our work to advance the ecosystem, we launched Surface Windows RT last quarter. Surface is one part of the overall Windows 8 story. With tight integration across hardware and software, Surface highlights the unique innovation enabled by Windows 8, we launched it exclusively in our stores and in select geography and are expanding our retail and geographic footprint. As we look forward, we strive to deliver seamless experiences across hardware, software and services. Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Xbox 360, provide a similar look and feel to users. This consistency complemented with our cloud services like Bing, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE and SmartGlass unifies the consumer experience. In the Enterprise, we continue to design and deliver world-class cloud solutions that allow our customers to move to the cloud on their own terms. The compelling experiences we deliver across our devices and services as well as our large partnering customer base uniquely positions us for sustained future growth. In summary, this quarter strength of our product portfolio delivered record revenue and earnings per share. As we enter calendar year 2013, there is tremendous opportunity for our partners, developers and customers to leverage the capabilities and scenarios our significant product releases have enabled. With that, I am going to hand it back to Chris to provide more details on our results.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Peter. First, I am going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the detail by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was up 5% to $22 billion. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 4% and earnings per share was $0.81, also up 4%. Foreign exchange had a $200 million, or one percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and $154 million, or two percentage point negative impact to net income. From a geographic perspective, we saw growth return in developed markets and saw mid-teens growth in emerging markets. Bookings were strong growing 11% as we're continuing to see customers making long-term commitments to our products. You see the results in the following metrics. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 15%. Unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.4 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion. Moving to Windows. This quarter total revenue grew 11%. Within that OEM revenue outperformed underlying x86 PC market, reflecting increased demand in our distribution channel. While inventory levels ended the quarter at slightly higher levels than the prior year, we believe them to be in a healthy range given the recent launch. Non-OEM revenue grew over 40% driven by Windows 8 upgrade, sales of Surface and double-digit growth in volume licensing. Within the x86 PC market, we saw similar trends to prior quarters with emerging market outperforming developed markets and business outperforming consumer. The Consumer segment was the most impacted by the ecosystem transition as demand exceed the limited assortment of touch devices available. Next, I'll walk through our server and tools business, which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth. Product revenue grew 9%, and within that multi-year licensing revenue grew 17%. On the strength of both, new and existing customer bookings grew a solid 15%. For the modern data center, we continue to be on the forefront of the innovation with our Cloud OS roadmap, which provides a flexible platform for CIOs to manage their infrastructure, applications and data. With the launch of Windows Server 2012 in September, we delivered a cloud-optimized operating system and have continued to gain share in virtualization. To further strengthen our cloud OS platform, we have introduced steady stream of innovation in Windows Azure, including virtual machines, media services, website services and mobile services. Our management product, System Center continued its momentum and delivered 18% revenue growth. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% driven by strength in SQL Server premium. Revenue growth continues to outpace the market as customers increasingly use SQL Server for their mission-critical application and business intelligence needs, making it the most pervasive data platform. On the BI side, we are delivering on our strategy to enable analysis of all types of data while also accelerating time to insight. We are powering organizations to realize the power of big data as Hadoop is now compatible on Windows Server and Windows Azure. With SQL Server 2012, we took the next step forward in advancing in-memory capabilities and see tremendous opportunities ahead. Now I will move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Consumer revenue declined 2% with x86 PC market dynamics being partially offset by gains in attach. Businesses are choosing Microsoft as their productivity platform for the future. This is evidenced by the healthy 18% bookings growth and near historical high renewal rates for Office. Business revenue grew 4%, and within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 10%. Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well, and again this quarter, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of 35%, as customers continue to be drawn to both the enhanced productivity that it enables, and also the economic benefits of our solution. Next, I will move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 11%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven by significant search rate improvements, offset in part by a decline in display revenue. With revenue growth, and ongoing expense management, we delivered another quarter of operating performance improvement. In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 2%. In the important holiday season, Xbox continued its leadership position in the U.S. console market. Halo 4 launched in November, and has already become the best-selling title of the critically acclaimed gaming franchise. We did defer $380 million this quarter for games where the buyer has rights to receive content in the future. The video game deferral was included in the Q2 guidance, and we expect it to be recognized in Q3. We also continued to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE, further solidifying Xbox LIVE as the premier entertainment service in the family room. Windows Phone saw strong growth in both phone and patent licensing revenue. In November, we launched Windows Phone 8, with our strongest lineup of both carriers and devices. Windows Phone sales were over four times higher than they were last year and at CES this year more partners were announced, as the Windows Phone ecosystem continues to grow. Skype had 138 billion minutes of calls on its network this quarter, which was up 59%. Now I will cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, due to the full quarter of Nokia platform payments, Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure, partially offset by declines in Xbox consoles. Operating expenses grew 10% to $8 billion, primarily related to marketing for product launches. This quarter, our tax rate was approximately 18%. Finally, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders in buyback and dividends. Now I will turn the call back over to Peter for our outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Chris. Through the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Looking ahead with Windows, we know that our growth depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want, at the price-points they demand and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse needs. We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals. One of our biggest partners, Intel, not only delivered the Clover Trail chip this year, they have said they will deliver their next generation chip, Haswell, in 2013, which will enable even more advances in the device market. This is just one example of the innovation we are seeing from our chip partners. We also need to continue to work with our hardware partners as they create thin and lightweight devices on both x86 and ARM chipsets that offer compelling touch experiences that bring Windows 8 to life. You have started to see the next wave of Windows devices at CES, and collectively we will work to ensure that we have the most compelling devices and the right mix of devices in the marketplace. During the quarter, we launched the first device in our Surface family of products. We recently increased production and expanded distribution to third-party retail partners. Next month, we will make Surface Windows RT available in 14 additional countries. At the same time, we will also launch Surface Windows 8 Pro, which provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package. With the broadening of the Surface lineup, we will continue to highlight the power of Windows 8 tightly integrated with fantastic hardware. On the app front, we are deepening our engagement with developers. While the number of apps in the Windows Store has quadrupled since launch, we clearly have more work to do. We need more rich, immersive apps that give users access to content that informs, entertains and inspires. While there is a lot of work ahead of us, we are incredibly excited by the opportunities to both, broaden and enrich the Windows ecosystem. With the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT, we are positioned for growth across a massive addressable market from tablets to laptops and Ultrabooks to all-in-ones. We will continue to work closely with our partners through this transformation as we collectively re-imagine Windows. As you update your models remember that the Windows Upgrade Offer expires at the end of February. At that time, we will recognize $1.1 billion, which is all of the remaining deferred revenue related to the Upgrade Offer. Within Server and Tools, product revenue, including transactional and multi-year licensing, is about 80% of the division's total revenue and enterprise services is the remaining 20%. We expect product revenue to grow low teens for the third quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect enterprise services to grow mid-teens for the third quarter and the full fiscal year. In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits for both, the third quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should outperform the x86 PC market in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year. As a reminder, when updating your Q3 models, we expect to recognize between $250 and $300 million of revenue related to pre-sales into the channel and the Office Offer. We expect most of the remainder of the deferral to be recognized at the expiration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the second quarter with search revenue growth partially offset by lower display revenue. Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices Division, in the third quarter we expect to recognize $380 million related to the video game deferral. Excluding recognition of deferrals, we expect revenue to grow high teens in the third quarter and low-single digits for the full fiscal year. Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company, COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen in the past few quarters. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect COGS to grow high single-digits for the full fiscal year. We are reaffirming our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset one another for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate to be 17% to 20% for the full fiscal year, and we expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion for the full fiscal year. For the third quarter, excluding the impact of deferrals, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the second quarter. We have good product momentum in the market and are excited about the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris and we\u2019ll take some questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question and avoid long and multi-part question. Operator, please go ahead and repeat the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.\nPhilip Winslow: Thank, guys and congrats on a good quarter in a pretty tough macro environment. Just wanted to spend a moment on Surface. You obviously talked about ramping up production and distribution of that. Just what are some of your goals as you look at Surface, RT and Pro for this year? Within that context, how should we think about the profitability of the Surface? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: Thank, Phil. As we said, we think of Surface as one part of the overall Windows 8 story. Certainly this quarter it was a contributing factor to the revenue growth in Windows Business. What it does is it highlights some interesting innovation that can happen to demonstrate the power of Windows 8 when tightly integrated hardware and software and new categories of devices, and where, obviously we had some limited distribution this quarter in our stores. As you know, we are excited about expanding that. So our goal is to continue to build that business to highlight the incredible power of Windows 8 in an interesting set of devices. We are going to expand geographically. We are going to expand the product line up. We are going to expand retail distribution and capacity. So we look forward to continuing the growth of that business.\nChris Suh: Thanks, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Sir, your line is open.\nWalter Pritchard: Just wondering, Peter, if you could talk about, obviously, one of the big differences here between your devices and market and some of the competing devices I think is price point of touch machines, Windows devices, are much higher. I am wondering if you could just talk about what you learned here in the first three or four months of the Windows launch? How important price is to the customer base in terms of driving units? What do you think the outlook is in terms of getting price points down on the devices in aggregate in order to potentially drive some demand?\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Walter. We have learned a lot this quarter. We learned a lot about the types of experiences and scenarios and to some extent the price points the customers are looking for from their devices. We saw some really great demand for some of the touch devices that we brought to market. In some cases, we didn\u2019t have the supply that we needed to satisfy that demand. From a price point, we learned what we have always suspected, which is this segmentation and differentiation. There is one of the powers in the Windows ecosystem, obviously, is the variety of devices and form factors and experiences at a variety of price points. We learned that that continues to be important. As I said, we are working very closely with both our chip partners as well as the OEMs to bring the right mix of devices which means, to your point, the right set of touch devices at the right price point depending on the unique needs of the individual. We learned a lot about that and one of things you will see is a greater variety of devices at a bigger variety of price points that meet the differentiated needs of our consumers.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Walter. We will take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open.\nRick Sherlund: Thank you, and Chris, welcome back to IR.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Rick.\nRick Sherlund: MBD, I just want clarification because the revenue growth is a little slower than I would have thought but it looks like what we are seeing is a transition in the business. It looks like in business transactional, it is more multiyear licensing and the bookings growth would suggest that that business is changing to be more revenue over time versus upfront. Just want a clarification if I am thinking about that correctly.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Rick. You are thinking about that absolutely correctly. We have seen big increases in multiyear annuity business. Bookings growth was very strong. So you are seeing that transition to long-term commitment to the business. Secondarily, this quarter obviously in a prelaunch quarter, cyclically you tend to see a slowdown in transactional business as well but that was secondary to this longer-term trend of transition to the multiyear commitment.\nChris Suh: Okay, thanks, Rick. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.\nAdam Holt: Great, thank you. Sorry to ask a model question. My question is about cash flow and I guess two factors around cash flow. Could you just drill in a little bit into the delta between bookings growth and billings growth in the quarter? Then could you also just touch on the inventory in the quarter? It looked like it was a little above what it normally is. Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Well, as always there's sort of difference between bookings growth and billings growth is going to be function of the mix of long-term agreements, right? Because, our multi-year licensing agreements are three-year agreements and so bookings will include all of that revenue from the agreements and then typically those are billed a year a time, so the billings growth sort of that one-year of billings. And, so to the extent we see this sort of growth in the multi-year licensing business, you are going to see a buildup of bookings growth is going to be fast. You are going to see a buildup of deferred revenue now move in sort of into billings and then recognition for the income statement over time. And, so to the extent we continue to see transition to long-term commitment, you will expect to see that trend continue. Your second question was on inventory, when you say inventory, you mean on the balance sheet?\nAdam Holt: Yes.\nPeter Klein: Yes. The inventory is a function of both, what's happening in the Xbox business and Surface. They are sort of offsetting impact this quarter. Some of it is from Surface and then some of it is from the Xbox business.\nAdam Holt: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeather Bellini: Great. I had a question about, Peter, you mentioned the renewal rates in MBD continue. I guess, they are at a record and continue to move higher. I am just wondering if you could share with us what's driving the increase in the renewal rates and how much runway do you have left there. Then actually I had a follow-on Adam's question about inventory, because usually it goes down in the December quarter. Obviously, you have Surface now, so it jumped up, but did we see the traditional Xbox work down of inventory that we normally see? So, should we be looking at the fact that the delta between the drawdown that you normally see and the fact I think it went up or was roughly flat this quarter was the result of Surface?\nPeter Klein: Okay. I'll start with your first question, which was MBD renewal rate, you know, I think it's a combination of things. Heather as you know over time, we've been broadening the notion of how we think about productivity and so I think it's a combination of a couple of things. One is, just the product set, Lync is a big driver, SharePoint, Exchange, so the connection between the collaboration and communications' technology and the enhancements to just the productivity applications themselves, I think Office 365 and the roadmap to the cloud is really exciting to customers and part of the reason they are making the long-term commitment to MBD and to the Office and related products, is because our roadmap to the cloud really resonates with them in how they get there over time and how that works. I think also, our roadmap from a capability perspective and what's coming in the new Office, with social, again, advances in the cloud is really driving sort of a roadmap that's compelling to customers and so that's why they are making long-term commitments to the platform, so that's great to see. In inventory, yes, you are thinking about it right. I think we saw the normal sort of drawdown from the Xbox business in any offsetting increase there was related to Surface.\nOperator: Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much and happy New Year. It's already quite a bit into the year, but what I was wondering was in the holiday season post a launch for Microsoft typically we get a big effect to the PC industry. It's happened every cycle, and I guess we had some competition from tablets and we didn't quite see that kind of whiz-bang effect with a typical Windows launch. I am curious to get your take on what is it that the media and the industry seems to have gotten it wrong? What are the misperceptions about Windows 8, and how do you think the year is going to play out as far as Windows 8 receptivity in the consumer market and business market.\nPeter Klein: Yes. Thanks, Kash. Windows, as I talked about, Windows 8 is a sort of big, bold, re-imagining of Windows across the whole ecosystem, and I think this was the start of that process. I think, we all collectively learned a lot about from the user interface to the touch devices. And, as I tried to give context on the call, there's a lot of things we are working on with our partners that I think to continue to drive this process forward over the next several quarters whether it's the chipset, whether it's with developers or the kinds of applications that people want and certainly for the kinds of touch devices that they write price points that consumers want I think all of that continuously improving, we are continuously learning and happens over time, but this is a big ambitious re-imagining of Windows, and this quarter was the first step in that process.\nKash Rangan: Got it. So, the traction, the ramp should get better over time and so we should not be judging the cycle for the December quarter necessarily.\nPeter Klein: I highlighted the things that drive that exactly.\nKash Rangan: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Next question, please.\nOperator: Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Peter, just on the gross margins, they have been under pressure the last several years. There is a lot of components that go in that you get to see but certainly we don\u2019t get to see. Can you give us just the puts and takes of perhaps, is there any change later in the year, when you start to see some of the components of the COG, the expenses start to come off, or not?\nPeter Klein: Well, COGS is always going to be a function of the mix of the types of revenue and so its really depend on what your underlying assumptions are about the differing components of the revenue, whether that\u2019s hardware related revenue in Xbox and now in Surface, whether its multiyear licensing business in enterprises and what online services. So at any point in time, it's really going to depend on that mix of revenue, which is just going to cycle over time. So we try to give you some sense for the rest of the year how we see that playing out in total at Microsoft and again that\u2019s going to be a function of the mix we see between the various components.\nChris Suh: And tend to reiterate in Peter's guidance, excluding Surface. I think Peter just high-single digits COGS for (inaudible) Surface.\nPeter Klein: That\u2019s right.\nChris Suh: Thank very much. Next question, please.\nOperator: John DiFucci with JPMC, your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Peter, you said that the Windows OEM revenue outperformed the x86 PC market and your comments imply some Windows inventory build into the channel which I believe you normally see during a quarter with a Windows launch as OEMs build inventory in preparation for the launch. Would it be accurate to assume that the Windows outperformance was primarily relative to the PC market? Was it primarily due to the inventory build or was there something else there happening? Was there anything else used to give us that bridge which you haven\u2019t for a while now, but I just wondered if any of those other factors had a big influence?\nPeter Klein: Yes, the three biggest components of the 11% total revenue growth, that 11% adjusted for the recognition of the deferrals, in the Windows business were the retail upgrades, the sales of the Surface and then multiyear licensing agreements within enterprises. To your point, there was some tailwind from inventory which was normally as you highlight what we see in the launch quarter and as Chris said, it's within the healthy range that we typically see. But that was some tailwind. But the three big impacts all up on the Windows revenue were the retail upgrades, sales of Surface and the enterprise annuity business which continues to grow double-digit.\nJohn DiFucci: Any detection of any piracy effects or changes?\nPeter Klein: We are going to run the same long-term trend on piracy that we have always been. I wouldn't highlight anything specific to this quarter, but as always we are fighting piracy across all the dimensions and the long-term trend should be good, but that will cycle up and down in any given quarter.\nChris Suh: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Colin Gillis with BGC Financials, your line is open.\nColin Gillis: Hi, Peter, the trend in OSD in terms of the smaller losses. Is that a run rate that we can think about going into the March quarter? Also when you talked about the improvement in revenue per search, is there any more color or quantification you can put around that?\nPeter Klein: On the first question, the guidance we gave on the revenue, we continue to work hard on the cost structure, but certainly as we highlighted the dynamics on revenue will be relatively consistent to what you see this quarter. In terms of the monetization, it's what we have been very focused on here. Part of it is the work we have done with our partnership with Yahoo. Part of it's the quality of the searches that we have been doing. It's the realization of all the work we have been doing on both the search engine as well as the app platform to make sure it's finally tuned to deliver the best economic result and that's what we been talking about this for, gosh, a year and a half, two years. We have been really focused on that with our best talent and you start to see that paying off and that's what's driving the monetization.\nChris Suh: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities, your line is open.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks so much. Peter, you highlighted the market share gains you guys are seeing in SQL Server and specifically you talked about BI and mission-critical applications. I was just wondering if you could give us any more color on the use cases and applications where you guys are particularly seeing the biggest gains and any impact that pricing maybe having on that. Thanks.\nPeter Klein: The biggest impact is the capabilities that we have delivered with SQL Server 2012. In terms of the use cases, there is couple of things that fall into those buckets of mission-critical and BI. In terms of mission-critical, we are seeing large enterprise customers re-platform on SQL for any number of things, underneath their ERP, underneath what are the major sort of LOB apps they have that sort of drive their business and that's really an emerging trend with 2012 and what that does. That's really advance and I would add that that's been one of the drivers of our transition to multi-year licensing, because now we're seeing customers commit more and more to SQL as part of their multi-year enterprise agreements as well. On BI side, the combination of SQL as well as SharePoint and Excel is really compelling to customers in terms of the business insights they can generate from their line of business application systems, and I think really the combination of the types what you see frontend on Excel, on top of the SQL database is really good of a driver for both businesses frankly and that's a lot of what's driving the multi-year licensing business up about MBD and FTB.\nOperator: Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you. You had mentioned that over 60% of enterprise desktops now are running on Windows 7, looking forward how do you expect the cadence of migration activity to unfold from now until the termination of XP support in early to mid-2014. Does it continue at a similar pace for a while and at what point do we probably see this moderate?\nPeter Klein: Well, the one thing I would say is not only over 60% of Windows 7, but about 90% have expressed, they have a plan to do that and so I expect to see sort of steady drumbeat between now and end-of-life for XP support in April 2014 for that to continue because the incentive is there and the express desire to do that has been expressed by our customers, so I would expect to see that continue over the next year, year-and-a-quarter.\nChris Suh: Operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow-on, on that one. You had one quarter Windows 8 now. What was the feedback that you had from the enterprise so far? I mean, obviously, they are still in the middle of the Windows 7 upgrade as well, but what's the point that they liked about Windows 8?\nPeter Klein: Yes. There's a couple of things. They like the ability to get thin lightweight devices with the kind of security and manageability that they are used to manage their business and also there's early interest in new applications being developed with the Windows 8 interface which is a new way for their users to interact with their business applications, so I think you will see those two things are early information in driving the business interest in Windows 8.\nChris Suh: Final question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Last question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Sir, your line is open.\nEd Maguire: Thank you. Good evening. I wanted to follow-up on Rick's question about the transition from the transactional to a multi-year deal. How much --\nChris Suh: I think we lost the question.\nOperator: I am sorry. Mr. Maguire, (Operator Instructions). Mr. Maguire, your line is open.\nEd Maguire: Thank you. How much of your. Just going back to Rick's question, regarding the transition of transactional to multi-year revenues, what in your business reflects the transition in purchasing of on-premise to hosted or cloud offering like from Office to Office 365 or Server to Azure and other similar transitions?\nPeter Klein: Well, a cloud purchase will sort of mirror multi-year annuity pressures. It's a very similar way to accomplish the same thing. You are making a long-term commitment, the revenue is going to be recognized in a similar fashion. Today, we see a hybrid where customers are buying multi-year enterprise agreements. They'll also add-on some cloud services with that, but it will manifest itself in our financial results in a very similar way.\nChris Suh: Okay. So, that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous events and conferences, which we'll be participating in this quarter. For those of you unable to attend in person, these events will generally webcast and you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Okay. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Klein: Thanks Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. Our first quarter revenue was flat year-over-year at $17.4 billion reflecting solid growth in multiyear licensing, but a slowdown in transactional revenue. Our transactional revenue which includes our OEM business was impacted by a challenging PC market, normal purchasing slowdowns in advance of upcoming product launches and tough economic conditions, particularly in Europe. This impact was offset by growth in multiyear licensing revenue which benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform. Our productivity and infrastructure offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. In productivity, our collaboration and communications solutions continue to perform well, with double-digit revenue growth this quarter. In the datacenter, our virtualization capabilities and hybrid cloud scenarios are enabling enterprises to move to the modern datacenter on their terms. And on the data platform, we are well positioned to take share, as customers increasingly turn to SQL Server 2012 for their mission critical workloads and business intelligence needs. As part of our ongoing focus to increase the overall value we bring to our customers, we are enhancing our unique hybrid IT capabilities, with targeted acquisitions like StorSimple and PhoneFactor. Acquisitions of industry leading solutions like these accelerate our ability to help CIOs better manage their environment. As I mentioned earlier, the PC market was challenged this quarter. In addition to a tough economic environment and competitive pressures, OEMs drew down their Windows 7 inventory as they began the transition to Windows 8. Our partners are building an incredible breadth of hardware. To-date, we have certified over 1,000 unique Windows 8 systems, including beautiful new tablets, convertibles, laptops and all-in-ones and there will be more to come. As I look at where we are, we have kicked off the largest launch wave in our history and in a 12-month period, we will have refreshed nearly all of our major products. With these launches, you are seeing the investments we\u2019ve made over a number of years converge. And more importantly, you\u2019re seeing us execute on our commitment to deliver devices and services that people love and businesses need. Whether we build our own devices as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Service or work with our partners to develop stunning new Windows devices. We will continue to offer consumers and businesses wide ranging choices, so that every user can get exactly what they want at the price that is right for them. With Windows 8 and our cloud services, we will delight users with an integrated experience across their devices. Right out of the box, Windows customers will be connected to unique communications, productivity and entertainment services from both Microsoft and our partners. Services like SkyDrive, which allows users to store and manage their data online or the recently announced Xbox Music, which brings entertainment to the forefront. Users can access their content seamlessly from any device, at any time. With the new Office which will be made available in the coming months, we will enable productivity scenarios to take the full advantage of the hardware coming to market. Including new mobile phone factors with touch and pen capabilities. And with Skype, Yammer and other services we put social directly into productivity and collaboration. Within the enterprise, CIOs are using technology to drive their business strategy forward; whether it\u2019s making employees more productive, unlocking key business insights or managing and growing number of devices, we are uniquely positioned to address their needs. Our products are scalable and flexible and provide the lowest total cost of ownership. As we enter this new era at Microsoft, there is incredible opportunity for our partners, developers and customers and we are well positioned for sustained profit growth in the future. With those thoughts, I hand it back to Bill for more details on our results. And then I will come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. First I am going to review our overall results and then I will move on to the details by business segments. Revenue for the quarter was flat at $17.4 billion. Operating income was $6.7 billion, down 7%. Earnings per share was $0.65, a decline of 4%. Cash flow from operations was roughly flat at $8.5 billion. Foreign exchange had a $257 million or 2 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter, but the impact to net income was immaterial. From a geographic perspective, this quarter we saw tough conditions in Europe where revenue declined mid-single digits. In emerging markets, PCs were roughly flat, a significant deceleration from the growth rates we had been seeing previously. Our Enterprise business in emerging markets continued double-digit revenue growth. When looking at our revenue mix, consumer and business transactional revenue declined which is typical ahead of launches. Multiyear licensing revenue remained strong with 15% growth representing roughly 45% of our total revenue for the quarter. When adjusted for the $1.9 billion cumulative impact of the Windows and Office revenue deferrals, unearned revenue was $17.7 billion, up 13%. Our contracted-not-billed balance was roughly $20 billion. Now let\u2019s move onto the PC market. We saw the overall PC market decline this quarter in advance to the launch of Windows 8 and in part due to competitive pressures and the challenging macroeconomic climate, I noted earlier. Business outperformed consumer and emerging markets outpaced developed markets although at a reduced rate. Moving to the results for the Windows division, revenue declined 9% and lagged the PC market due to OEM inventory drawdown prior to the Windows 8 launch and the ASP dynamics of emerging markets relative to develop markets. We have discontinued the bridge to the PC market as Windows 8 will be a platform across a broad set a form factors. As we go forward we will provide updated information and metrics about our business performance in the new context. The shape of Windows revenue this quarter was non-linear as revenue slowed down dramatically in the first two months driven by the weak PC market dynamics. Revenue accelerated in September as OEMs started to build out for Windows 8 launch demand. Windows 8 OEM presales revenue was roughly $800 million approximately 40% higher than Windows 7 presales revenue in the comparable launch quarter. This quarter volume licensing revenue grew double-digits and our Windows 7 enterprise deployments continue to grow though at a slower rate than last quarter. On Tuesday, we announced pricing, market availability and open to pre-orders for Surface. Next week on October 26th, we will launch Windows 8 and Surface. With a modern user interface ability to support multiple form factors and a rich platform to build apps, Windows 8 opens up significant opportunities for partners, developers and customers. Now I will move on to the Microsoft Business divisions where revenue grew 1%. Business revenue grew 3% and within that multiyear licensing revenue grew 8%. Reflecting the PC market dynamics, consumer revenue declined 8%. Last week we released the manufacturing of the new office and announced that it will be generally available in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. The new office has a fresh look and touch-friendly interface that lights up on Windows 8 devices. Since the customer preview in July millions of people have downloaded the preview or signed up for this service and we feel great about the feedback and positive response from users. The new office is also in the cloud and features social enterprise capabilities with SharePoint, [EMET] and Skype. It is our most comprehensive office release ever. Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well; Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively grew double-digit again this quarter. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of over 40% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform for their communication and collaboration needs. Dynamics revenue grew mid single-digit and within that Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. This quarter we announced key milestones to our ERP portfolio, with updates to Dynamic GP and NAV. Both these releases delivered great value to customers and partners through faster and more efficient implementations and compelling application functionality. Now let's move to Server and Tools which posted another solid quarter with over 20% bookings growth and 8% revenue growth. Enterprises services grew 13% and multiyear licensing revenue grew 19%, driven by new customers who are investing in our product wave. Transactional revenue declined this quarter, driven in part by a slower server hardware market and customers switching to multiyear licensing. In the datacenter, we're seeing strong adoption of our platform across Cloud, on premise and hybrid scenarios. System Center revenue grew more than 20% and we launched the Windows Server 2012 in September, with increased management and virtualization capabilities. Customers like Acer, AQUAPAX, and Volkswagen Financial Services are already using its robust set of technology and features including network virtualization, flight migration and continuous availability. We continue to gain virtualization share as customers like [POVA] and the City of Barcelona switch from VMware to Hyper-V at System Center to build private clouds with increased efficiencies and higher savings. In the public cloud, we continued the pace innovation and announced the release preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services which connects Windows 8 apps to the cloud, backend hosted in Windows Azure. As Peter mentioned, over the past few weeks, we announced the acquisition of StorSimple and PhoneFactor, which will enhance our position in data storage and device management. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenues continue to grow double-digit. SQL Server premium revenue grew more than 20%, as customers continue to deploy it for their mission-critical workloads and business intelligence needs. By combining the power of SQL Server, SharePoint and Office, CIOs can create scalable, self-service BI platforms. Users can leverage these platforms to analyze and interact with data in bold new ways, make real time decisions and gain insights from big data. We\u2019re seeing how SQL Server 2012 has raised the bar and positioned us to grow faster than the competition. Next, I will move on to the Online Services division where revenue grew 9%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven primarily by rate improvement in search offset in part by a decline in display revenue. Operating performance improved by [$150 million] or 29%. Increasingly, users are finding better search results at Bing. In (inaudible) test, nearly two and three users chose Bing\u2019s web search results over Google\u2019s results and over 10 million users had visited the Bing It On Challenge, where they can compare Bing and Google head-on. In the Entertainment & Devices division, revenue declined 1%. While the console market was tough, Xbox maintained a strong share and had 49% at the US market for the quarter. This holiday season we have a great lineup of gains headlined by Forza Horizon and Halo 4, and complimented by a rich catalogue of connect games. We continue to see strengthening Xbox LIVE, where our membership grew over 15%. This week we announced Xbox Music, which leverages the cloud to integrate the music experience across the tablet, PC, phone and TV, and has a worldwide catalogue of over 30 million songs. Xbox Music is the most comprehensive service available. It provides users unlimited streaming music on Windows devices, let\u2019s them play music based on similar artists and styles and allows them to purchase songs and albums. There is no other music service out there today that matches the capabilities of Xbox Music. We are excited about the upcoming launch of Windows Phone8. We have a strong device line up and breadth of operators across key markets. We will share more about Windows Phone8 at our event on October 29. Moving on to Skype. This quarter 120 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of 58%. We continue to make progress with the integration of Skype into our portfolio of products, and have announced the upcoming federation between Lync and Skype which will allows users to access their contacts through a common interface. Skype is also central to communications in the new Office and Skype calling is included in the upcoming Office 365 subscription service. I will now cover the remainder of the income statements and share some expectations going forward. Cost of goods sold increased 10%, primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs, growth in cloud infrastructure and enterprise services. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect cogs to grow high single-digits for the full fiscal year. Operating expenses grew 2% to $6.5 billion. For the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses as $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. Other income in this quarter was $226 million driven by the gain from the MSNBC sale. Other income includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset for the remainder of the year. This quarter our tax rate was approximately 19%. For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows upgrade and Office offers, we expect other revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern for the second quarter. We expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be roughly $3.5 billion. This quarter we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders and buyback and dividend and raised the dividend 15% to $0.92 per share annually. Now I will turn it back to Peter for our revenue outlook.\nPeter Klein: Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our revenue expectations for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Starting with Server & Tools, product revenue including transaction and multiyear licensing is about 80% of the division\u2019s total revenue, and enterprise services is the remaining 20%. As we noted the last quarter, our customers are moving from transactional purchasing to premium products and multiyear licensing agreements. We expect product revenue to grow high single-digits for the second quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect enterprise services revenue to grow low double-digits for the second quarter and mid-teen for the full fiscal year. In Microsoft business division multiyear licensing revenue which is approximately 60% of the divisions total should grow low double-digits for both the second quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transaction revenue which is the remaining revenue in the division, should grow low single-digits in the second quarter and mid single-digits for the full fiscal year. As a reminder, when updating your Q2 models, you should defer between $850 million and $950 million of revenue related to presales into the channel and the Office offer. Amounts deferred for presales will be recognized upon general availability, while amounts deferred to the Office offer will be recognized upon delivery, redemption or the exploration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Moving on to Entertainment and Devices division, while we have been maintaining our share and leadership position, the console market continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect revenue to decline low teens into second quarter, but to grow low single-digits with the full fiscal year. In the Online Services division, we look to build upon our improvements in share and search monetization. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the first quarter. In the Windows division, as a reminder, second quarter growth will reflect the recognition of $800 million of revenue from first quarter presale, partially offset by roughly $100 million of additional deferred revenue related to the Windows upgrade offer. Remember that the upgrade offer expires at the end of February at which time we will recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Looking forward, we eagerly anticipate the launch of Windows 8. We are bringing a new range of capabilities and scenarios to Windows and with support system-on-chip architecture we are moving beyond the traditional PC to the widest range of Windows hardware we have ever seen. New hardware will debut next week and will broaden over the coming months. With Windows 8, we are giving developers a modern platform on which they can build rich immersive apps unlike any of the Windows ecosystem have seen. The Windows Store offers developers attractive financial terms and broad reach. With its grand opening next week the Windows Store will have a strong line-up of apps. Just as with the hardware, the line-up of apps will become more robust overtime. In addition to delivering Windows 8 next week, we will also launch Surface designed to be the ultimate stage for Windows; Surface allows users to seamlessly transition between consumption and creation and as an example of the substantial innovation that is enabled by Windows 8. We are hard at work manufacturing the devices and will ramp production overtime. October 26th only marks the beginning of the journey we will take together with our partners and developers. Our collective success will be evident overtime as we change the way people experience the power of technology. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill and we\u2019ll take some questions.\nBill Koefoed: Thanks Peter. And with that, Peter and I will take some questions. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Gabrielle, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Yes, of course. (Operator Instructions) Our first question does come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.\nRick Sherlund: On the Windows and Windows Live division there was no real guidance for the year; you just said you would recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Can you just help us understand what the variables are that we should be thinking about other than what the PC market grows out; and by PC market, I think we need to find out as you know, all Windows 8 compatible devices including tablets. So are there mix shift issues, the price you realized on a tablet versus traditional notebook; what are kind of variables we should be thinking about in terms of how to model Windows and Windows Live revenues for the year?\nPeter Klein: Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right. One of the exciting things about Windows 8 is how it really redefines, so how people think about devices and the experiences they get across those devices and up until now, that\u2019s sort of narrowly been defined as PCs or tablets and customers have been forced to choose and may trade-off, frankly of what they get. With Windows 8, you can kind of get whatever you want at whatever price point you want. So whether you want convertible with touch and pen and integration with your line of business apps, or do you want a tablet for great information and communications and entertainment, whether you want a touch ultrabook, all those things come into play and all those things are available with Windows 8. And I think overtime, we're going to see how that plays out and that\u2019s the opportunity for us and it's really a factor of thinking about how all those are going to play against each other.\nBill Koefoed: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeather Bellini: Just to Rick\u2019s question a little bit more specifically and I was on another call before this, maybe you said it. But, can you give us a sense of your expectations for Surface in the quarter, or if you can\u2019t do that, can you give us a sense for what pre-orders were thus far, just to give us a sense of how that\u2019s ramping out of the gate and what your expectations are there for that?\nPeter Klein: Yeah, thanks Heather, right now we\u2019re focused on our launch both of Surface and Windows 8 next week and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re excited about and the opportunity to show people all the great devices, all the great capabilities and so we\u2019re not talking about that now. As we mentioned on the call, we\u2019re working hard on production, we\u2019re ramping production, we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019ve heard so far, the feedbacks are great, the reviews have been really good. And I think that demonstrates what we\u2019ve been talking about, the capabilities and experiences that Windows 8 delivers across various form factors. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nAdam Holt: I am going to shift to the Server and Tools business; the billings were a little bit better than we thought, but the recognized revenue in the forward guide was a little bit lighter than we have been looking for. And I just want to drill in to some of the expectations for the forward guidance. Are you assuming the transactional environment remains weak? Do you still think you can outpace the transactional piece in terms of your business and what should we be thinking about in terms of the convergence of billings and recognize revenue? Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Yeah, thanks Adam; what we are continuing to see is that a migration from transactional revenue to multiyear licensing agreements, which is great, because it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driving the business, which is the vision we have for the roadmap, the resonance that has with our customers and so they\u2019re making long-term commitments to the platform. And so, it\u2019s one of the reasons we gave you the bookings number and the multiyear licensing revenue number of 20% and 19%, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing and so as that\u2019s growing faster than the transactional you\u2019ll see the bookings and the backlog grow and the recognize will follow overtime. So that\u2019s really the thing to watch for in Server and Tools and we continue to be very bullish on that opportunity across the board whether that\u2019s to Window server, system center what we are doing in the private cloud and public cloud and certainly with SQL Server. So that trend that we are seeing in the migration to the multiyear licensing agreements is driving that business both now and for the long-term.\nBill Koefoed: And just to build on that, this is one of the strongest bookings quarters we\u2019ve had in the last several years, so again for a $19 billion business to have over 20% bookings growth we feel obviously in addition to all the products that have come so far this year I think we feel pretty excited about the opportunity in that business. So thanks for asking that question. Gabrielle, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nMark Moerdler: So question, given the slowdown in the PCs, how should we think about the change or what\u2019s going on in the Windows adoption processes; are we seeing continuation at the current rate or is this some proportional slowdown in the roll out of Windows 7?\nPeter Klein: We continue to see -- you are talking about enterprise adoption?\nMark Moerdler: Right.\nPeter Klein: We continue to see that grow this quarter although at a slower rate than we had in past quarters, so that opportunity remains very large. We are over 50% deployed and remember the end-of-life for XP is about a year and half away, so that remains a great opportunity for us that we see continuing on.\nMark Moerdler: But it is slowing a bit?\nPeter Klein: It did this quarter.\nBill Koefoed: It did yeah just this quarter and it\u2019s a summer quarter, so I don\u2019t know that I would read too much into just one period. Gabrielle, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.\nWalter Pritchard: Just to follow on with some launch questions, so there are sort of two changes here to the business that we will see going forward, one is the hardware piece in Windows and the other is, what looks like a pretty big ramp-up on the retail side with some store presence; understanding that the latter is probably in your guidance. Can you just remind us on the store side, where are you allocating the expenses and is that presence potentially grows overtime; how you expect that to the impact your financials? And then on Surface, should it be anything we think about other than sort of a price time to unit and making margin assumption, are there any other new ones around, the way you account for Surface in your financials?\nPeter Klein: First question was about the retail stores and were they showing up\u2026\nWalter Pritchard: Yeah, where the expenses are?\nPeter Klein: Got it. The expenses are [incorp] and they show up a little bit in COGS and a little bit in operating expenses.\nBill Koefoed: And sorry, what was the second part of your question?\nWalter Pritchard: To on Surface, I mean is there anything else, we should be thinking about in terms of how to model the impact of Surface; we know the price, we can make a unit assumption, we can make a margin assumption. Is there any deferrals, any OpEx impact and warranty you know\u2026..?\nPeter Klein: Yeah, you\u2019re thinking about it right.\nBill Koefoed: Gabrielle, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nKash Rangan: As you enter the world of the new form factors; since you\u2019re coming little bit behind relative to Apple, what is the right way to think about your differentiation relative to the consumer market, opportunity for tablets and the enterprise market opportunity for tablets? Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Well, I think one of our differentiations is we give everybody what they want for the purpose they want it. When I talk to CIOs for example and the enterprises, one of the things they really excited about is that Windows 8 devices give them a chance for their employees that uses that technology to have the devices they want and bring to work, they get the kind of manageability, security, integration to go on in business apps they want. So I think there is a big differentiation in the enterprise across all the form factors especially tablets that that are increasingly coming in for a place. On the consumer side, I think there not only a range of price points and different kinds of form factors, but also unique and differentiated set of services and experiences that come with the device including Office, including SkyDrive, including Xbox Music. So I think across the board we see similar differentiation both in the enterprise and on the consumer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.\nBrent Thill: Peter if Surface is successful, shouldn\u2019t the cogs be well above the high single-digit growth for the fiscal year. I was just curious why you excluded, are you just waiting to see how the traction is before you give us more guidance or what is the explanation for that?\nPeter Klein: Yeah, that's exactly right (inaudible).\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPM.\nJohn DiFucci: I have a question on the deferred revenue specifically for the Windows business. Even if you exclude the adjustments, deferred revenue for this business increased in the quarter. And you normally or actually you always see a seasonal decline. I guess can you talk a little bit about that. What are we seeing there, is this tied to multi-year deals in this business now or is there something you do, or some of these adjustments maybe we are not accounting for correctly.\nPeter Klein: It actually is that its multiyear licensing deals is continuing to grow double-digits so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the deferred there. That's one sort of example of how enterprises are continuing to see value and adopting Windows.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Gillis with BGC Financials.\nColin Gillis: Looking at the Server and Tools line again, when the results first printed we were asked quite a bit if that was showing any weakness in the enterprise [spend] environment. It sounds like a lot of that was just driven by the rotation to multiple year contracts. But can you talk about the market place right now, and if the market place is weakening, do you find out to be an advantage given the cost preferences in that line?\nPeter Klein: It definitely is the migration from transaction licensing. Irrespective of a weak market, strong market, we\u2019ve got a great value, and it does play very well in tough macroeconomic times, because one of our great value proposition is the savings and efficiencies people get from using integrated technology across their stack at a really good price performance characteristic. So I would say, we feel great about our value proposition in any environment, does play very well in a tough macro environment. But what we're seeing now in the financials this is how we highlight bookings growth and multi-year licensing growth. It\u2019s related more towards the migration from the transactional business.\nOperator: Okay, our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nPhilip Winslow: Alright, thanks guys. Just have a question on just the margins of Surface, kind of the high level doing in an exact margin percentage. But how did you get sort of price Surface relative to (inaudible). I mean, obviously you guys talked about this one including implied your revenue amount for Windows license. Did you also take in to account sort of a weighted average or [tax] rate of Office for the buyers and then you add on a gross margin for the hardware. Just kind of how you built up to that, and then just kind of a high level, what was the pricing thoughts behind service. Was it the drivers, just adoption of the platform, was it actually may be some business, and does it change at all, near-term versus longer term? Thanks.\nPeter Klein: As a [ready] pricing decision, it\u2019s really about the value proposition effort through your customers and the degree of capabilities and value you are delivering to them at a variety of price points for what they want. And that\u2019s really fundamentally what drives all of our pricing decisions. Do we have a really compelling value to offer our customers with the capabilities that we\u2019re delivering, and that\u2019s what we do across all our business and that\u2019s what drives our economic performance.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.\nEd Maguire: Looking at how you\u2019re beginning to combine products and services with Office 365 for home and then, the bundling of services with Windows RT. Looking forward, is this going to change the way that you allocate, what might have been transactional revenues in the past to accommodate those transactional and services revenues?\nPeter Klein: Yeah, generally that is correct. As we move to more delivery at services that will show up as services revenue as oppose to transactional revenue, that\u2019s correct. But I do think, it\u2019s a long-term trend and you saw that in the commentary that we made around our server and tools business. But we are having people that are making longer term commitments to Microsoft, and that shows up in our annuity business and server, it shows up in things like Office 365 where people are having a subscription service, it shows up in things like Xbox LIVE which you\u2019ve seen happening over the last couple of years. So, Ed, I think you\u2019ve got it right that we\u2019re seeing a lot more people that are committing to a longer term relationship with Microsoft which is clearly what we\u2019re striving toward.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.\nBrad Reback: Peter, historically the transactional aspect of MBD has followed the PC market roughly. Is there any reason to think that that\u2019s not the case here for the final three quarters?\nPeter Klein: Yeah, in general there are two things that impact the transactional business at MBD, one is PC market and the other is product cycle. So one of the things we also see period right before a launch of a new product from a transactional side and businesses is a slowdown, and also it does track the PC market. So those are the two things to keep an eye on.\nOperator: Alright. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Historically when we had to launch a Windows product there was a big uptake especially on the consumer side. Now this time around it\u2019s obviously different from the factors that are playing in and consumers need to get used to it. How do you think about the momentum we should see in terms of the first quarter or the second quarter etcetera? Thank you.\nPeter Klein: Well without giving specific [items] we are certainly very excited about the capabilities that come with Windows 8 and the excitement that comes from that, and we are excited to talk about that at the launch next week. I think I am encouraged by what we saw from the Windows 8 selling that we\u2019ve seen so far the 40% growth over the comparable period last time. So we will just keep an eye on that and watch as we get further into the launch.\nOperator: Alright our final question comes from Greg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGreg Moskowitz: This is somewhat of a follow up t Raimo\u2019s question. Over the past several months many of those reviewing Windows 8 for PCs while praising the significant innovation behind the OS have also continued to focus on the dual interfaces and the adjustment that users will have to make. Is that something that causes you concern just when it comes to initial adoption levels of Windows 8. Just wondering how you think about that?\nPeter Klein: Not a lot, I hear the feedback and as a user we sort of have gotten used to it very quickly. At Microsoft when we do an innovation historically across our products often times there is new things that comes and I understand initially people do look at those things. And what we see overtime is that those innovations have delivered way more value, way more productivity and way more better usability. And so I am very confidence that is even more true with the great technology and capabilities and experiences that we have at Windows 8.\nBill Koefoed: And I think you have seen that the use of people who have used it over a longer period of time. And again for those who will be helpfully using it early. You will see that shopping your experience as well. Okay, so that\u2019s going to wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous events and conferences in which we will be participating in this quarter. For those of you unable to attend and personally, these events will generally be webcast and you will be able to follow along at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need additional details. Thanks again for joining us today and have a great day.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."}], "2015": [{"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 4, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-07-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to Microsoft\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Roya. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a slide deck which provides summary of our financial results, a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and the table of noted items to aid in understanding our results this quarter. Additionally, the slide deck contains detailed information regarding the impact of the Nokia devices and services acquisition on our financial results. Our press release is also on the website and includes an addendum with additional information about our fourth quarter performance. Microsoft is reporting the financial performance and acquired Nokia devices and services business in a new segment called Phone Hardware. Additionally, the devices and consumer hardware segment was renamed the Computing and Gaming Hardware. The products included in this renamed segment remain the same. Current year information reflects the financial performance of the acquired business beginning on April 25, 2014. Any reference to operating expense includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes integration and restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise specified all impacted numbers have been adjusted for non-GAAP and noted items which are detailed in our press release in slide deck. We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\u2019s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission in the transcript in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website, until July 22, 2015. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ, because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Chris, and good afternoon everyone. This month is an important time for Microsoft. As the leadership team we\u2019re taking bold and decisive action to evolve our organization and culture. This includes difficult steps, but they are necessary to position Microsoft for future growth and industry leadership. Today, we\u2019ll spend more time talking about the significant changes we\u2019re driving. However, let me first start with this quarter\u2019s results, after that Satya will talk more about our path forward and then I\u2019ll share our financial outlook before we take your questions. As I think about our strong execution this quarter, there are three things that stand out to me, significant momentum with our cloud services, progress in a number of our consumer businesses and continued cost discipline. Our total fourth quarter revenue was $23 billion including $2 billion from the phone hardware segment. As you know our Q4 guidance did not include the impact of the acquisition of Nokia\u2019s devices and services business. Excluding that we grew revenue 10% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Moving on to earnings per share. Before the impact of the acquisition and the noted items Chris highlighted earlier, EPS grew 12% to $0.66. These details can be found in the earnings slide deck on our Investor Relations website. Geographically, performance was strong across most markets, particularly in North America and in Europe. We did, however, see challenging conditions in China or like many other multinationals we\u2019re experiencing a weak business environment which we do not expect to change in the near term. Our commercial cloud revenue grew 147% this quarter, driven by both Office 365 and Azure. Our commercial cloud annual revenue run rate more than doubled this year and now exceeds $4.4 billion and with this rapidly growing scale we continue to expand our cloud gross margins. We saw strong commercial seat growth across Office 365 particularly with SMB customers. Additionally, we added over 1 million new subscribers to Office 365, Home and Personal and we ended the quarter with 5.6 million users. Azure has also grown dramatically, with storage doubling and compute tripling this year. Along with increased usage of our core services, over 50% of our Azure customers are now also using higher value services like the Enterprise Mobility Suite, which are seeing strong adoption since the May launch. We\u2019re pleased that our customers are enthusiastically embracing Office 365, Azure, CRM Online and our other cloud services, especially considering it\u2019s still early in the cloud transition. Each customer has unique deployment needs and as a result CIOs value the flexibility that our hybrid cloud offerings provide. You can see this in our commercial bookings, which grew 23% this quarter and our contracted not billed balance now exceeds $24 billion. As we previously discussed in fiscal year 2014 both the quarter and the year presented a large renewal opportunity, our differentiated value proposition combined with strong execution kept our renewal rates very high. In addition to transitioning to the cloud, our customers continue to invest in premium versions of our on-prem server products like Window Server, System Center and SQL Server. As a result, our server licensing revenue grew 14% this quarter. We feel good about the progress we\u2019re making with Windows. Developed markets continue to show stability and we\u2019re encouraged by the initial response from OEMs to our new consumer offerings like Windows with Bing. This quarter OEM revenue grew 3% as we saw the commercial hardware refresh cycle continue with businesses updating their devices and renewing their commitment to the Windows platform. XP end of support contributed to the double-digit growth in both Windows Pro and volume licensing, though the benefits moderated throughout the quarter. In Bing, we continue to see growth in both usage and monetization. This quarter U.S. search query share exceeded 19% and RPS grew double-digits again. As we saw in prior quarters, display revenue remains soft. In late June, we launched Surface Pro 3. While it\u2019s still early sales are outpacing earlier versions of Surface Pro and we are excited to bring the device to many more markets this summer. During the quarter, we reassessed our product roadmap and decided not to ship a new form factor that was under development. Combined with the transition of production to our latest Surface offering, we made inventory adjustments which impacted our gross margins. Also in June, we released our new Xbox One offering and we\u2019re pleased with the response. At E3 we reasserted our focus on games with blockbuster titles and key exclusives coming this holiday. With the progress we are making in channel inventories, the new market for Xbox One and our exciting game line up, we feel well-positioned heading into the holiday season. With the closing of the Nokia devices and services acquisition during the quarter, we established a new segment Phone Hardware to provide transparency into the progress we\u2019ll make as we improve and grow the phone business. This quarter, Lumia device sales were primarily driven by good performance in the lower price point 500 and 600 series. Sales of non-Lumia devices were in line with the overall feature phone market dynamics. Our gross margins were impacted by decisions we made to rationalize the device portfolio, as well as acquisition related amortization expense. Across the company, we grew gross margin by $1 billion or 7%. While the faster growing cloud and hardware businesses impacted our overall company gross margin percentage it\u2019s important to note we continue to drive margin growth in key areas with improved discipline and business process. In D&C other revenue from search advertising and subscriptions are driving gross margin growth, in commercial other margins expanded again in this quarter benefiting from both improved business scale and datacenter efficiency in our cloud services. And we\u2019ve made key changes to our hardware business, which have been discussed by both Satya and Stephen Elop in the past two weeks. We\u2019ve also kept our focus on rigorous operating expense discipline. Excluding the addition of about $750 million from NDS, our Q4 operating expense came in at the low end of our guidance. And for the full year, with disciplined decision-making, we grew revenue 9% before NDS more than twice as fast operating expense which grew 4%. Our effective tax rate was higher this quarter. Part of this was due to an adjustment to prior year taxes related to intercompany transfer pricing. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of NDS results and our changing geographic mix. In Q4, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to finish this fiscal year at $15.7 billion, an increase of 28% over the prior year. With that overview, let me turn it over to Satya to share some thoughts.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Amy. Hello everyone. I\u2019m proud of the results we delivered this quarter and across the fiscal year. In Q4, on an operating basis we grew revenue 10% and operating income 12%. We accelerated our commercial cloud business to a $4.4 billion annual run rate. And perhaps more importantly we made bold and disciplined decisions to define our core as the productivity and a platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world. Before I get into the investment principles and decisions, I want to explain how our focus on productivity and platforms leads us to participate in cloud and mobile markets. Mobility for us goes beyond just devices. While we are certainly focused on building great phones and tablets, we think of mobility more expansively. We think the opportunity that comes from running our productivity experiences on Windows, iOS and Android device. Office 365 and dynamic SaaS offerings are targeted here. We also see great opportunity in simplifying and managing the user experiences spanning multiple devices ecosystems with our identity management, device management and data security. This is the focus of our enterprise mobility suite. Similarly, when it comes to the cloud opportunity, we run an at-scale public cloud service and provide servers for private and hybrid clouds. Azure, StorSimple, InMage and our datacenter additions of server products across Window Server, System Center and SQL Server all help us participate in the cloud growth. Our mobile and cloud opportunity views informs our decisions on what to build and where to invest. More specifically, we use the following three principles to guide our investments. First, focus investments on the core, productivity experiences and platform investments will prioritize across engineering, sales, marketing as well as M&A. Second, consolidate overlapping efforts. This means one operating system that covers all screen sizes and consolidated dual use productivity services that cross life and work. Third, run all businesses in an economically sound way. We will get crystal clear on the core businesses that drive long-term differentiation and the businesses that support them. For those supporting efforts such as MSN retail stores and hardware, we will also ensure disciplined financial execution. Now let\u2019s talk about the specific investments. We will be relentless in our focus on our core digital work and life experiences and the two platforms that support it, the cloud operating system and the device operating system and hardware. Everything we do starts with digital work and life experiences to delight dual users; these are users who use technology both at work and in their personal life. This is how we reinvent productivity. Last year, we started to take steps in this direction, now OneDrive and OneDrive for business are one team. Outlook and Exchange are one team, Skype and Lync are one team all focused on those dual user scenarios. We are clear that our experiences are going to be available on all devices. We have a specific goal for multiple Microsoft applications to be available on every home screen. This is why we brought Office to the iPad and now there are more than 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. We believe productivity experiences will go beyond individual applications to deliver ambient intelligence that spans applications. To that end, we introduced Cortana, our personnel assistant in Windows Phone 8.1. We also believe that productivity includes group collaboration and business processes within organization. In February, we announced our Power BI suite to help customers harness the power of big data in order to drive a data culture and greater productivity within their organizations. Power BI suite enables you to ask natural language questions, do rich visualizations and collaborate around data. Customers are loving it, in fact the average monthly users have grown over 130%. We are pleased to see all up dynamics growth at 13% for the quarter with CRM online nearly doubling. And it\u2019s great now to have dynamic CRM in the Gartner leaders\u2019 quadrant in both sales and service, the two-most relevant areas in the CRM space. Looking forward in fiscal year 2015, we are increasing our investment in R&D and sales for our digital work and life businesses even as we cut total operating expenses. We have a rich roadmap going forward. Two examples of our innovation are what we are doing with Delve and Skype Translator. Delve is an Office 365 cloud-based service that is the first in the new breed of intelligent and social work experiences. Delve will turn enterprise search on its head as information that is relevant to you finds you. Think of this as the Facebook [new] [ph] suite for productivity. Skype Translator will break down the language barriers in our communications and impact everything from everyday conversations with friends to education to global business. Additionally, I\u2019m pleased to see the progress with Bing now more than 19% U.S. query share and strong RPS growth. Going forward, we will drive our Bing related investments to contribute to the core digital work in life experiences such as Cortana, Smart Search, Delve, Power Q&A and many others. We expect Bing to be profitable on a standalone basis in FY16. Now let\u2019s transition to the Cloud OS. Our Cloud OS represents the fastest growing opportunity for Microsoft. Quarter-after-quarter, we drive growth and customer adoption. Our server products benefit from our public cloud. The fact that we use our servers to run our cloud make our server software the most capable enabling others to build and operate their clouds. This has led to growth in Hyper-V share, which is now at 30.6% and has helped grow datacenter additions, the Window Server and System Center both up more than 40% for the year. We also had another breakout year for SQL server. With SQL server 14, we released industry leading in-memory technology across all database workloads of online transaction processing, data warehousing and business intelligence. And we grew our SQL business by more than 19%. Our business Azure business is growing rapidly and we further accelerated growth last year. We grew our datacenter footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China while doubling our capacity in existing regions. In FY14, we also started to see the adoption of our high-value services on top of our base cloud infrastructure. We announced the enterprise mobility suite a comprehensive cloud solution to address the consumerization of IT challenges such as Bring Your Own Device and SaaS application adoption. EMS brings together identity management, device management and data security into one IT control plane and architecture. The early data from customer adoption for EMS is very encouraging. We announced the Azure intelligence system service, our IOT service in the cloud that enables organization to securely connect manage and capture machine generated data from a variety of sensors and devices. To support these high value services in Azure, I have prioritized acquisition such as GreenButton for Big Compute, Capptain for Mobile backend services. And just in the past few weeks InMage for disaster recovery for hybrid clouds. In FY15, we will make investments to drive this strategy forward. We will expand our Azure datacenter footprint and increase capacity in existing regions. We will launch new high level services including Azure machine learning that currently is in preview. We will expand our hybrid solutions with new services such as StorSimple, InMage as well as our server products all offering cloud tearing. We will continue to build out the EMS value proposition and we will expand our sales efforts to drive growth. Let\u2019s transition to our device OS and hardware, the third component of our core. In everything we do with our Windows OS and first party devices, we will line up our digital work and life experiences. We are approaching the Windows OS business with a bold challenging mindset and pushing both the product and business model forward. We start with a focus on business customers in FY14, we saw these customers recommit to Windows. In April, we released an update to Windows 8.1. To start, we improved the core desktop experience with mouse and keyboard advancements. For Enterprises, we released Internet Explorer Enterprise Mode and extended our mobile device management capability. With Windows 8.1 update, we also lowered hardware spec required so that OEMs can build tablets and clamshells at lower price points. In addition, we made the decision to evolve the Windows business model. Now, Windows licenses are $0 for any OEM building a device less than 9 inches. We also added a low cost Windows offering with Bing integration for OEM. This new offering combine with lower hardware spec means OEMs will bring a fantastic line up of value based notebooks and tablets to the markets this holiday. In June, we launched Surface Pro 3. The most productivity tablet on the market today. The reason it\u2019s the most productivity tablet on the market is because we top through the experience end-to-end. For example, one of the things you will notice with Surface Pro 3 is how it excels at note taking. You can jot down your thoughts rapidly just like with the pen and paper. To make this work in an integrated natural way, our developers pulled together one vision to right code that resides in the firmware and the Surface Pro 3 pen, the Windows shell and its inking support to reduce the [parallel x] [ph] header as well as in OneNote. And as Amy said, we are optimistic given the early sign from the Surface Pro 3s performance in the market. On phones, we saw a good early start to Lumia 630 and 635 as well as Lumia 930 especially in Europe. In the year ahead, we are investing in ways that will ensure our device OS and first party hardware aligned to our core. We will streamline the next version of Windows from three operating systems into one single converged operating system for screens of all sizes. We will unify our stores, commerce and developer platforms to drive a more coherent user experience and a broader developer opportunity. We look forward to sharing more about our next major wave of Windows enhancements in the coming months. Our approach to first party hardware going forward is clear. At times, we will develop new categories like we did with Surface and we will responsibly make the market for Windows phone. However, we are not in the hardware for hardware sake, and the first party device portfolio will be aligned to our strategic direction as the productivity and platform company. As I said before, going forward all the devices will be created with an explicit purpose to light up our digital work and life experiences. Good examples of this today are what we are doing with Surface Pro 3 for note taking and PPI for meetings. You can expect to see this type of innovation in our hardware including phones. Amy will talk more on our plans for disciplined execution on our hardware business going forward. I want to make a few comments on Xbox. It\u2019s important for us to have a core that\u2019s thriving. It\u2019s equally important to play smart bold bets in other areas where we have the ability to add value and have impact that\u2019s what we are doing with Xbox. We made the decision to manage Xbox to maximize enterprise value with a focus on gaming. Gaming is the largest digital live category in a mobile first-cloud first world. It\u2019s also the place where our past success a revered brand and passionate fan base present us a special opportunity. With our decision to specifically focus on gaming, we expect to close Xbox entertainment studios and streamline our investments in music and video. We will invest in our core console gaming in Xbox live with a view towards the broader PC and mobile opportunity. I hope you can see that we have bold ambitions and we have made a lot of progress. Also know that we are well on the way in evolving our organization and culture to deliver on these bold ambitions. This includes simplifying how we work and modernizing our engineering processes. In all that we do, we will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders empowering everybody individual and organization to do more and achieve more in a mobile first cloud first world is a huge undertaking and it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on and change the world. Thank you. And with that let me turn it over to Amy to give you more guidance on FY15.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Satya. Before going into details about our outlook, let me first say that all forward-looking information assumes the macroeconomic environment remain stable throughout this coming fiscal year. As Satya detailed, we are taking bold steps to move Microsoft forward with a renewed sense of clarity and alignment. Our investment plan reflects those changes as to reallocate resources to aggressively drive toward our goals and pursue the highest growth and financial return businesses. Even as we invest for growth, we expect our total operating expense in fiscal year 2015 to be down from this past year before considering the addition of the Nokia cost structure and integration and restructuring cost. Now, let me address phone separately. In fiscal year 2014, we recorded about $750 million of operating expense for the phone business for the period post the acquisition. Annualized this would have been about $4.5 billion, but we are aggressively working to drive synergies across key functions such as development, supply chain and operations as we integrate and right-size the business. We set to realize more than $1 billion in synergies and as a result we will be on a path to reach operating break-even for the phone business in fiscal year 2016. Including phone, we expect operating expense to be between $34.2 billion and $34.6 billion in fiscal year 2015. In addition to the expense guidance I just provided and as we announced on July 17th, we expect to incur between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion in restructuring expense. These will be substantially complete in the first half of the fiscal year. Separately, we will also incur about $150 million per quarter in integration cost such as systems work. Similar to this quarter, we will continue to report these items in a separate line item in the income statement. Now, let me give our view on the first quarter starting with devices and consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This range reflects an ongoing business PC refresh cycle, headwinds for consumer PCs and a continued moderation of the benefits from the XP end of support. In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $2 billion. This range reflects the continuing ramp of Surface Pro 3 and Xbox 1 as both products are introduced into new markets in Q1. In phone hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion as we de-align the device portfolio to our strategy. And in devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Moving on to commercial. We expect revenue across our two segments to be $12.0 billion to $12.2 billion within this we expect commercial other revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. And in corporate, we expect about $300 million of negative impact next quarter. We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.9 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments. We expect first quarter operating expense excluding integration of restructuring to be between $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%. This is in line with the fourth quarter excluding the prior period tax adjustment. As a changing mix of our business, as well as the impact of the NDS acquisition will continue to influence our tax rate. Investments in cloud infrastructure are necessary to support and enable the significant growth and momentum in our cloud services. In Q1, we expect CapEx to increase sequentially to further support our growth. Similar to fiscal year 2014, these investments are decided based on the thorough review of demand and capacity plans to ensure that the investments provide an appropriate return on capital. We also remain focused on software driven innovation to increase the utilization and capacity of the capital we deploy. We expect our revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality. In closing, Q1 is the start of an incredibly important year for Microsoft. We are making important changes to our organization and culture to enable and empower our people to do their very best work. Mobility in cloud presents an enormous opportunity. And we are focusing resources on our core so we can capitalize and deliver on the next wave of innovation, growth and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. And with that we will move to Q&A. Operator please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. I have got two parts to it. The first is Satya you have been changing the engineering processes within the company adding more analytics to the process. How do you see this change impacting both the product and the speed to go to market?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Two things, Mark. One is the diversity of products that Microsoft has from Silicon tape outs to services that we\u2019re continuously updating in Azure or Office 365 is a lot more than let\u2019s say when we first created the Microsoft engineering system that was for retail packaged product, so since then a lot has changed and a lot has evolved. And so what we are doing is, we are introducing new functions and new skills, design is even more important than it ever was, data analytics as you said is very important to us and they are not outside functions. They are functions that are integral to how we do product development, how we do AB testing, how we do log analysis on a continuous basis. So that\u2019s the engineering process and culture change that we have ongoing and in fact a lot of learning from variety of different teams that\u2019s now spreading across a lot of Microsoft.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. And Amy one quick question, we saw a significant acceleration this quarter in cloud revenue, or I guess Amy or Satya, we saw acceleration in cloud revenue year-over-year what\u2019s \u2013 is this Office for the iPad, is this Azure, what\u2019s driving the acceleration and how long do you think we can keep this going?\nAmy Hood: Mark, why don\u2019t I take it and if Satya wants to add, obviously, he should do that. In general, I wouldn\u2019t point to one product area. It was across Office 365, Azure and even CRM online. I think some of the important dynamics that you could point to particularly in Office 365 I really think over the course of the year we saw an acceleration in moving the product down the market into increasing what we would call the mid-market and even small business at a pace. That\u2019s a particular place I would tie back to some of the things Satya mentioned in the answer to your first question. Improvements to analytics, improvements to understanding the use scenarios, improving the product in real-time, understanding trial, ease of use, ease of sign-up all of these things actually can afford us the ability to go to different categories, go to different geos into different segments. And in addition, I think what you will see Mark as we initially moved many of our customers to Office 365, it came on one workload. And I think what we\u2019ve increasingly seen is our ability to add more workloads and sell the entirety of the suite through that process. I also mentioned in Azure, our increased ability to sell some of these higher value services. So while, I can speak broadly but all of them, I think I would generally think about the strength as being both completion of our products suite, ability to enter new segments and ability to sell new workloads.\nSatya Nadella: The only thing I would add is it\u2019s the combination of our SaaS offerings like Dynamics and Office 365, a public cloud offering in Azure. But also our private and hybrid cloud infrastructure which also benefits because they run on our servers, cloud runs on our servers. So it\u2019s that combination which makes us both unique and reinforcing. And the best example is what we are doing with Azure active directory, the fact that somebody gets on-boarded to Office 365 means that tenant information is in Azure AD that fact that the tenant information is in Azure AD is what makes EMS or our Enterprise Mobility Suite more attractive to a customer managing iOS, Android or Windows devices. That network effect is really now helping us a lot across all of our cloud efforts.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Mark.\nChris Suh: Thanks Mark.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you, I appreciate. Congrats on the quarter.\nChris Suh: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thank you. Amy, you\u2019re taking a very disciplined approach on the expenses, just curious if you could help everyone understand how you are approaching that and your confidence in doing more with less?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Brent. Let me actually, I\u2019ll start and I think Satya actually will have some things to add. This is first of all I would start by saying I wouldn\u2019t describe the behavior to me. I would describe the behavior to a senior leadership team and to a group that\u2019s focused on investing in the core, focus on making trade-offs, focused on really accelerating our growth in key areas. Our ability to make changes really throughout the second half of this year in particular and as we\u2019ve led into fiscal year 2015 is really about a group focused on building and investing in something that can really be even greater than it is today. And so while I would use the word disciplined, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about a person, and it shouldn\u2019t be, it should be about an environment and which every person here thinks about how they can increase their ROI and accrue to the collective. And I think we\u2019ve actually seen the benefits of that in the past few quarters and I think you\u2019ll see it as we head into 2015.\nSatya Nadella: I think you captured well.\nAmy Hood: Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thanks Brent. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent, thank you for the question and a very nice quarter. First, I think to talk a little bit about the growth strategy at Nokia, you guys look to cut expenses pretty aggressively there, but this is \u2013 particularly smartphones is a very competitive marketplace, can you tell us a little bit about sort of the strategy to how you actually start to gain share with Lumia on a going forward basis? And maybe give us an idea of what levels of share or what levels of kind unit volumes are you going to need to hit to get to that breakeven in FY16?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start and Amy you can even add. So overall, we are very focused on I would say thinking about mobility share across the entire Windows family. I already talked about in my remarks about how mobility for us even goes beyond devices, but for this specific question I would even say that, we want to think about mobility not just one form factor of a mobile device because I think that\u2019s where the ultimate prize is. But that said, we are even year-over-year basis seeing increased volume for Lumia, it\u2019s coming at the low end in the entry smartphone market and we are pleased with it. It\u2019s come in many markets we now have over 10% that\u2019s the first market I would sort of say that we need to track country-by-country. And the key places where we are going to differentiate is looking at productivity scenarios or the digital work and life scenario that we can light up on our phone in unique ways. When I can take my Office Lens App use the camera on the phone take a picture of anything and have it automatically OCR recognized and into OneNote in searchable fashion that\u2019s the unique scenario. What we have done with Surface and PPI shows us the way that there is a lot more we can do with phones by broadly thinking about productivity. So this is not about just a Word or Excel on your phone, it is about thinking about Cortana and Office Lens and those kinds of scenarios in compelling ways. And that\u2019s what at the end of the day is going to drive our differentiation and higher end Lumia phones.\nAmy Hood: And Keith to answer your specific question, regarding FY16, I think we\u2019ve made the difficult choices to get the cost base to a place where we can deliver on the exact scenario Satya as outlined, and we do assume that we continue to grow our units through the year and into 2016 in order to get to breakeven.\nKeith Weiss: Okay.\nChris Suh: Thank you Keith. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just wanted to dig into Office 365, you put up another quarter of pretty impressive metrics gone up to 5.6 million home premium users, I think the commercial side grew, I think was 98% year-over-year and Satya you talked about some pretty meaningful download numbers as far as on iPad. I wonder if you could give us an update on Office 365 sort of how it\u2019s doing versus your expectations and sort of and so what is your expectations are over the course of next 12, 18, 24 months as we continue this transition?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Phil. In terms of versus our expectations, in this quarter it did do better than we expected and frankly we had quite lofty goals. So I think that is encouraging. And I think I talked about some of those key drivers in the prior question, when I think really about Home and Personal, we haven\u2019t had a chance to talk specifically about the consumer usage and you sort of referenced Office on the iPad in your question, I think it\u2019s really about continuing to make the subscription value whether it\u2019s through the Home SKU or the Personal SKU have the most value to a user. It\u2019s about a user having the opportunity to access Office, the world\u2019s leading productivity app on the device of their choice having a light up to the very best on Windows devices and having that accrue back to our subscriptions. And so I think our ability to execute on that over the past, I guess 18 months that we\u2019ve had these SKUs in market is quite encouraging. I don\u2019t really look to Office on the iPad as one item is a part of the value proposition that I think we make both in the consumer segment as well as in the commercial segment.\nPhil Winslow: Okay, got it.\nChris Suh: Thanks Phil.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Phil.\nChris Suh: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Sherlund: Thanks. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the Office for a moment. I\u2019m curious whether you think we\u2019ve seen the worst for Office here with the consumer fall off. In Office 365 growth in margins expanding their \u2013 just sort of if you can look through the dynamics and give us a sense, do you think you are actually turned the corner there and we may be seeing the worse in terms of Office growth and margins?\nSatya Nadella: Rick, let me just start qualitatively in terms of how I view Office, the category and how it relates to productivity broadly and then I\u2019ll have Amy even specifically talk about margins and what we are seeing in terms of I\u2019m assuming Office renewals is that probably the question. First of all, I believe the category that Office is in, which is productivity broadly for people, the group as well as organization is something that we are investing significantly and seeing significant growth in. On one end you have new things that we are doing like Cortana. This is for individuals on new form factors like the phones where it\u2019s not about anything that application, but an intelligent agent that knows everything about my calendar, everything about my life and tries to help me with my everyday task. On the other end, it\u2019s something like Delve which is a completely new tool that\u2019s taking some \u2013 what is enterprise search and making it more like the Facebook news feed where it has a graph of all my artifacts, all my people, all my group and uses that graph to give me relevant information and discover. Same thing with Power Q&A and Power BI, it\u2019s a part of Office 365. So we have a pretty expansive view of how we look at Office and what it can do. So that\u2019s the growth strategy and now specifically on Office renewals.\nAmy Hood: And I would say in general, let me make two comments. In terms of Office on the consumer side between what we sold on prem as well as the Home and Personal we feel quite good with attach continuing to grow and increasing the value prop. So I think that\u2019s to address the consumer portion. On the commercial portion, we actually saw Office grow as you said this quarter; I think the broader definition that Satya spoke to the Office value prop and we continued to see Office renewed in our enterprise agreement. So in general, I think I feel like we\u2019re in a growth phase for that franchise.\nChris Suh: Thanks Rick. Follow with the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Satya, I wanted to ask you about two statements that you made, one around responsibly making the market for Windows Phone, just kind of following on Keith\u2019s question here. And that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a really competitive market it feels like ultimately you need to be a very, very meaningful share player in that market to have value for developer to leverage the universal apps that you\u2019re talking about in terms of presentations you\u2019ve given and build in and so forth. And I\u2019m trying to understand how you can do both of those things once and in terms of responsibly making the market for Windows Phone, it feels difficult given your nearest competitors there are doing things that you might argue or irresponsible in terms of making their market given that they monetize it in different ways?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. One of beauties of universal Windows app is, it aggregates for the first time for us all of our Windows volume. The fact that even what is an app that runs with a mouse and keyboard on the desktop can be in the store and you can have the same app run in the touch-first on a mobile-first way gives developers the entire volume of Windows which is 300 plus million units as opposed to just our 4% share of mobile in the U.S. or 10% in some country. So that\u2019s really the reason why we are actively making sure that universal Windows apps is available and developers are taking advantage of it, we have great tooling. Because that\u2019s the way we are going to be able to create the broadest opportunity to your very point about developers getting an ROI for building to Windows. For that\u2019s how I think we will do it in a responsible way.\nWalter Pritchard: Great, thank you.\nChris Suh: Moving to next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much for your time. I wanted to ask a question about \u2013 Satya your comments about combining the next version of Windows and to one for all devices and just wondering if you look out, I mean you\u2019ve got kind of different SKU segmentations right now, you\u2019ve got enterprise, you\u2019ve got consumer less than 9 inches for free, the offering that you mentioned earlier that you recently announced. How do we think about when you come out with this one version for all devices, how do you see this changing kind of the go-to-market and also kind of a traditional SKU segmentation and pricing that we\u2019ve seen in the past?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. My statement Heather was more to do with just even the engineering approach. The reality is that we actually did not have one Windows; we had multiple Windows operating systems inside of Microsoft. We had one for phone, one for tablets and PCs, one for Xbox, one for even embedded. So we had many, many of these efforts. So now we have one team with the layered architecture that enables us to in fact one for developers bring that collective opportunity with one store, one commerce system, one discoverability mechanism. It also allows us to scale the UI across all screen sizes; it allows us to create this notion of universal Windows apps and being coherent there. So that\u2019s what more I was referencing and our SKU strategy will remain by segment, we will have multiple SKUs for enterprises, we will have for OEM, we will have for end-users. And so we will \u2013 be disclosing and talking about our SKUs as we get further along, but this my statement was more to do with how we are bringing teams together to approach Windows as one ecosystem very differently than we ourselves have done in the past.\nHeather Bellini: Excellent, thank you.\nChris Suh: Okay. Thanks Heather. Next question please, operator.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.\nEd Maguire: Hi, good afternoon. Satya you made some comments about harmonizing some of the different products across consumer and enterprise and I was curious what your approach is to viewing your different hardware offerings both in phone and with Surface, how you\u2019re go-to-market may change around that and also since you decided to make the operating system for sub 9-inch devices free, how you see the value proposition and your ability to monetize that user base evolving over time?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. The statement I made about bringing together our productivity applications across work and life is to really reflect the notion of dual use because when I think about productivity it doesn\u2019t separate out what I use as a tool for communication with my family and what I use to collaborate at work. So that\u2019s why having this one team that thinks about outlook.com as well as Exchange helps us think about those dual use. Same thing with files and OneDrive and OneDrive for business because we want to have the software have the smart about separating out the state carrying about IT control and data protection while me as an end user get to have the experiences that I want. That\u2019s how we are thinking about harmonizing those digital life and work experiences. On the hardware side, we would continue to build hardware that fits with these experiences if I understand your question right, which is how will be differentiate our first party hardware, we will build first party hardware that\u2019s creating category, a good example is what we have done with Surface Pro 3. And in other places where we have really changed the Windows business model to encourage a plethora of OEMs to build great hardware and we are seeing that in fact in this holiday season, I think you will see a lot of value notebooks, you will see clamshells. So we will have the full price range of our hardware offering enabled by this new windows business model. And I think the last part was how will we monetize? Of course, we will again have a combination, we will have our OEM monetization and some of these new business models are about monetizing on the backend with Bing integration as well as our services attached and that\u2019s the reason fundamentally why we have these zero-priced Windows SKUs today.\nEd Maguire: Great. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Ed.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Ed.\nChris Suh: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks. I wouldn\u2019t mind focusing for a moment on the enterprise server side that\u2019s where at least for me much of the upside came. We haven\u2019t seen server product revenue growth in the mid teens in a while. Total Microsoft bookings 20% x Nokia haven\u2019t seen that in ages. Perhaps the answers to these questions are related but what\u2019s happening with those two numbers to drive the upside. I\u2019m sure a little bit came with Azure being strong but that\u2019s relatively small so clearly there was an inflection up on the on-prem server tools business maybe part of it was renewal rates and if that\u2019s the answer how much more room do we have to go on that? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: I mean I will start then Amy, you can add. Overall, we have had a major revamp of our server line-up, SQL 14 being the recent one which we launched in the last quarter. And it\u2019s the strength of our server products, I mean this is that phenomena where our servers are becoming \u2013 are become much more competitive, Windows server for virtualization and private cloud, system center for datacenter management, SQL for all the in-memory work load capabilities it has and BI. All of that has really benefited from us running our own cloud pushing our own servers to run these add scale services. And with that being in place and these refreshers we are seeing increased investment in interest on our infrastructure when it comes to data centers. One of the things is as the public cloud is growing; we in fact don\u2019t see it. It is for now as a zero sum. In fact, we see growth especially with the virtualization rates because people are not \u2013 overall the number of applications on mobile side are growing all of those mobile applications drive backend compute and storage. And that backend compute storage some of it goes into the public cloud, but a lot of it even goes into the datacenter. And that\u2019s where we have a very good price performance equation and a TCO equation. And so we are being pretty competitive in grabbing share and Hyper-V share is a good example of that.\nAmy Hood: And I think Karl, you are right. When you triangulate the data around our strong trend line on earned, even commercial bookings growth of 23% and the numbers you exactly talked about, it really was a combination of Office 365 cloud growth as well as we talked about the benefits of our hybrid offerings a lot of on-prem server growth as well this quarter.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Karl.\nChris Suh: Operator, we will take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Moore: Great. Thanks guys. This is Jim Moore in for Dan. Can you just talk a little bit about the geographies mentioned in North America and Europe strength and maybe just talk a little more about the dynamics there in terms of where you are seeing this strength cloud or PC et cetera? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Jim. Actually I would say the strength across the products isn\u2019t geographically specific. So it\u2019s relatively consistent. We have seen cloud growth globally. We have seen on-prem server growth globally. In general, the products get launched first and often in the U.S. and so it tends to be the most mature of some of those transitional markets. But, I think in general my geographic comments are far more holistic than they are product specific.\nJim Moore: Thanks very much.\nChris Suh: Thanks. Operator, we will have time for one more question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Reback: Hey, hi, how are you?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks very much.\nBrad Reback: Satya, you guys did a very good job this year of returning capital to shareholders over $15 billion. Can you give us some sense philosophically, if you see a lot of opportunity for additional repurchase/dividend activity or is this a level you are fairly comfortable with? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks for the question. Overall, my comments remain the same. I answered this even in the last call, which is the approach we have taken is a balanced approach and a thoughtful approach. We are going to look at our own need to invest in order to drive growth in the opportunities we see. I think today\u2019s conversation and results show how some of the best we have made with our cloud are paying off. And it\u2019s great to see that momentum and it\u2019s in fact a pretty broad based momentum across Azure, Office 365 and Amy mentioned it pretty briefly even CRM online growth. So to me that remains the core, which is being able to place our capital to drive organic growth and for the long-term health of this company. That said, we will have a balanced approach in terms of both share buyback as well as dividends that\u2019s the approach we have taken over the last multiple years and that will be the same thoughtful process that I expect us to do continue with going into the next fiscal and beyond.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Brad.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Brad. Okay. That\u2019s wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. But those of you unable to attend in person these events will generally be webcast and you can follow our comments at our Investor Relations website. Please contact us if you need any additional details. And thanks again for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.\nChris Suh: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a document summarizing our quarterly results, as well as a slide deck, which is intended to follow the quarterly results document and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless otherwise specified, all impacted numbers have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year\u2019s revenue deferrals and recognition related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, the Office Deferral, the Video Game Deferral, and the expense related to the non-tax deductible European Commission Fine. As a reminder, in our segment reporting structure, we have consolidated revenue adjustments of this nature into Corporate and Other to provide better comparability of operating results. We will post this call\u2019s prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\u2019s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 24, 2015. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I will turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris. It\u2019s great to have the opportunity to join today\u2019s call. From my first day, I have said I am committed to an ongoing dialogue with investors. Joining these investor calls going forward is going to be a big part of that, and I am enthusiastic about today\u2019s call. It\u2019s been an incredibly busy couple of months. In addition to executing on our plan and announcing new products and services, I have spent a lot of time gathering feedback and exchanging ideas with customers, partners, employees and investors. It is important and valuable to see the company with a fresh perspective to get grounded both our current realities and future opportunities. As I have told our employees, our industry does not respect tradition, it only respects innovation. This applies to us and everyone else. When I think about our industry over the next 5, 10 years, I see a world where computing is more ubiquitous and all experiences are powered by ambient intelligence. Silicon, hardware systems and software will co-evolve together and give birth to a variety of new form factors. Nearly everything we do will become more digitized, our interactions with other people, with machines and between machines. The ability to reason over and draw insights from everything that\u2019s been digitized will improve the fidelity of our daily experiences and interactions. This is the mobile-first and cloud-first world. It\u2019s a rich canvas for innovation and a great growth opportunity for Microsoft across all our customer segments. To thrive in this world, we will continue to zero in on the things customers really value and Microsoft can uniquely deliver. We want to build products that people love to use. And as a result, you will see us increasingly focus on usage as the leading indicator of long-term success. To that end, we are already making progress. Amy will provide additional detail, but I wanted to say a few words about the quarter itself. Today\u2019s results demonstrate the breadth and strength of our overall business. We saw strong momentum in cloud services. Our commercial cloud business more than doubled year-over-year with Office 365 and Azure both performing extremely well. Business customers continue to make Windows their overwhelming platform of choice, with solid growth in both Windows Pro and Windows volume licensing revenues. We saw continued improvement in search, with our U.S. search share growing to 18.6% and search revenue increasing by 38%. Bing continues to deliver platform capabilities across our products. One recent example of this is the recently announced Cortana virtual assistant for Windows Phone. And very importantly, across all our businesses we continued to have a rigorous focus on execution and cost discipline, resulting in solid revenue and earnings per share. I sum up this quarter in two words execution and transition. We delivered solid financial results and we took several steps to reorient Microsoft. In recent weeks, we talked about how we are advancing Office, Windows and our data platform and how we think holistically about the constituencies we serve IT, developers and people at the center in a mobile first cloud, first world. We will continue to invest in our cloud capabilities including Office 365 and Azure in the fast growing SaaS and cloud platform markets. We are committed to ensuring that our cloud services are available across all device platforms that people use. We are delivering a cloud for everyone on every device. At the same time, we have bold plans to move Windows forward. We are investing and innovating in every dimension from form-factor to software experiences to price. Windows platform is unique in how it brings together consistent end user experiences across small to large screens, broadest platform opportunity for developers and control and assurance for IT. And with the addition of Nokia\u2019s talented people and their depth in mobile technologies we will enhance our device capabilities. The past two and a half months have been a period of significant change at Microsoft, but also a period of nailing the basics and delivering against our product and financial plans. In the months ahead, we will continue to be intensely be focused on two things rock-solid execution and pivoting the company towards the future. We will continue to push hard and move quickly and you will see the proof of that month after month in the products and services we build for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. What you can expect of Microsoft is courage in the face of reality. We will approach our future with a challenger mindset. We will be bold in our innovation. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders. And with that, I will turn it over to Amy to go further into the details of our quarter. And then we will be happy to take your questions after that.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a few things I think are notable this quarter. Then, I will give our outlook before moving on to Q&A. We had a very good third quarter with solid results across our businesses and strong momentum in our most strategic areas. At the same time we remained focused and disciplined in our spending. Total revenue was $20.4 billion, up 8%, and earnings per share grew 5%. We had outstanding momentum and results in our cloud services. As Satya mentioned, Commercial Cloud revenue more than doubled again this quarter. Office 365 is now on an annual revenue run rate of $2.5 billion and Azure revenue grew over 150%, driven by both new customers and increased usage. In our Office 365 Home service, we added nearly 1 million new users this quarter and now have over 4.4 million subscribers. We continued to enhance its value proposition with new features, premium services and cross platform functionality. As we cross the one year anniversary since launch, we are pleased with the renewal rates we are experiencing thus far. With Bing, we made clear progress again this quarter. We grew our U.S. share and improved RPS significantly. Display revenue related to portal and email declined, while we saw ad revenue growth in products like Skype and Xbox. Importantly, we are innovating while expanding our cloud gross margins through both improved scale and continuous engineering efforts to drive efficiency. Businesses are clearly expressing their overwhelming preference for Windows. Windows Pro revenue grew 19% driven by growth in business PCs, mix shift to developed markets where attach is higher, continued strength in the enterprise, and an increased mix of Pro in small and medium businesses. Windows Volume Licensing also had a solid 11% revenue growth. Windows XP End of Support contributed in part to this growth we saw this quarter as did a general hardware refresh. Our commercial results reflect ongoing strength and we again outperformed the enterprise IT market. Customer movement from transactional purchasing to subscriptions and multi-year agreements was better than our expectations. Therefore, our commercial unearned revenue grew 12% this quarter, which was above our expectations and our contracted not billed balance exceeded $22 billion. We had double-digit growth in SQL, System Center, Windows Server Premium and Lync. Clearly, our value proposition and product roadmap is resonating. Xbox One has sold in over 5 million units since launch and engagement has been high with users spending nearly 5 hours per day on their console. We will continue to extend the unique entertainment value proposition of Xbox One, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. where some services aren\u2019t as mature. Xbox 360 sales exceeded our expectations this quarter. And across the platform, Xbox Live members continued to embrace the service with transactional revenue growing 17%. We do expect to work through some inventory in Q4. We continue to enhance the value proposition of Surface through both hardware and software innovation, which makes Surface one of the best high value productivity devices available. This quarter, the mix of sales moved to our second generation and Pro devices. And this change had a positive impact on gross margin. Now, let\u2019s turn to operating expenses. As a result of our ongoing prioritization efforts, OpEx was favorable to what we expected in January. Across the company, we are focused on continually aligning our resources to our top priorities, which includes investing in the next wave of innovation for our customers. We are devoting resources to our sales team and partner ecosystems to ensure they are positioned for the migration to cloud services. And finally, our agility is also improving. As planned, marketing spend was redeployed from Q3 to Q4 in support of a commercial cloud campaign. With that summary of Q3 results, I would like to talk about our outlook. Given the Nokia Devices and Services transaction is closing tomorrow, the guidance I will walk through next excludes any related impact. Let\u2019s start with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects an expectation that the benefits of XP End of Support will moderate. In hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in what is a seasonally slower hardware quarter. This number also reflects channel inventory drawdown for Xbox consoles. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $1.9 billion. We expect to see continued growth in Office 365 Home and Bing as we drive additional usage. Moving on to commercial, we expect revenue across our two segments to be $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion. Within this, we expect commercial other revenue to be about $2.1 billion on the strength of the transition to our cloud. And in Corporate, we expect to defer revenue of about $100 million. We expect COGS to be $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, with variability primarily due to hardware. And moving on to operating expenses. For the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion when adjusting for the prior year European Commission Fine. This represents full year operating expense growth of about 4%. This is on the low end of our original guidance that we provided a year ago of 4% to 6%, as we invested in R&D and sales efforts while rationalizing our marketing spend. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset each other. We expect a higher tax rate in Q4 and the full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. We expect capital expenditure to be about $1.5 billion as we build out our cloud infrastructure. We are concentrating on hardware, software and datacenter optimization and supply chain efficiencies to maximize the benefits of our cloud scale. The benefits of this work are realized in improving gross margins. We expect unearned revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality. Now, let me share some thoughts regarding Nokia Devices and Services. The acquisition will close tomorrow, which is about four months later than the deal economics we outlined in September assumed. Since then, the Nokia business results have also changed. We are focused on the transition from planning to implementation which accelerates with the deal closing tomorrow. Given this is a complex body of work that will take time we do not intend to update our financial guidance for any Nokia impacts during the quarter. However, I want to share the following to help as you update your models. Under the existing commercial agreement between Microsoft and Nokia, license sales and platform payments are reported in the D&C Licensing segment. Once the acquisition closes, results for Nokia Devices and Services will be reported in the D&C Hardware segment. For Q4, we will clearly show the impact of the ending of the commercial agreement, Nokia\u2019s ongoing operations and any one-time integration and severance costs. And we remain committed to achieving annual cost synergy targets of at least $600 million within 18 months of close. Now, looking towards fiscal 15, Satya and I, along with the rest of the senior leadership team are working together to solidify our plans for the year ahead. Our goals are clear get more out of the tremendous resources we have available, drive innovation in products that people love to use and execute in areas where Microsoft can uniquely succeed in today\u2019s mobile-first, cloud-first world. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. And with that we will move to Q&A. Operator please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Question for Satya, just if can reflect on your initial time as CEO and maybe give everyone a sense of how you prioritized your near-term objectives here in the next several quarters that would be helpful? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brent. The first 10 weeks or so have been extremely energizing and as I have said for me what was important to us to reach out, talk to lots of different constituents and relearn the place and see it for the first time and just get a different fresh perspective even in spite of having spent 22 years here it\u2019s been fascinating to get that fresh perspective. And the way I look at it is even from day one I have had this deep conviction that our vision is about being going boldly into this mobile-first, cloud-first world. And we feel that we are well on our way and if there is anything that I want to do is how do we make sure we would remain focused on it with every device launch, with every service launch we keep coming back and reinforcing that vision, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s the purpose with which we approached the vision and the execution behind it which is what counts. And to me being able to think about that deeply what does it means for us culturally, what does it mean for us in terms of our plans. And then just getting behind it, leaning into it as an entire company is what\u2019s my priority and that\u2019s what I obsess about, that\u2019s what I focus about.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Brent. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. Satya welcome on board and thanks for joining on the call. If you don\u2019t mind I am going to ask an overall question either of Amy or of Satya. Looking at commercial license business, how much of the shrinkage year-over-year in commercial license is driven by the move of traditional license players from license or license paying customers from license to the cloud, how much is related to guys moving from software assurance, how much from license, can you give any color on that?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Mark for that question. Why don\u2019t I take that one, overall in commercial licensing I often talk as you know about the commercial business all up, mostly because I think some of the core dynamics really reinforce that we see a bit of what you are talking about, which is that renewal rates have remained high and in line. Our ability to recapture revenue in those contracts remains strong and our ability to attach cloud products has grown. And so what we see in this quarter and what you see even in the commercial licensing line itself is that continued switch. And in fact it was faster this quarter than we had thought. Really, when you look at our commercial on our revenue along with the C&B balance that we talked about last quarter, we have so many billings at the end of last quarter when you really normalized for those in the quarter billings, bookings were also better than we had expected in terms of the annuity stream. So, I think both a transition to long-term agreements is encouraging, the addition to premium product, the addition of new product as well as the transition to a cloud is really core to thinking about the health of the segment all up.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Mark.\nChris Suh: Next question please operator?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Actually, thank you for taking my question guys. And Satya, again, thank you for joining the call, it\u2019s great to have your views and inputs here. One of the questions I get most often from investors is trying to understand sort of how you are going to approach the role and what you are doing initially in terms of is there a strategic review that\u2019s going on? Are you reviewing the businesses? And should we expect any big changes in the strategy of Microsoft? So I am going to pose that question to you, in terms of over the next couple of weeks, months, quarters, even is there anything of a strategic review going on? Is there any big changes in the Microsoft strategy that we should be expecting from that review?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Keith for the question. The framework I have in terms of how I am approaching my job and how we as a leadership team and as a company are going to execute and plan, because one of the things that I strongly believe in is you are planning on a continuous basis, you are executing on a continuous basis. It\u2019s not episodic if you will. The only way we are going to succeed here is by having this notion that you are planning all the time and you are also making the changes to your plan based on the change circumstances. And I think that\u2019s the way to run a company like ours in a marketplace that\u2019s as dynamic as ours. But that said, I start with though a vision that\u2019s very grounded on what the future opportunity is. So this mobile-first cloud-first thing is a pretty deep thing for us. When we say mobile-first, in fact what we mean by that is mobility first. We think about users and their experiences spanning a variety of devices. So it\u2019s not about any one form factor that may have some share position today, but as we look to the future, what are the set of experiences across devices, some ours and some not ours that we can power through experiences that we can create uniquely. So that notion of having a central focus and the central purpose is what, I think we have already signaled and we are well on our way to execute on it. Now you also need to continuously build some new capability. When you think about mobility first, that means you need to have really deep understanding of all the mobile scenarios for everything from how communications happen, how meetings occur. And those require us to build new capability. We will do some of this organically, some of it inorganically. A good example of this is what we have done with Nokia. So we will \u2013 obviously we are looking forward to that team joining us building on the capability and then execution, even in the last three weeks or so we have announced a bunch of things where we talked about this one cloud for everyone and every device. We talked about how our data platform is going to enable this data culture, which is in fact fundamentally changing how Microsoft itself works. We always talked about what it means to think about Windows, especially with the launch of this universal Windows application model. How different it is now to think about Windows as one family, which was not true before, but now we have a very different way to think about it. And so we are well on our way to execute on it, but your core question of are we going to review, we are all of the timing reviewing. And one of the things that I feel as the leadership team we have really picked up the pace on asking the hard questions, what is the believability of any of our plans and pushing ourselves, because at the end of the day to me, I want to be very accountable to you all to our customers, to our partners as a team by executing on our plans very well, because at the end of the day that\u2019s what matters. But so that at least gives you a framework for how we are approaching it.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you very much for that.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Keith.\nChris Suh: Thank you. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Sherlund: Thanks. First Satya on Platform-as-a-Service I am kind of curious how aggressively you plan to maybe change your business model to a subscription model and drive kind of like Adobe did, less upfront revenue, more encouraging subscription and cloud based and whether we should begin to anticipate what it might look like to Microsoft as you make this transition to more of a subscription business, I am just not sure what the margins are on your cloud business. And as you transition most SaaS companies have 70%, 80% gross margins, I am not real sure where you are on your cloud businesses today. Do we think this is going to be a smooth transition or might we expect it to be a little more disruptive as you gain more and more traction on a subscription in cloud basis?\nSatya Nadella: Great Rick. Thanks for the question. I will start and maybe Amy you want to even add. The way I look at it Rick we are well on our way to making that transition, in terms of moving from pure licenses to long-term contracts and as well as subscription business model. So when you talked about Platform-as-a-Service if you look at our commercial cloud it\u2019s made up of the platform itself which is Azure. We also have a SaaS business in Office 365. Now, one of the things that we want to make sure we look at is each of the constituent parts because the margin profile on each one of these things is going to different. The infrastructure elements right now in particular is going to have different economics versus some of the per-user applications in a SaaS mode have. It\u2019s the blending of all of that that matters and the growth of that matters to us the most in this time where I think there is just a couple of us really playing in this market. I mean this is gold rush time in some sense of being able to capitalize on the opportunity. And when it comes to that we have some of the best, the broadest SaaS solution and the broadest platform solution and that combination of those assets doesn\u2019t come often. So what we are very focused on is how do we make sure we get our customer aggressively into this, having them use our service, be successful with it. And then there will be a blended set of margins across even just our cloud. And what matters to me in the long run is the magnitude of profit we generate given a lot of categories are going to be merged as this transition happens. And we have to be able to actively participate in it and drive profit growth.\nAmy Hood: And let me add a bit Rick. I think specifically as you think about the transitions and where you will see it. First, I would say year-over-year we had flat to improving gross margins in all segments but hardware, where we had a mix shift to the Xbox console, which from our business model perspective obviously drives gross margin decline. With that being said, within the Office 365 business, I will start from the fact and a principle which is having a user whether they be in the consumer or in the enterprise have access to our most recent, most innovative, most secure product which is always going to be for us probably the one born in the cloud will be a driver of satisfaction and a driver of usage. Those two things lead to revenue. You are already seeing that transition in the enterprise where we already sold that way. The transition is quite easy from an economic standpoint. In the transactional business you saw the impact of it this quarter. We had a bigger mix shift to annuity more went on the balance sheet. We still had strong growth, but you do see the impact inter-quarter. And in the consumer side of the business which you also referenced with Adobe, I think we have just launched another SKU in addition to Home called Personal as we continue to drive consumer usage that way. The launch of Office on the iPad is an example of where we will add the most value which is in the subscription.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Rick. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you. And Satya I will echo everybody\u2019s thoughts but it\u2019s great to have you on the call and share your perspective. I was wondering if you could share with us the decision recently to offer Windows for free for sub 9-inch devices and how you think this impacts your share in that arena? And also how should we think about Windows pricing, given your comment about how Windows is going to kind of play in different market segmentations, how do we see Windows pricing evolving, if at all, for other types of form factors over time?\nSatya Nadella: Overall, first of all, thanks Heather for the question. Overall, the way I want us to look at Windows going forward is what does it mean to have the broadest device family and ecosystem? Because at the end of the day it\u2019s about the users and developer opportunity we create for the entirety of the family. That\u2019s going to define the health of the ecosystem. So, to me, it matters that we approach the various segments that we now participate with Windows, because that\u2019s what has happened. Fundamentally, we participated in the PC market. Now we are in a market that\u2019s much bigger than the PC market. We continue to have healthy share, healthy pricing and in fact growth as we mentioned in the enterprise adoption of Windows. And that\u2019s we plan to in fact add more value, more management, more security, especially as things are changing in those segments. Given BYOD and software security issues, we want to be able to reinforce that core value, but then when it comes to new opportunities from wearables to internet of things, we want to be able to participate on all of this with our Windows offering, with our tools around it. And we want to be able to price by category. And that\u2019s effectively what we did. We looked at what it makes \u2013 made sense for us to do on tablets and phones below 9 inches and we felt that the price there needed to be changed. We have monetization vehicles on the back end for those. And that\u2019s how we are going to approach each one of these opportunities, because in a world of ubiquitous computing, we want Windows to be ubiquitous. That doesn\u2019t mean its one price, one business model for all of that. And it\u2019s actually a market expansion opportunity and that\u2019s the way we are going to go execute on it.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, thank you.\nChris Suh: Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn DiFucci: Great, thank you and welcome Satya. I am going to give Amy a question here for numbers. Amy, we see our sales and marketing expense declined 7% year-over-year in this quarter. Can you remind us if there is anything unique last year or is this just better controls? And along these same lines free cash flow, excluding acquisitions grew 2%, which is a bit of a surprise, given the direction the company is going and the first time in seven quarters we have actually seen growth in free cash flow. So, can you tell us how we should be thinking about this going forward?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, John. I was getting lonely. I didn\u2019t have any questions. So I appreciate it. Let me start with your first one, which was there any sort of unique thing that resulted in that comparable in sales and marketing. We didn\u2019t have more a launch expense going on a year ago, but we also focused on rationalizing and focusing our marketing dollars in quarter. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s a combination of both. And I would probably say more of the latter, which is really thinking and prioritizing more effectively throughout the year to earn the highest ROI on the dollars we are spending. We also did invest in sales year-over-year. So most of that is specifically around marketing, so I want to make sure that you understand that where we see opportunity, we are investing in our selling engine to get it, which is, I think an important caveat to make sure is clear when you see year-over-year sales and marketing decline. The second half of that, in terms of cash flow, I think as we remain focused on prioritizing and really thinking about the return on the dollars we spend, you did see also as I talked about earlier margins increase year-over-year. All of that had a positive impact on cash flow.\nJohn DiFucci: And going forward, should we \u2013 how should we be thinking about that, just continued discipline I guess around expenses, but also investment where it\u2019s needed?\nAmy Hood: Yes, I think when we talked at the end about how I think about \u201815 maybe it\u2019s a better set of how we think about everyday, which is what can we do today, this week, this month to better invest behind places where we feel like we are uniquely capable of success and not being afraid to make those changes and finding the agility and the empowerment here to do those things is incredibly important. And I would say culturally Satya mentioned about being more data driven. I think in addition to the day-to-day, which was more focused on customers, I think really it\u2019s a cultural statement about how we are going operate more internally as well. And so maybe that\u2019s the most forward-looking comment I could tell you which is that being empowered to look weekly, monthly and see how we can get better and better and better. And I think that\u2019s actually driven a lot of excitement around here.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay, great. Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks John. We will move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Winslow: Hi. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter and Satya great to have you on the call as well. I wanted to focus in on Office 365 I mean if you compared this quarter to last quarter you added 1.1 million Home Premium users, last quarter I think it was 500,000. In September you talked about run rate of I think $1.5 billion, now you are $2.5 million. I wonder if you can just talk about the momentum that you are seeing in Office 365 and maybe give us your thoughts on sort of business versus the home/consumer side of that. And then Amy when you think about Office 365, how do you think about the difference in sort of lifetime value of an Office 365 customer versus a traditional Office user?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start and then Amy you should definitely add on to it. Office 365 I am really, really excited about what\u2019s happening there, which is to me this is the core engine that\u2019s driving a lot of our cloud adoption and you see it in the numbers and Amy will talk more about the numbers. But one of the fundamental things its also doing is it\u2019s actually a SaaS application and it\u2019s also an architecture for enterprises. And one of the most salient things we announced when we talked about the cloud for everyone and every device and we talked about Office 365 having now iPad apps, we also launched something called the enterprise mobility suite which is perhaps one of the most strategic things during that day that we announced which was that we now have a consistent and deep platform for identity management which by the way gets bootstrapped every time Office 365 users sign up, device management and data protection, which is really what every enterprise customer needs in a mobile-first world, in a world where you have SaaS application adoption and you have BYOD or bring your own devices happening. So to me the Office 365 growth is in fact driving our enterprise infrastructure growth which is driving Azure growth and that cycle to me is most exciting. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why I want to have to keep indexing on the usage of all of this and the growth numbers you see is a reflection of that.\nAmy Hood: And Phil, specifically to some of your \u2013 how do we think about the lifetime value, maybe I will use the consumer actually SKUs which you started with as a good example. First, whenever we launch a new machine, a new SKU in this instance especially a subscription. I do think it takes some time both for the customer to understand the value proposition as well as the retailers and partners to really hone their motion, to pivot, to selling a new subscription model I think you are starting to see some of the acceleration as well as increasing awareness of the product which I think is terrific. And maybe more importantly as we think about the value we are adding the Office on the iPad announcement certainly brought attention as we continue to drive people to the subscription. And I made a comment around renewal rates and we are happy with them as we have just sort of passed the one year anniversary of the launch. And I think when you look at the LTV we will be better off for many reasons including financially. When a person moves to the subscription, my deep belief is the most important thing we will do is continue to think about how we can modernize, add features, add innovation so that it\u2019s more valuable to them everyday they use it. And that is far easier in a cloud world than it is on premise. And so I think that\u2019s probably the most important driver of LTV long-term.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks guys.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Phil.\nChris Suh: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Amy, just a question for you. I know you\u2019re not providing updated guidance for Nokia. I\u2019m just wondering maybe a little bit of thought behind that decision, I know the deal closes tomorrow, you probably could easily move things around here a bit and reported on early next week and how that benefit? Is the lack of guidance there, is it just simply you haven\u2019t been able to get your hands into that business at this point? Is there something else that changed in that business? Just trying to get a sense because it does sort of open up quite a bit of variability in terms of how people are going to model things over the next three months?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Walter. It really wasn\u2019t a choice. The reality is we\u2019ve not had the type of access on tool close where we could confidently begin to give the type of guidance that I believe we have come and you have come to expect from us in terms of the depth and analysis required to get there. They do report the different accounting system; it needs to be converted to GAAP. We\u2019ve not had access to forward projection; I haven\u2019t had a deep access to their system and so until we get that which really starts tomorrow. It\u2019s not really a question of whether it was this week or next week, it\u2019s really a question of us getting the confidence and access to be able to report at the level of details I know you all would expect me to do.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Walter. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes, hi thanks. I\u2019d like to focus on that server product revenue number of 10% and Satya I think you know a thing or two about this group so perhaps I\u2019ll direct that to you. But that growth rate is so far still above what a lot of your mega-cap tech vendors, peers I should say are posting. And I just wanted to ask you if you could try to outline for us the couple of factors that have enabled Microsoft to continue growing that server business well above your peers? And secondly if you think that kind of 10% ish growth is sustainable over fiscal 2015?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Karl. So I\u2019ll start in fact both Amy and I looked on that business. So we\u2019ll both take a crack at it. It\u2019s a pretty exciting change that\u2019s happening, obviously it\u2019s that part of the business is performing very well for a while now, but quite frankly it\u2019s fundamentally changing. One of the questions I often get asked is hey how did Windows server and the hypervisor underneath it becomes so good so soon. You\u2019ve been at it for a long time but there seems to have something fundamentally changed I mean we\u2019ve grown a lot of share recently, the product is more capable than it ever was, the rate of change is different and for one reason alone which is we use it to run Azure. So the fact that we use our servers to run our cloud makes our servers more competitive for other people to build their own cloud. So it\u2019s the same trend that\u2019s accelerating us on both sides. The other thing that\u2019s happening is when we sell our server products they for most part are just not isolated anymore. They come with automatic cloud tiering. SQL server is a great example. We just launched a new version of SQL which is by far the best release of SQL in terms of its features like it\u2019s exploitation of in-memory. It\u2019s the first product in the database world that has in-memory for all the three workloads of databases, OLTP, data warehousing and BI. But more importantly it automatically gives you high availability which means a lot to every CIO and every enterprise deployment by actually tiering to the cloud. So those kinds of feature innovation which is pretty boundary less for us is breakthrough work. It\u2019s not something that somebody who has been a traditional competitor of ours can do if you\u2019re not even a first class producer of a public cloud service. So I think that we\u2019re in a very unique place. Our ability to deliver this hybrid value proposition and be in a position, where we not only run a cloud service at scale, but we also provide the infrastructure underneath it as the server products to others. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth. The shape of that growth and so on will change over time, but I feel very, very bullish about our ability to continue this innovation.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.\nEd Maguire: Hi, good afternoon and it\u2019s great to hear you Satya on the call. I had a question about the device and consumer licensing. First of all the Windows Pro revenue is very strong and Amy I know you had alluded to receding impact of XP upgrades, but I wanted to get a sense of how sustainable you think that growth can continue? And also noticing that the particularly Office Consumer revenue is improving on attach rates and there had been a bit of a disconnect there because of the transition to Office 365. Wanted to get your thoughts on how long that might be sustainable or whether this is related to sort of the broader XP expiration? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Ed. Let me take those in reverse actually. On the Office Consumer performance I will always first and foremost think about the combination of Office 365 Home as well as our consumer performance. And that grew obviously at a higher rate than 15% that we talked about this quarter that and increasing attach. There were some dynamics this quarter that I think were important. Some stabilizing that we\u2019ve seen in the consumer developed world PC market also benefits as you might imagine our Office business. We have the highest attach rates in developed markets and so that tends to be an important driver of Office revenue whether earned as a license or as a subscription. The second thing is related a bit to your first question. These are \u2013 it\u2019s sort of hard to separate oftentimes made the dynamics in our market. As we\u2019ve seen Pro, Windows Pro mix increase, for example in small business, when people buy PCs with Windows Pro they\u2019re more likely to purchase a form of Office whether it would be a subscription or a license. That\u2019s another dynamic you saw this quarter. A final dynamic that I\u2019ll talk about relating to Office was around Japan. We did see some pull-forward due to the tax increase and so that did have an impact on Office Consumer growth, but even without that as we talked about we still had increasing attach and very good performance for the quarter. Now backing up because it\u2019s complicated was the Windows sustainability and in the business segment. As we said it\u2019s very hard to separate cleanly the impact of XP from what is an improving business PC refresh cycle as well as some positive macro-economic trends that we\u2019re seeing. So as I said my comments \u2013 the end of XP does create a bit of a moderation in growth. That being said the differentiation and value proposition of Pro is clearer than it has been. The investment in that SKU and the value proposition of Pro has had mix increasing within segments of the market. For example in small business and in the enterprise for people who buy Windows PC. And so I think that\u2019s an important dynamic that we\u2019ll continue to invest in and we\u2019re excited to say.\nEd Maguire: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Ed. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thanks for taking my question. Question for Satya as we think about the new world in terms of more usage and more software driven rather than device driven. Can you talk a little bit how you want to reengage or further engage with the developer community with the big theme of your presentation at Build? I noticed (indiscernible) submarine was kind of mentioned by a lot of guys and saw a lot of attention. But talk a little bit about that, how the developer community is really important for you and what you\u2019re doing around that to kind of get the software future of Microsoft going again?\nSatya Nadella: Great. So thanks for the question. Developers are very, very important to us. If you\u2019re in the platform business which we\u2019re on both on the device side as well as on the cloud side, developers and their ability to create new value props and new applications on them is sort of likes itself. I would say couple of things. One is the announcements we made at Build on the device side is really our breakthrough worked for us which is we\u2019re the only device platform today that has this notion of building universal apps with fantastic tooling around them. So that means you can target multiple of our devices and have common code across all of them. And this notion of having a Windows universal application help developers leverage them core asset, which is their core asset across this expanded opportunity is huge. There was this one user experience change that Terry Myerson talked about at Build, which expands the ability for anyone who puts up application in Windows Store to be now discovered across even the billion plus PC installed base. And so that\u2019s I think a fantastic opportunity to developers and we are doing everything to make that opportunity clear and recruit developers to do more with Windows. And in that context, we will also support cross platforms. So this has been one of the things that we have done is the relationship with Unity. We have tooling that allows you to have this core library that\u2019s portable. You can bring your code asset. In fact, we are the only client platform that has the abstractions available for the different languages and so on. And then on the cloud side, in fact one of the most strategic APIs is the Office API. If you think about building an application for iOS, if you want single sign-on for any enterprise application, it\u2019s the Azure AD single sign-on. That\u2019s one of the things that we showed at Build, which is how to take advantage of list data in Sharepoint, contact information in Exchange, Azure active directory information for log-on. And those are the APIs that are very, very powerful APIs and unique to us. And they expand the opportunity for developers to reach into the enterprises. And then of course Azure is a full platform, which is very attractive to developers. So that gives you a flavor for how important developers are and what your opportunities are.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks Raimo. Operator, we have time for one more question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss MacMillan: Thanks very much for taking my question as well. Amy, I just wanted to go back to D&C licensing, because I think the guidance for the next quarter suggests a relatively modest decline at the midpoint, certainly more modest than we saw prior to this quarter for the last few quarters. And I guess I have two questions. One is, are you able to separate the XP End of Life impact from the broader improvement in corporate PC refresh, for example? And then two, Satya, what thought have you given around how you could potentially make what has been traditionally a unit model with Windows OEM revenue into something potentially more recurring in nature? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Ross. Let me take the first part of that. I think our guidance for the D&C licensing segment takes into account a moderate decline as I said in the benefit of the end of XP as well as some of the impact of the pull forward in Office for Japan. So I think in general, it\u2019s pretty reflective of the trend lines that we discussed. And I do think it is hard to really separate completely the difference between a general and the improving business PC environment and the end of XP. We tried our best to do that in the guidance and we will obviously learn more over the coming weeks.\nSatya Nadella: And the thing I would add is this transition from one time let\u2019s say licenses or device purchases to what is a recurring stream. You see that in a variety of different ways. You have back end subscriptions, in our case, there will be Office 365, there is advertising, there is the app store itself. So these are all things that attach to a device. And so we are definitely going to look to make sure that the value prop that we put together is going to be holistic in its nature and the monetization itself will be holistic and it will increase with the usage of the device across these services. And so that\u2019s the approach we will take.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Ross.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Ross. So thank you all. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events generally webcast and you could follow the events at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need additional details. And thanks again for joining us today.\nAmy Hood: Thanks everyone.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Before I hand the call over to Amy, please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferrals and recognition related Windows, Office, and Xbox video games. As a reminder, with our new segment reporting structure, we have consolidated adjustments of this nature into \u201ccorporate and other\u201d to provide better comparability of operating results. You can find details of the adjustments and a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck. And with that, I will turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. As I look back on the quarter, I am pleased with the results, as we exceeded our expected revenue growth while continuing to maintain our focus on improved execution and cost management. Our devices and consumer segment had a very good quarter and grew 13%, with a successful holiday. Our commercial segments had another great quarter, and grew 10%, to over $12 billion, as we continue to deliver on our differentiated cloud strategy. We performed well this quarter, and you see it in our financial results. This holiday, we continued to make significant progress in the consumer space, headlined by Xbox One, which launched in 13 markets and sold in 3.9 million units in just over five weeks. According to NPD Group figures, Xbox One was the leading console in the U.S. for the month of December, which was its first full month in market. When adding in Xbox 360, which held the third spot, Xbox led the U.S. market, with 46% share in December. We are excited by this enthusiastic response from our loyal customers, and are working to increase the availability of Xbox One. With Surface, demand continued to grow, benefitting from improved execution at retail and favorable reviews of the new Surface devices. Sequentially, both units and revenue more than doubled this quarter, with customers recognizing Surface\u2019s differentiated value proposition as one device for everything in their life. We feel good about the progress we have made over the past couple of quarters, and are enthusiastic about the overall opportunity ahead with Surface. The Windows ecosystem as a whole is also making important progress. Earlier this fall, we launched Windows 8.1, which enabled smarter, faster, and more personalized devices, and our OEM partners are taking advantage of this. Over the last few months, they\u2019ve delivered a breadth of differentiated devices designed to meet a wide range of customer needs. We\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish with our partners and collectively, we will continue to focus on driving the Windows ecosystem forward. Now, let me share some perspective on what we saw in the PC market, which was slightly better than our expectations. Business PCs grew again, for the third consecutive quarter, and benefited from an improving macro-environment, better availability of innovative new hardware, and a refresh cycle ahead of Windows XP end of support. Additionally, growth was higher in large enterprises than small and medium-sized businesses. Consumer PCs, while better than our expectations, continued to be soft, as they face challenges from competing form factors. And, as a general theme, developed markets outperformed emerging markets. Windows continues to be the platform of choice for business. This quarter, Windows Pro revenue grew 12% and outpaced the underlying business PC market. This was driven by faster growth in both enterprises and developed markets, where Pro attach is higher. Windows non-Pro revenue, however, was down 20%, reflecting the dynamics of the consumer PC market. Now, let\u2019s move to our commercial business, where key metrics remain strong. Bookings grew 12%, and renewal rates remained in line across our product portfolio, even with a large expiring base in the quarter. Unearned revenue grew 12%, and our contracted, not built balance is at a record level of over $23 billion. To me, this is important, as these long term commitments demonstrate the confidence that customers have in our product roadmap, where we are investing in key areas such as big data, infrastructure management, and cloud computing. In big data, our upcoming release of SQL Server 2014 builds on the momentum we established. Offering a complete business intelligence solution for big data, SQL Server is driving significant in-memory performance gains. Additionally, it enables hybrid cloud solutions with cloud backup and disaster recovery, as well as providing enhanced availability and security. Hybrid infrastructure and management offerings also continue to be important priorities. Windows Server, Azure, and Systems Center are the centerpieces of our hybrid cloud strategy, and together they enable portability and scalability of workloads. Using our suite of products, customers get high scale virtualization, built-in software defined networking, and hybrid business continuity that enables their modern data centers. As CIOs look to cloud computing to reduce costs and deliver business agility, they are turning to our cloud services. Office 365 and Dynamic CRM Online offer customers the ability to transition easily to the cloud and benefit from enterprise class features and a familiar user interface. Additionally, Windows Azure provides the scalability and flexibility that addresses their evolving infrastructure and platform needs. In summary, we had a very good quarter across our consumer and commercial business. We are taking share with many products, and seeing improvements in areas where needed to be better. As we do this, we continue to prioritize the deployment of our resources to areas that accelerate innovation and deliver products that our customers love. With that overview of the quarter, I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on our outlook.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. First, I\u2019m going to review our overall results, and then I\u2019ll move on to the detail by reporting segment. We had a successful holiday quarter, and our broad, diversified portfolio helped us deliver record revenue in Q2. Total revenue was up 11% to $24.5 billion, and without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been higher by $196 million, or 1 percentage point. Cost of goods sold increased 46%. This increase was primarily due to costs associated with the new Xbox and Surface products, which launched this quarter, and also growth in [unintelligible] infrastructure supporting our consumer and commercial offerings. Even as we invest in our devices and services initiatives, gross margin was flat at $16.2 billion. Operating expenses grew 3%, which was below our guidance, and we continue to focus on prioritizing spend for strategic growth initiatives. Operating income and earnings per share both declined 4% to $8 billion and $0.78 respectively. This quarter, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, our highest amount in the last 12 quarters. I\u2019m now going to talk through the performance of each of our reporting segments. In our devices and consumer segment, revenue grew 13%. Within this, the licensing segment, which primarily includes Windows OEM, consumer Office, and Windows Phone, declined 6%, reflecting the overall PC and device market trends. We continue to see similar dynamics to the previous quarter. Total Windows OEM revenue declined 3%. As Amy described, the 12% growth in Windows Pro was offset by 20% declines in Windows non-Pro. Excluding the impact of China, where we continue to draw down inventory levels, Windows non-Pro revenue declined 14%. Office attach, including our cloud offerings, was up again this quarter. Traditional consumer Office licensing revenue declined 24%. However, we estimate that approximately 16 percentage points of this decline was due to the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. Excluding this impact, traditional consumer Office outperformed the underlying consumer PC market. Next, I\u2019ll move to our hardware segment, where revenue grew $1.9 billion or 68%, driven by a good holiday quarter for our consumer devices. Xbox One had a record launch, and together with Xbox 360, we shipped 7.4 million consoles. For Surface, we saw improved sales of Surface RT and also introduced Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 into the market. Moving to the devices in consumer other segment, as a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium, and other consumer products and services. Revenue in this segment declined 10% when compared to last year, when we launched Halo 4. Search advertising revenue grew 34%, driven by continued revenue for search improvements and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries to 18.2% in the U.S. Office 365 Home Premium adoption continues to be strong. With this service, customers are always running the most up to date version, have content available across their devices, with SkyDrive innovation, and get free Skype minutes. The overall value proposition is resonating well with customers and we now have more than 3.5 million subscribers. For the quarter, it accounted for more than 15% of total consumer Office licenses sold. Turning now to our commercial segment, [unintelligible] commercial revenue and gross margin across both on premise and cloud services grew 10%. The commercial licensing segment, which reflects our traditional software licensing, grew 7%, and our commercial other segment, which captures our commercial cloud services as well as our enterprise services business, grew 28% to $1.8 billion. As the economies of scale benefits accrue to these online services, we\u2019re seeing gross margin expansion in our commercial other segment. We saw continuing strength across our commercial portfolio. Server product revenue grew 12%. In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets tier one application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue for Systems Center grew double digits, and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, gained 5 points of share over the last year. In our data platform business, SQL Server continued to outpace the market, and revenue grew double digits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 25%. Our commercial Office products also remained strong, growing 10%. Within this, our productivity server offering, SharePoint, Exchange, and Lync continue to perform well, with Lync growing over 25%. We\u2019re excited about the unified communications opportunity, as we combine the enterprise richness of Lync and the global reach of Skype to transform the communications experience. We\u2019re pleased with our momentum in cloud services. This quarter, revenue for commercial cloud services again grew over 100%, as customers of all sizes continue to leverage our cloud services to improve productivity, reduce costs, and leverage a secure and trusted platform. We are seeing broad-based adoption, as Office 365 seats, Azure customers, and Dynamic CRM net seat adds all grew over 100%. We now have 70% of the Fortune 500 companies using at least one of our cloud services. Having now reviewed our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-looking guidance.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Chris. Before I get into our expectations for the quarter, let me quickly touch on Nokia. We continue to expect that the deal will close this quarter, but are still in the process of securing all regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions. So all guidance provided here assumes no impact from Nokia. Assuming the deal closes this quarter, we will include Nokia in our guidance starting in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are expecting a similar macro-environment to what we saw this quarter. As such, many of the dynamics from the second quarter will likely continue into the third. With that, let\u2019s get into the outlook, starting with devices and consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the second quarter, with business PCs growing, strong Pro mix, and headwinds in consumer PCs. In hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This reflects continued post-launch momentum with Surface 2, Surface Pro 2, and Xbox One, with the upcoming launch of the Xbox exclusive game, Titanfall. And in devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion. Moving on to commercial, in what is a seasonally slower quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue to be the vendor of choice, with our productivity and infrastructure offerings. In commercial licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.4 billion to $10.6 billion. In commercial other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion, reflecting continued momentum in our commercial cloud business. We expect COGS to be $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily reflects variability associated with our hardware business. Moving on to operating expenses, we expect opex to grow 5% to 6%, to $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. We are also reducing and narrowing the range for our full year guidance to $31.2 billion to $31.5 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We still expect our full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6 billion, which is down about $500 million from our prior guidance. This reduction is primarily driven by improved capacity utilization and scale benefits, as we converge our online services infrastructure platforms while continuing to support the strong demand that we see in business. Adjusting for prior year tech guarantees and product referrals, we expect unearned revenue to sequentially decline as it has in prior years. So, in summary, I feel good about the financial results this quarter. We are executing well across the company, as demonstrated by share gains in our commercial business, but we are also making important inroads with our consumer offerings. Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about, as we continue our transformation around One Microsoft. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Chris and we\u2019ll take your questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. And with that, we\u2019ll move on to Q&A. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JP Morgan Chase.\nJohn DiFucci: Obviously nice upside on the hardware business with Surface and Xbox. But my question is on the licensing business. So bear with me a little bit here. You had both licensing businesses, devices and consumer, and commercial licensing, they were both better than expected, at least by about $100 million each. At the same time, deferred revenue was shy by something like $250 million. But there\u2019s some conflicting things, and I\u2019m just trying to get my head around this. Contracted not billed, Amy, you pointed out was really strong. You saw a big jump, by somewhere around $2 billion sequentially. And you also saw some nice traction in the commercial cloud services. It more than doubled, assuming it\u2019s small. So here\u2019s my question. With all that happening, is there a shift happening with your on-premise corporate business to more transactional versus ratable contracts that would sort of help to offset the financial implications as you shift to cloud services on the corporate side? Is that what\u2019s happening with all these movements?\nAmy Hood: I really appreciate the question, because it\u2019s going to let me help expand on a couple of dynamics, which I think are at work here. So now I\u2019m going to ask you to bear with me, with a little bit of a long answer. Let me start by your comments, I think, around the overall commercial licensing bucket. I\u2019m going to expand to include, as you did, the overall commercial business, both cloud and licensing. There are a number of metrics that I tend to look at together as opposed to individually, to think about how we did in the quarter. You touched on one, unearned, which grew 12% this quarter, which is quite good. The second is bookings, which grew 12% in the quarter, which is very good. Renewal rates, which were in line across our products. And finally, the CNB balance, the contracted not billed balance, being up sequentially $2 billion, as you point out, is very big. If you think about those together as a group, those data points are very important because together, I think you said a couple hundred short on unearned, with those data points together, I would say there\u2019s no shortage in terms of commercial licensing and commercial other strength all up. As you know, contracted but not billed tends to be at the end of the quarter. We\u2019ve signed a bunch of contracts that we can\u2019t bill for until the very beginning of the next. Think about that as business done in quarter. You\u2019ll see that come into the unearned balance, frankly, in Q3, as well as into adjusted. So that dynamic answers really the first question, and the part of the question you asked. That\u2019s sort of a separate piece. Then you said, well, some of the dynamic could be explained by some strong transactional business in the quarter. And I would actually separate these things, because the first was good and the second was better than we thought. Office non-annuity, or transactional, did a little better than we thought in quarter as well, and so that\u2019s a good point that we didn\u2019t bring out, that that is another component of the 10% all up commercial growth. Now, so, I guess my answer is, I agree with your transactional comment, but I disagree that it\u2019s probably that it\u2019s a component of a \u201cshortfall in unearned.\u201d I would say both are actually quite good.\nJohn DiFucci: That\u2019s fairly helpful, but just a clarification on the contracted not yet billed. And yes, contracts get signed at the end of the quarter. So you\u2019re saying that the big jump primarily was because they just hadn\u2019t been billed yet. I could see if you were just signing longer term deals, that you\u2019re going to bill annually, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening? Either one could happen.\nAmy Hood: That\u2019s right. If something was actually billed at the end of the quarter, it goes into unearned. Contracted but not billed is actually that the contract was signed, but that because the billing won\u2019t quite take place until after the end of the fiscal quarter, it ends up in contracted but not billed as opposed to unearned.\nJohn DiFucci: Typically, your contracts are three years, but are we seeing any extension on the average contract length?\nAmy Hood: No. That\u2019s not one of the impacts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford C. Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Two quick questions. The first one is can you give us any sense of how much of the Office 365 and the Home Premium could be generated by net new users as compared to simply the move over of existing users?\nAmy Hood: Here\u2019s how I think about the value proposition, because I can\u2019t really say, these are sales through retail and [unintelligible] generally, whether it\u2019s a net new user or not. What I can say is that attach overall went up in the Office consumer business, which I would say is, and could be, a sign that some of those are net new. And I would hope that to be the case. The value proposition of Office 365 Home Premium really does expand the footprint. It allows for multiple users, it has cross-platform capabilities with Office for Mac, it\u2019s got mobile capabilities as well, and allows for easier trial. So it does sort of lower many of the barriers to experience and try the product. So while I can\u2019t point and say there\u2019s an exact number that is a new user, I can certainly say with attach going up, that dynamic is helpful.\nMark Moerdler: The second quick question is on the Windows side, we\u2019ve seen obviously an improvement on the numbers on here. Do you believe that\u2019s being driven purely by an improvement going on on the market, it\u2019s the Windows 7 refresh accelerating as we get closer to the day? Any sense of what the drivers are, both on the consumer and the enterprise side as to why we\u2019re seeing the pickup?\nAmy Hood: I covered it a little bit in my comments, but it\u2019s probably worth spending a little bit more time. Let me start with the business market. I think there really are three factors that I would point to, particularly in the business environment. And the first one may also help on the consumer side. The overall macro spending environment is better. It\u2019s a little better than we thought, and in businesses we\u2019re seeing it, you\u2019re seeing it in some of the IT spend forecasts you all put out. They\u2019re being raised, and I think that has an impact. The second is I think our partners have done a very good job expanding the types and availability of new and interesting hardware. That brings people to the store, and I think it\u2019s an encouraging sign. And finally, as you asked, is the end of life of XP. That has been an impact, and we expect it to continue to be, as we said, in Q3. But I wouldn\u2019t point to simply one of the factors as being the reason, but it is a combination of those factors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Just have a question back on that Windows volume licensing side. You kind of touched on it earlier, but you saw 10% growth year over year this quarter versus 6% last quarter. So you continue to have very healthy growth. One of the questions I\u2019ve been getting from some clients is A) what\u2019s driving that, and B) as we get closer and actually pass the official end of life of XP, how do you think that\u2019s going to affect the growth in Windows licensing beyond that point?\nAmy Hood: I\u2019m going to take the opportunity to make your question two questions. One, to just talk about Windows volume licensing overall, and secondly, allow me to talk a little bit about the places that you can see the impact of Windows XP in the current quarter. And I think that will help as you think about Q3 going forward. In volume licensing, you\u2019re right, it did grow 10% in Q2. And we do believe we are seeing some of the benefits of that growth is the end of life of Windows XP. But it\u2019s also reflective of the value many of our bigger customers are seeing in upgrading to the enterprise version of Windows. The enterprise SKU includes things like Direct Access, Windows to Go, Corporate Image, App Blocker, and those really are differentiating. And they really do matter to many CIOs. So I think specifically on VL, while end of life on XP is one component, it\u2019s certainly not the only component. Now, if I expand your question to sort of - and I think in a way Mark asked about it too - is the end of life of XP. One place that we\u2019ve talked about it was Windows, and how does it play into the business PC growth. The second we talked about was volume licensing. And the third was actually talked about in John\u2019s question, with Office and some transactional strength. Some of the strength that we saw in Office transactionally really can be linked back to the end of life of XP. As people refresh a PC, and if they\u2019re buying Pro, those people often are Office customers, and so if they tend to buy on a transactional basis, we also see some impact through Office. I think you can tie that back to some of the outperformance we saw in the quarter as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Amy, I wanted to ask if you could share with us how you see the gross margin profile of the company changing, as you continue with your journey to be a devices and services company. And as you look out to when the transition is complete, and I know you probably don\u2019t know when exactly that\u2019s going to occur, how do we think about what it will look like?\nAmy Hood: This is one of those questions that I think is best taken in a bit of a chunk. First of all, I think if you look at our commercial segment, I\u2019ll do it all up, because I think it\u2019s relatively easy with that breakdown. In general, and you saw it this quarter, even if we continue to invest in the infrastructure to support our cloud conversion of our commercial customers to Azure and Office 365 and CRM Online, our actual gross margin remains flat, which means we\u2019re increasing our utilization and growing gross margin in the commercial cloud business as we continue to see traction. Over time, I continue to believe our commercial business, in the absolute, moving to the cloud is a net positive, as I talked about before, to overall profit, including the increasing amount of gross margin we make as a company. So, I think this quarter was 83%-ish, so that, I would take as a separate bucket from our devices and consumer business. And there, what\u2019s interesting is we have a couple of business models there, with different gross margin profiles. And you\u2019re actually seeing the impact of some of that in this quarter. Xbox, as we know, especially with new consoles like the One, tends to be gross margin negative on the front. This is a heavy quarter for that over time, for the attach. First, second, third party games and other services, the margin profile with any console [unintelligible] changes. But it\u2019s never going to be an 83% gross margin. It\u2019s just a different business, even for the market leader, and even successfully generating cash and returns. That is different from other businesses we also have in D&C. So I think the important thing that I tend to focus on as I go through all these businesses is continued margin improvement within the business, continued efficiency within the business, and continued focus on the absolute profit within each of those areas. And then the mix then becomes more of a math equation, as we continue to grow the overall amount of cash and profit the company generates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.\nBrent Thill: Just back on contracted not billed, you had four quarters of over $21 billion and then jumping up obviously north of $23 billion. That jump that happened, can you just help us understand the buckets that made that jump this quarter? Is there an easier way to think through where that actually came from?\nAmy Hood: Yes and no, of course. Let me say, contracted but not billed is related to the number of expirations we have in the quarter. Chris and I both talked about, we did have a lot of expirations in the quarter. When those tend to fall at the end, it can impact the actual magnitude, the actual number of expirations, and then the timing of when those fall in the quarter can also impact how it\u2019s recognized. And that\u2019s why I never really look at it separately from unearned, bookings, and renewals together. Because timing is one thing, that\u2019s why I tend to put them in a bucket and say, together it\u2019s a good and healthy trajectory.\nBrent Thill: And just real quick, on the multiyear agreements, you mentioned healthy renewals. Any color you can add to the re-up on the size of what you\u2019re seeing in general across some of those bigger multiyear agreements?\nAmy Hood: I think in general it reflects the same trends we\u2019ve been seeing across our broad portfolio. You see it across Windows, Office, and Server. If you look at our KPIs, I think that points out that it\u2019s pretty broad based. So I don\u2019t think there is any on particular area I would call out. It\u2019s really more about platform health and commitment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.\nWalter Pritchard: Question on the consumer retail side. This is the first year I think you\u2019ve had a full retail store presence. You also, I believe, had some presence in some of the Best Buys with sort of mini stores in there. And I\u2019m wondering what your takeaway is from the holiday season, and if those efforts you think were part of the reason why you had a pretty successful season, especially on the PC side, and what that experience suggests that you should do in future in terms of retail store buildout and general investment around retail.\nAmy Hood: When we talk about improved retail execution, I really think that\u2019s a partnership, as you said, with retailers, with our OEMs, and with our efforts to really improve both the devices, the assortment, and the experience of buying in the PC aisle. So I do feel good about the investments we\u2019ve made there, and we\u2019ve made them, I think, thoughtfully, and continue to keep a focus on cost and expense as we do that. So do I think it had an impact? I do. But I really think the broader impact was investments and commitments we had with our partners to also improve the retail buying experience.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: I wanted to dig into gross margins in the quarter, because by my estimates, you guys outperformed guidance for gross margin that you gave in the quarter, despite the fact that you saw significant outperformance in D&C hardware, which, as you were saying, especially for something like Xbox One, which is just out of the gate, you had expectations of being very low, if not negative gross margins. Can you help us understand a little bit of where that gross margin outperformance came from? Was any of it in D&C hardware, getting better yields, better gross margins, on those products, and your expectations? And if not, where did the outperformance come from?\nAmy Hood: I\u2019m glad you asked that question. With our outperformance, as you pointed out in D&C hardware, we did actually see increased COGS related to that. However, that was offset by some COGS improvements and savings we saw across other areas, as we continue to focus on efficiency and execution. And so you\u2019re right, we did see COGS grow with hardware, but we were able to find savings elsewhere as we focused on improved execution.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.\nRick Sherlund: Congratulations on the margins, cost management, and execution, and also Amy, I think we all appreciate your very substantive answers to the questions. Just a follow up to an earlier question on the contracted but unbilled. We\u2019re seeing VMware that they had a surge of three-year contracts coming out of the recession, and a lot of those are coming back for renewal now. Is that what you were suggesting, is you\u2019ve got an unusually large volume of contracts coming up for renewal?\nAmy Hood: Yes. In many ways, you\u2019ve seen this over covering our company for a while. Expirations can be chunkier. That\u2019s not a year statement. This quarter we had a big expiry base. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as abnormally large, but the timing is a bit related to three years ago, and the timing of some of the contracts. So it\u2019s probably a consistent driver.\nRick Sherlund: And last quarter we talked a bit about are there any metrics you can help us to understand better what the effect of your revenues is from the shift to the cloud. I think on Office, it\u2019s more of a net delta that I think you said it hurts you about $150 million in the previous quarter. Is there any way you can give us a sense for what the net impact is on the business from the shift to the cloud?\nChris Suh: I talked about this a little bit. The place where you can see the most direct impact is in the consumer Office business. We talked about the business, on a traditional license basis, being down 24 points. But our estimate is approximately 16 points of that decline is accounted for by the shift to Office 365 Home Premium. So that gives you sort of a good estimation of the direct impact we\u2019re seeing, particularly on the consumer side.\nRick Sherlund: That implies it would only be down about 8%, were it not for the shift to the cloud?\nChris Suh: That\u2019s one way to look at it, yeah. The net number would be about 8%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.\nEd Maguire: I wanted to ask about phone, because you had not discussed Windows Phone on the call so far. Just how it\u2019s tracking based on your expectations, whether you are planning to continue to invest with non-Nokia OEMs? And also, whether any of your expectations or investment plans for the integration with Nokia have changed in any meaningful way since you announced the deal?\nAmy Hood: It\u2019s a good point. We didn\u2019t have a chance to discuss the phone results. We did see growth in Windows Phone, both in the licensing and in the mobile phone IP revenues. Both grew this quarter. And we continue to see the growth in many of the places we\u2019ve seen historically, so unsubsidized markets, as well as with entry level smartphone devices. So I think many of those dynamics haven\u2019t really changed. Do I have any updates to how to think about Nokia? Other than we continue to expect it to close in the quarter, I don\u2019t. We mostly remain focused on working hard to get to the point where we\u2019re working together as one team to drive that business forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\nKash Rangan: I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re trying to improve the margins in each of the commercial and consumer businesses, but the margin differential between these two businesses still is a pretty wide one. It looks like the consumer business is growing. The three dynamics I can see are, the margin differential is too wide. You\u2019ve tried to improve that, the margin is still wide. The consumer business trend-wise is growing faster than commercial. And third is that you have this shift to the cloud. So unless you do something like an Adobe or Autodesk, where you force the transition to happen very quickly, there\u2019s the risk that you get a lot of growth, which is fantastic, and there\u2019s a lot of progress to share, but the margin inflection point could be delayed for several years. I think that was one of the questions that was spurred behind, presumably, Heather\u2019s question. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at. So how long are you going to get this shift to results in a way that we may not see the earnings growth rate, but we may have to wait until some point in time? Or are you at the point where you can actually force the shift to happen much quicker?\nAmy Hood: The way I think about it is we have a broad portfolio, and we address customers of all types, and in many ways, our biggest goal is to meet the needs of our customers, whether they be CIOs or consumers. And setting our business model to support the products and the adoption curve that we want needs to be married with the adoption curve and timing of our customers. I feel like we\u2019ve done a very good job of balancing the pace of that. I\u2019ve been encouraged by the pace of adoption of many of our cloud services. You heard premium numbers today, as well as talking about the commercial cloud. And so for me, it\u2019s hard to say, is there too big of a delta. It\u2019s really about managing each of these things toward absolute growth and absolute improvement, and having customer adoption. So I probably just have a different perspective on that than you have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.\nRoss MacMillan: Amy, you said that Office 365 Home Premium was more than 15% of total consumer Office licenses sold. And I wonder, if you think about your commercial business, and we either think about it as a percentage of total Office 365 or as a percentage of maybe what\u2019s traditionally been transactional, whether you have a similar metric in terms of percentage of total Office licenses sold.\nAmy Hood: That\u2019s a good question. You know, we only recently started selling the Office client in our volume licensing agreement through a subscription. So that is actually good feedback for us to think going forward about talking about the Office specific business that way. Because in general we think of Office 365 as being a broad set of assets, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and Office in the commercial business, and we haven\u2019t really talked about it, given the newness of the model and the enterprise as being as meaningful as it has been in the consumer. The shift is far faster there, on the client.\nRoss MacMillan: Yeah, I just think that would be helpful, especially if you think about it with respect to your traditional commercial transactional business. Maybe if I could slip in one other one, just to go back on the contracted not billed. I just want to be clear in my own mind, because I\u2019ve heard two things. One thing I heard you say was we had stronger transactional business late in the quarter, but I also heard you say that there were frankly more renewals on multiyear that would have resulted in that balance going up, especially if those were late in the quarter. So am I right to think it\u2019s those two factors that are at play here, both stronger transactional and a larger pool, if you will, of multiyear renewals? And is it relatively evenly balanced between the two?\nAmy Hood: Actually, transactional execution in the quarter is recognized all in quarter. That\u2019s not annuity. It doesn\u2019t go to either the unearned balance or the contracted not billed balance. So that\u2019s not an impact that results in a change to the unearned or CNB. The latter, which is the absolute size of the expiration base, frankly could or couldn\u2019t impact CNB. It can impact things like unearned growth, but it also can impact CNB, depending on if it is contracted in quarter, but not billed until after the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Amy, in the Q it talks about the Surface still losing money, even at the almost $900 million run rate of revenue in the quarter. Can you give us any sense of what kind of volume you need for that business to have the scale to make some money?\nAmy Hood: You know, when we launched Surface just a year ago, our goal was really to create a product that showcased what can happen when you innovate in hardware, in the service, and in the software. And as you know, we\u2019ve learned a lot over the course of this journey. And we have to make more meaningful progress. But I think for us we\u2019ve remained focused, as we launch the second version of Surface, to stay focused on both price points and gross margin, and I think we\u2019ve made a big leap from v1 to v2, and I\u2019m looking forward to making leaps as we go forward in our product roadmap. But I do think it\u2019s more to think about it as a goal we absolutely have, as we continue to innovate the line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.\nGregg Moskowitz: Amy, despite the healthy gross margins, your Xbox platform revenue grew $1.2 billion year over year, but your related cost of goods sold went up by $1.6 billion. And I realize there may be additional costs related to launch, but just wondering if you could talk to expected profitability levels for Xbox for the balance of fiscal \u201914.\nAmy Hood: We\u2019ll continue to be in launch mode for Xbox One, especially many people are excited about the launch of Titanfall in March, and we\u2019ll continue to add and expand markets over the course of the year. So I would continue to think about our investment in being the leading next-generation console as certainly extending.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\nBrendan Barnicle: Amy, you mentioned briefly in your comments some of the strength you\u2019d seen in SQL Server, and that seems to be taking market share. You highlighted a couple of the features, but what do you think is driving that market share gain? And a similar question over on the server side, where you seem to have better server numbers than what we\u2019ve seen in units? And what would be accounting for that additional strength?\nAmy Hood: You\u2019re right, I only pointed out a few of the value propositions of SQL Server. And actually, dating back years, the real value proposition of SQL has been the breadth of its offerings: analytics, reporting, and core database functionality. And so over the years, I think the balance of those things, and continuing to add and innovate at very good value, has continued to be appealing. And as we move forward and add some cloud capabilities to our hybrid model, and continue to add features into the premium levels, when you\u2019re the established, and I think in many ways unit leader, then you can focus on continuing to move up the stack, adding value, and increasing your premium mix. And the team has really done a terrific job of doing that, so it\u2019s nice to be asked, so that I can talk about it. And I mentioned it briefly, Systems Center is another where we\u2019ve gained share in virtualization, and I think we\u2019re quite proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, especially in that area, and that\u2019s enabled a lot of growth as well. So I actually appreciate the question. It\u2019s good to be able to talk so positively about those assets.\nChris Suh: Okay, so that wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call.

Before I hand the call over to Amy, I would like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, please keep in mind that with our new segment reporting structure, adjustments for items such as upgrade offers, tech guarantees and presales are consolidated into corporate other to provide a comparison of operating results. Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferral related to the Windows upgrade offer, Windows 8 presale, the Office offer and a $113 million revenue deferral in the current quarter, primarily related to Windows 8.1 presale. You can find details of adjustments and reconciliations of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck. With that I will turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. By now you had a chance to look our press release, earning slide deck, key performance indicators and our 10-Q. Our results have been reported using the new reporting framework I first discussed in our financial analyst meeting in September. Since this is a new way to think about our business, I am sure you will have a lot of questions, so after our prepared remarks, we will allow a little more time than usual for Q&A. With that, let me dive right in. This quarter, we delivered record first quarter revenue. We did it while working through a significant affirmation of our organization and while making significant move to implement our new strategy. Our company is focused and delivering. Our enterprise business remained strong despite a macro environment that some had characterized as tough. We are driving our business forward with industry-leading solutions in the areas like collaboration, unified communications and cloud services, and high customer satisfaction is driving high enterprise agreement renewal rate. At the same time, we are making meaningful progress in our consumer business. We saw growing engagement and adoption across our major consumer services, including office 365 Home Premium, Skype, Bing and SkyDrive. With the new Windows, we are building high value experiences for our consumers that allow people to use our devices and services all day long whether at work or at home. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad based revenue growth. Overall both, developed and emerging markets showed strengths. The U.S. and parts of Western Europe were particularly strong, while China was weak. Now, let me share some quick thoughts on the PC market which turned out better than we had expected. We are seeing signs of stabilization in the business segment with two consecutive quarters of growth and a relatively stable outlook for the next couple of quarters. While the consumer segment is more volatile with increasing competition for share of wallet and also performed better than expected, particularly in developed markets. With that backdrop, let's move onto Windows. We are seeing favorable reviews and customer enthusiasm for Windows 8.1, which became available last week. Windows 8.1 delivers on Microsoft promise of a quick innovation cadence launching less than one year after Windows 8. Based on extensive customer feedback, we added more customization capabilities, made the UI simpler and easier to use, added new and smart ways to search, improved power management and allowed multi-tasking, even on a tablet. Combined with the progress our OEM partners are making, we are collectively increasing the selection of compelling windows devices available to meet the dynamic needs of all segments of the market. This holiday, we will see competitive opening price points on tablets and laptops, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 for less than $300. We will also see exciting mobile devices from six inch phones to 10 inch tablets, many with Microsoft Office. In the six inch category, we are incredibly excited by the Nokia Lumia 1520 tablet announced this past Tuesday. For eight inch tablets, Toshiba, Dell, Lenovo will have devices available for less than $300. And for 10 inch tablets, we of course like the Nokia Lumia 2520 with LTE. In addition to third-party devices, we are also excited about our first-party lineup. With Surface, we are making progress with better end market executions. As a result, we more than doubled the number of units we sold over the prior quarter. In terms of mix, Surface RT did better than expected. With Surface Pro, we saw some customers delay purchase in anticipation of Surface Pro 2 which delivers significantly improved battery and processor performance. Moving on to the enterprise, where demand for our solutions continues to be strong. Earlier this month, we announced our fall wave of enterprise products and services, which touches nearly every aspect of IT. We are seeing solid growth. We are outperforming our competitors and we are taking share in areas like virtualization and the data platform. Our hybrid infrastructure and management offerings continue to be tough choices for CIOs with Windows Server Premium and System Center growing double digits again in this quarter. The latest versions of Windows Server, System Center and Windows Intune deliver enhancements in networking, storage and device management for Windows and alternative platforms. These enhancements will help customers realize the promise of hybrid cloud computing across their data centers, hosted clouds and Windows Azure. In the data platform, SQL Server continues to outpace the market. The next version, SQL Server 2014, will offer new in-memory and cloud capabilities that will increase performance and unlock new hybrid scenarios. Later this month, we will make Windows Azure HDInsight, our Hadoop-based the Big Data solution generally available. We continue to bring additional value to the Windows Azure platform. This quarter, delivered a number of updates that enable faster connectivity, improve security and integrate access and identity across on-premise and cloud application. With all of the innovation we are delivering to our enterprise customers, we continue to be uniquely positioned to capture more and more of the addressable market. Before handing it off to Chris, I would like to say a couple of additional things. As part of our new reporting framework, we have disclosed segment gross margin. The segment breakout is important in understanding our performance because each of our businesses are impacted by the different dynamics and have different margin profiles. In devices and consumer, the sequential change in gross margin dollars reflects the progress we are making towards our strategy of delivering a compelling family of devices and services. While we feel good about the increased traction we saw with Surface this quarter, we know there is more to do. We are intensely focused on improving our capabilities in key areas like demand-planning and supply chain management and on achieving scale as quickly as possible. In commercial, we are already seeing the benefits of the investments we have made to transform our business model from perpetual software licensing to services. In our commercial cloud business, which includes Office 365, Azure and other Microsoft services, we saw year-over-year gross margin expansion. With regards to our pending acquisition of substantially all of Nokia's devices and services business, we still expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar 2014. We will provide an update to the EPS impact, if any, post-closing. So in summary, we are executing better, getting our customers what they want and making meaningful progress through the early stages of our transformation. And we have accomplished all of this while also working through the One Microsoft realignment and several significant announcements. We are committed to executing and delivering and so far that's what we have done. With that backdrop for the quarter, I will hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on the outlook.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. First, I will review our overall results and then I will move on to the details by business segment. Total revenue was up 7% to $18.6 billion and came in at about $700 million better than our expectations. Without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been $200 million or one percentage point better. Annuity revenue was particularly strong and grew 11%, driven by commercial performance. Cost of goods sold increased 23%, which was in line with our expectation of over 20% growth. This increase was primarily due to service cost and also higher depreciation related to the CapEx investments we made this quarter for cloud services strategy. As a result, gross margin grew 3% to $13.5 billion, reflecting the changing mix of our revenue. All up, operating expenses grew 8%, which was generally in line with our expectations with the exception of G&A, which declined due to lower legal expenses. We continue to be thoughtful and diligent in how and where we focus our resources, in advertising, the [keynote], embraced One Microsoft and the benefits are already accruing with improved messaging and results. In R&D, we are continuing to focus our resources while accelerating our cadence. Operating income and earnings per share, both declined 3% to $6.4 billion and $0.63, respectively. Unearned revenue grew a healthy 14% to $20.1 billion and our contracted not billed balance grew to over $21 billion, driven by commercial strength. Our inventory balance sequentially increased by $675 million, mostly due to build the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Ahead of holiday selling season, Xbox represents over half of our inventory balance. Inventory for Surface products declined sequentially even as we built levels ahead of this week Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 launches. This quarter, we announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend to 28% and also announced $40 billion share repurchase program. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, our high quarterly amount since the second quarter of fiscal 2011. I am now going to talk about the performance in each of our reporting segments. Our devices and consumer licensing segment is comprised principally of Windows OEM, consumer office and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing. Our Windows OEM business performed better than expected, declining 7% versus our expectation of a mid-teens decline. As Amy noted, we believe we are seeing stabilization in business PCs, which grew again this quarter and drove Pro revenue growth of 6%. We also saw better than expected performance in the consumer part of our business. Non-Pro revenue declined 22%, but with several points better than expected. Excluding the impact of China, which continues to have a different dynamics than other emerging markets, non-Pro revenue declined 17%. Together with our OEM and retail partners, we brought an incredible breadth of Windows devices to market. We have also made meaningful improvements to our advertising campaigns which now clearly highlight the value proposition of our devices. As we head into holiday, we are excited by the opportunities to bring the new Windows experience to even more users around the globe. Consumer Office licensing revenue declined this quarter. The financial impact of the shift to Office 365 Home Premium was generally in line with our expectations. Office 365 subscribers benefit from the natural integration of services such as SkyDrive and Skype and have the flexibility to access the service from numerous end points. Whether via traditional licensing or subscription, customers continue to see the value in Office and overall attach of Office increased this quarter. The Windows Phone ecosystem is seeing sustained growth. While we have work to do, our share is growing in many geographies, the device portfolio is expanding and the number of apps available in the marketplace is increasing. about Ubuntu our devices and consumer hardware segment, where revenue grew $401 million, driven almost entirely by Surface. With improved sales and marketing effort, combined with pricing and promotional activities, we saw Surface units and revenue growth sequentially from Q4, with the mix of sale shifting towards 32 gigabyte RT device. Demand increased for this device both, in retail and in education. From a gross margin perspective, in addition to product costs, which grew as a result of increased Surface sale, we also incurred non-product expenses as we readied inventory line for the new Surface lineup in the holiday sales cycle. Moving to devices and consumer other. As a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studio, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and services. This quarter revenue growth in this segment was driven by both an increase in advertising revenue and also volumes in our online marketplaces. Search advertising revenue grew 47% driven by continued revenue per search improvements and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries in the U.S. to 18%. Gross margin declined slightly due to higher royalty costs and also infrastructure cost growth as we expanded geographic footprint of our services. Turning now to our commercial business. With all up commercial revenue across both on-premise and cloud services grew 10% this quarter. Notably even as we invest for growth, we saw gross margin expansion in our commercial cloud business. Across our commercial portfolio, we saw healthy renewal, a continued shift to premium products and strong adoption of our cloud services. Our enterprise cloud strategy is resonating with customers and server product revenue grew 12%. SQL Server revenue grew double-digit with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 30%. Our commercial Office products also remained strong and grew 11%. Within this, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync collectively grew double-digits with Lync growing nearly 30%. Helping to drive this demand for our Server and Office product is deployment of hybrid cloud solution. This quarter, revenue for our commercial cloud services grew over 100% as services such as Office 365, our innovative Azure services for comprehensive cloud solution. Importantly, we are seeing strong customer adoption with Office 365 seats and Azure customers both growing triple-digits. Dynamics CRM Online is also expanding its base, with two-thirds of new Dynamics CRM customers opting for the cloud. With that overview of our Commercial business, let me share the financial performance in each of our Commercial reported segments. Revenue in the Commercial Licensing segment grew 7% and in our Commercial Other segment, revenue grew 28% to $1.6 billion. As a reminder, Corporate and Other is where we consolidate adjustments for tech guarantees, pre-sales and the like. In the comparable quarter of last year, we had aggregate deferrals of $1.4 billion for Windows and Office and this quarter we deferred $113 million, primarily related to Windows 8.1 pre-sale. Having now talked through our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward looking guidance.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Chris. As we look towards the second quarter, we are assuming the macro environment remains generally the same. With this, we expect many of the dynamics we saw in the first quarter to continue with strong performance in our commercial business and ongoing improvement in our consumer business. Importantly, we are set up for a terrific holiday season. We will have a wide variety of Windows-based devices in market. Earlier this week, we launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, and in November, we will launch our next generation console, Xbox One. Building on the performance and unique experiences that gamers love, it will also deliver an innovative entertainment experience by bringing movies, music, sports and live TV together in one place. With that, let's get into the outlook. Starting with Devices and Consumer. In Licensing, we expect revenue to be $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we expect the business PC market to be stable, however, the consumer PC market is subject to more volatility. In Hardware, we expect revenue to grow 35% to 45% to $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, reflecting the expanded Surface line up and the much anticipated Xbox One launch. The 10 percentage point range reflects variability in device unit volumes. In the consumer hardware business, such variability is not uncommon, especially during launches and the holiday season. In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Search revenue should continue to grow reflecting improved revenue per search and query volume. As a reminder, in Q2 of the prior year, we launched Halo 4, which contributed $380 million of revenue to this segment. Now, moving onto Commercial. We expect revenue to grow 9% to 11%, in line with the first quarter. As we think about this part of the business, we are confident in our ability to continue to add value to our products while providing low total cost of ownership for our customers. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion, with similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. This includes healthy renewals and strong annuity revenue growth from volume licensing with Software Assurance. In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting ongoing momentum in our commercial cloud business and enterprise services. As CIOs increasingly look to capitalize on the opportunities of cloud computing, we are confident they will continue to look to Microsoft for their IT solutions. Moving on to cost of revenue, which we expect to be $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily relates to the unit variability assumed in hardware revenue. In Surface, we are still in the early stages of the lifecycle. As you know, there are many things that go into bringing hardware to market, including both variable and fixed costs. We are intensely focused on building volumes and achieving scale to cover these costs and get to profitability. As you think about the economic model for Xbox, you should keep in mind that console margins are just one aspect of the overall platform's financial performance. Attach with games, accessories and Xbox LIVE services, also contribute to the economic model. We expect the launch of Xbox One to be the biggest in Xbox history and we feel great about our ability to continue our leadership position in the living room. Moving onto operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 6% to 8%, to $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We also reaffirm our full-year guidance of $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion. We continue to invest in innovative experiences for our customers while remaining focused on expenses. We still expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6.5 billion, even though we only spent $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Given the nature of the investments, there is variability from quarter-to-quarter due to our success based approach as well as the timing of delivery and completion. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be between 18% and 20%, depending on our geographical mix of earnings. When adjusting for tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to be roughly in line with historical trends. In summary, I am really pleased with our results this quarter. It was a great start to the fiscal year as we executed and delivered across all of our businesses. We are on track with implementing the transformation of the company around the One Microsoft strategy, and at the same time are not missing a beat in executing faster. As we look forward to the second quarter, our enterprise business will remain strong and we are also set up for a fantastic holiday season with Surface, Xbox One and a host of devices from our partners, which will allow us to reach new customers and drive increased engagement. With that, I will turn it to Chris and we will take your questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. With that, we are going to move on to the Q&A. Operator, please go head and repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Amy, Chris, thanks for the additional details. I know everyone appreciates the forward looking details. My question is on the commercial revenue, obviously an impressive number in a seasonally soft Q1. Your guidance assumes also a continued good trajectory. Maybe if you can walkthrough why you think you are outgrowing your peers and what has led to this double-digit number?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent, for that question. When I think about the commercial business and focus on our unearned revenue growth of 14%, plus our bookings growth, which was quite strong as well, 6%. I think about the roadmap. The strength of the commitments the customers are making, is really forward-looking. It's a three-year commitment to the Microsoft platform both, to our cloud and on-prem solutions, the breadth and strength of that roadmap and our offerings, and in many ways that's what gives us the confidence that we are outperforming our peers. Also I it speaks a lot to the innovation in the roadmap we have shown, whether it's for Azure, Office 365 or our broader Server, what's the word, portfolio. I do feel quite good about both our competitive position and our ability to execute. I think we did a great job in the field this quarter, remaining focused on delivering what we needed to deliver to our customers and we were quite pleased.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Brent. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, guys. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to focus in on Xbox and Xbox platform. Amy, I wonder if you could give us maybe some color on how it performed this quarter, but in particular as you look into the December quarter here, obviously, you gave that gross margin guidance. But I was wondering if you could talk high level about how you are approaching the Xbox One launch play versus Xbox 360, from a perspective of how you are pricing it relative to COGS and just how the build of Xbox One looks versus 360?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Phil. I think it's a great question that gives me the opportunity to talk about the breadth of the portfolio that we will have to offer at holiday. And then talk a little bit about the gross margin profile and philosophy we have about those products. We are excited that we will have a great value offer at holiday with Xbox 360 and we will also have a great choice with our innovative Xbox One platform to really give us a good breadth rolling into holiday of selections across price points. We did, with Xbox One, make a decision to really enable a first-class experience out of the box. There's Kinect, there is a headset and there is the console. And depending on where you are around the globe, there may be a game included as part of bundled per geographic interest. As I have said, the best way always, to think about the life value of the Xbox plan is over its lifecycle. I am excited about the increased opportunity that Xbox One allows us to attach more and different services beyond what we have historically thought of it as simply a gaming platform and when I think about the opportunity going forward, it is important in Q2 to realize that will impact our growth margin in the short-term but winning the platform at holiday and our positioning to do that allows us to grow profitability in a far different way over the lifecycle. So hopefully, that helps.\nChris Suh: Great, Phil. Thank you. Let's move on to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase. Thank you. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks. Amy, billings were about what we modeled for the quarter but deferred revenue was about $700 million less than we expected anyway, which was equal to the upside in revenue. So I am just curious, did you end up recognizing a greater portion of revenue upfront this quarter than you normally would? Because like I have realized, given how you recognize revenue, I guess the question could be said, was the transactional portion of the revenue in the Commercial segment greater than it is typically this quarter?\nChris Suh: Hi, John. This is Chris. I am going to jump in a little bit and let me Amy add on. I think the way to think about, the way we think about it is, we did see growth across annuity and non-annuity in the business. But also the changing dynamic is the mix of the dollars that are going into unearned revenue. As we build more contracts in some of our subscription offerings, that also changes the nature of the term. If you think about one-year subscription offerings and things like this, that has a little bit of effect on unearned revenue balance as well.\nAmy Hood: Let me add a little bit. I would have said, John, both of those things you said are true and both are good, which is I do think our unearned balance growing 14% year-over-year was better than we actually had expected, from our perspective. And we also saw very good non-annuity performance within the quarter, particularly in Office and in SQL which, I think, are very good signs, we believe, for both to see the strength broad based. As you know the annuity portion tends to be related to large customers making long-term commitments, some of the non annuity is exciting, but it tends to be smaller customers who have decided to go ahead and upgrade to the most recent version of Office, which is also encouraging.\nChris Suh: We will move to the next question please, operator.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Wong: Hi, guys. This is Ken Wong for Walter. I guess, we wanted to focus a bit on Windows, and the OEM business was down just 7% this quarter versus down 15% last quarter and what seemed like you guys had a lot of pressures on ASPs and what not. What drove sort of the quick turnaround from quarter-to-quarter? Maybe if you could just dig in a little bit there.\nAmy Hood: Let me try to break it up a little bit, Ken, to make sure I understand and get a chance to talk about the overall performance. Business was better than we expected, so actually ASPs were probably higher than many people had modeled and than we had expected, due to mix Growing 6% in the Pro segment was both, better than we expected and probably better than many people had considered. In the Consumer segment, the minus 22, taking out China to minus 17, I think is generally overall you take those two numbers probably in line with most of the device level estimates for PCs we have seen across the industry and from some of our peers reporting into system. I do think, we were impacted by some inventory levels. It did come down a bit actually this quarter as well, so I think overall we do think that things were probably more stable in the business segment and encouraging and then consumer and developed markets particularly were better than we had seen.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Ken. Yes. Next question please. Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. You saw a real market uptick in the advertising revenue, with the search advertising revenue. Any particular accounts you could point us to and sort of what really canalized that part of the business and how sustainable that's going to be on a go forward basis?\nAmy Hood: Sure. Thanks, Keith. A couple of things. It was or going to - as you noted both by RPS improvements and volume improvements which is encouraging. I also think underlying matters some real technical improvements we made within the search engine, algos are better and the investments we are making are really allowing us to monetize at a higher level. We also saw some strength in a few other geos, which helped increase the performance there, so I do believe that that trend we expect to continue into 2Q.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nChris Suh: Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini: Hi. Great. Thank you, Amy and Chris. I just was wondering, you talked about the entry of a lot of new SKUs that are coming out for the holiday season. As we start thinking about building our OEM models, how do we think about for ASPs for this eight-inch and below category that you referenced there is a lot of product coming out with?\nAmy Hood: Good question, Heather. Let me talk about first the importance of the breadth of the offers that we are putting into market. With Windows 8.1, one focus we had was to expand both, the opportunity for screen sizes and to reach new price points and to cover really from the smallest to the largest with touch and non-touch. I think our ability to work with partners and some of the sales execution we have seen in the fields has led to have a broad opportunity at retail for holiday for devices. It is important. I do hope in some ways, this is a question that's a bit awkward. You always want to say ASP. It's good to have ASPs go up. Transparently going forward as we make more progress, especially in the smaller screen sizes, we should expect units to go up and be very excited about that in terms of share, but ASPs would trend down. I don't think that will have a material - our guidance does not assume a material impact to ASPs in Q2, but over the long-term I actually do understand the question and would expect ASPs to be on that trend line assuming we are successful in those lower end device sizes.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you very much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Heather.\nChris Suh: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. And Amy, thank you, of course, for giving so much more data in guidance. We appreciate it. A couple of quick attached questions. You had said that the consumer Office last quarter was going to be down roughly 5% lower than the PCs due to the move to subscription. You said the attach was higher this quarter. Should we think that the dip was roughly in line with that?\nChris Suh: Yes. Hi, Mark. This is Chris. Let me try to clarify the numbers, just so we are all on the same page. So we did say consumer Office did decline this quarter. Last quarter, you were right, we said about 5 points of impact. So the impact indeed was about what we expected but with the increase in attach, they tended to offset each other in the end. So the numbers came in pretty much as expected. So I think that's the right way to think about it.\nMark Moerdler: Okay, perfect. That makes sense.\nAmy Hood: Of course, I can't let Chris, I am going to add a little bit to the answer. Sorry. Mark, I do think it's important for us to continue to reiterate the importance of the success of the Office 365 Home Premium SKU from a strategic standpoint. We have done a very good job and I would say, as a mix percentage of the SKU, it continues to do even a little better than we had hoped in terms of execution at the endpoint and driving value. While that does have an impact on the initial ASP of the SKU, the long-term lifetime value of that product, in my belief, given the always up-to-date, first to see innovation, use across multi-endpoints, inclusion of Skype, inclusion of SkyDrive, really does allow for a higher lifetime value and ultimately a happy customer. So I really am encouraged by our progress and our execution there.\nMark Moerdler: Beautiful. One other quick question. Any sense for what Commercial Licensing would have been if not for the move to cloud and subscription? Does it make a material change yet at this point?\nChris Suh: No. The best way to think about that, Mark, is if you look at, it's not an exact offset, but when I talked about the Commercial business all up, I gave the construct around products like Commercial Office, Commercial Server as all up across both prem, on-prem and Commercial. So we talked about Office growing 11% across both Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other in aggregate. If you look at the specific segment, you will see that Office in the Commercial Licensing segment actually grew 6%. So you can see that we are having outsized growth in the Commercial Other segment which is Office 365. So that, maybe, helps at least dimensionalize the size of the growth in relative term.\nMark Moerdler: Perfect. I really appreciate it. Thank you, both.\nAmy Hood: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.\nRick Sherlund: Thanks. Just to follow-up on Mark's question. I believe there was a slide at SAM that showed about $150 million of negative impact in the quarter from the move to the cloud which, in and of itself, it's about 1% of revenue. So it's kind of not a very big deal. And I think most of that was from Office versus Server and Tools. So if you say it's about as expected, I guess I am just looking for some clarification here. Is the really only impact we are seeing in the Office segment versus Server and Tools or is there much impact in that part of the business from the move to subscription.\nAmy Hood: Rick, let me clarify. The $150 million, you are right. It was actually just related to the consumer Office segment and had no broader connotation beyond that. So that $150 million in a quarter on consumer Office actually does have a meaningful impact to the gross of that especially versus PCs. So that being said, obviously, if we talked about the momentum in our broad Office 365 revenue, it is a bigger impact across not just Office, because I think that's actually not the way of thinking about Office 365 impact. There it's really around Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and the board Server impact there is actually more meaningful than its impact on maybe Office clients on the commercial side.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Macmillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss Macmillan: Thanks a lot. I have two questions. Just first on the Device and Consumer Licensing business. Your forecast for Q2 suggest some moderating decline and I was curious as to whether on the corporate OEM side, if you will, that's just a reflection of the ongoing stabilization trend or do you also expect to see improvement on the consumer OEM side? Related to that, how do you think about the impact of the end of life of XP on the corporate OEM side? Do you think that the improvement is completely unrelated to that end of life forthcoming or do you think there could be some impact related to that? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Great. Let me divide that question. I think and you said two parts. Our Q2 guidance for devices and consumer licensing, really says that the trends we saw in Q1 on both sides continue in Q2, so I think that's an important distinction as you noted and asked for clarification on, so I hope that's helpful on that component. When it comes to end of life of XP, I tend to think about that more on the VL side as well and the strength there which will be in the commercial reporting segments. We continue to make progress on the XP install base and now a little over 75% of the PCs are running 7, so I do think as we continue to get to end of life of XP, you will see the impact more on the VL side of the business than you would in the device and consumer licensing segment.\nRoss Macmillan: Thank you very much. It's helpful. Maybe one quick follow-up? Just on the Office business overall in the Commercial segment. If you think about units, whether licensed or 365, when you just think of the aggregate pool of units, you sort of alluded to it before, but did that perform in line with your expectation or was it actually slightly better on a unit basis? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: It was slightly better for Office, the best way of taking about that from a unit perspective.\nRoss Macmillan: Thank you very much. Congratulations.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ross. We will take next question please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.\nEd Maguire: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the conditions in China in a little bit more detail, not just on the consumer but also in the commercial as well as what your expectations might be given the lifting of the ban on game consoles for Xbox there, and also if you could just address what you are seeing in terms of your commercial cloud adoption outside of the U.S. Thank you.\nChris Suh: I will take the first part of the question, so yes as I said on the call, the macro conditions in China, which is I think consistent with what some of the other companies that reported as well have been challenging. Our total revenue across all of our business, including PC related businesses were down year-over-year and I think that's overall impacting our results in China all up. I think the second part of your question was related to? Sorry, can you repeat your second question.\nEd Maguire: Sure. Well, I was wondering about Xbox expectations there, but also the trends of commercial cloud adoption in areas outside of the U.S.\nAmy Hood: We haven't really talked specifically about our expectations for China on the Xbox, but let me take the second half of that question. Our performance in both, Office 365 and Azure has actually been quite good both, in the U.S. to your question and outside the U.S. Part of the reason that you have seen us investing on the capital expense side is to continue to build out the opportunity set, because we are seeing good demand outside the U.S. As you think our ability to be competitive there is just as high as it is here, so we have already seen that growth.\nEd Maguire: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Great. Thanks, Ed. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Maynard: Good afternoon. I wanted to drill a little bit into how you are thinking about holiday on the consumer hardware side and specifically just expectations around Surface, and then also any insight or color you think in terms of what your expectations are with RT versus Pro? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Jason. I think, overall, for holiday, given our guidance, we clearly do expect a healthy holiday performance across the portfolio. I say that because we do have offerings that provide great value from having Surface V1 RT still in market, Surface 2, Surface 2 Pro plus Xbox 360 plus Xbox One really does provide both a value portfolio and those who want the latest and greatest experience have something covered. The guidance does include good performance across all of those product lines. We did see, I think as Chris and I both talked about, a lot of progress in sales execution on Surface, in particular this quarter. And that does give us more confidence about our ability to execute again well in Q2. In particular, as you know, our RT did do quite well this quarter. And I look forward to seeing that continue with the Surface 2 device as well in holiday.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Jason. We will move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much for all the details as well. Maybe my math skills have gotten horribly weak, but I just took the mid-point, Amy, of your revenue guidance for the different line items and also the mid-point of your cost of revenue inputs and the midpoint of your OpEx and I comp with what looks to be about a 10% reduction to where, I think, most sell-side models or maybe I am hoping that I did something wrong here, but if that's the case, I get about 29% op margin relative to the 33% or so that you did last year. So can you just walk us through what are items that you are assuming in your cost structure which effectively makes the op income flat, although you are getting good revenue growth rate. I just wonder if there were any one time items or if it's just emblematic of a shift in your business model devices and consumer, especially with Nokia going forward? Wonder if we should not be thinking about op margins but really op income growth rate? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Kash. I think the one thing I would urge you to do, as you think about the guidance we gave, is looking specifically at the D&C Hardware guidance as well as making sure you are mapping the COGS very specifically to whatever assumption you are making in D&C Hardware, given the business model of Xbox that can and will have an impact in Q2 to the overall gross margin structure. So as you think through that, I think that's probably one of the assumptions that it may sound like using the midpoint could lead you a bit off, off of where I would have expected.\nKash Rangan: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Kash.\nChris Suh: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-on from Jason's question earlier on. Can you talk a little bit about where you see the improved success and the sales execution success on the Surface? Is it kind of Commercial? Is it Consumer? And what's driving the improvement there? And how much is the improved revenue run rate, also driven by the fact that the channel needed to be ready for the holiday season? Thank you.\nChris Suh: Hi, Raimo. Thanks for the question. As we talked about, especially for this last quarter, Surface, we saw two things I will mention which is popularity of the Surface 32 gigabyte RT device. That one was more successful this last quarter. And we actually saw demand increase in both commercial and in the education customer segment as well. So we did see some improvement across both of those segment.\nAmy Hood: Yes, I would say that another way is that, it was in retail and in education was where our RT performance.\nChris Suh: Yes, sorry. I meant actually -\nAmy Hood: So I just want to make sure that was clear. It really was better execution at retail and in edu and I still look forward to building a commercial channel which we are just starting to do as we continue to add resellers to our model.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks so much because I had two quick ones. One was, the SQL Server success continues to be very impressive particularly relative to the field. So I am wondering where you are seeing the most success there? Is that market share gains? Is that pricing getting into some new markets? If you could provide any color there that would be helpful? Then when is your expectation for the next update on OEM?\nAmy Hood: Great. Let me take the second one first because it's the easiest. We still do expect transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2014, and post closing if there are any EPS impact changes to what we said before we will give them post-closing, so now back to your original question on SQL. That's a terrific one to get to talk about. Our growth there is as you said both, share growth and revenue growth. It happens, I think, generally both, in BI which we have seen a lot of traction with. I don't know if you have had a chance to see some of our Power View announcements recently. Our ability to sort of span from the end user to the hardest Big Data problems really has resonated both, in the market and with industry analysts who has taken a strong position that we are the real market leader there. The other thing I would say is, a very healthy performance of our premium SKUs. Our premium SKUs have continued to provide market growth and I think are competing quite well with the competition.\nBrendan Barnicle: Great. Thanks, guys.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Brendon. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nGregg Moskowitz: Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. Just two questions. First, Amy, if I recall correctly, I believe last quarter you had mentioned an expectation for double-digit annuity growth in fiscal '14. Is that still how you are thinking about the annuity part of the business? Secondly, the year-over-year cloud revenue growth you reported was certainly impressive, but I was wondering if you could shed some light perhaps on how much of Azure billings or revenue are incremental versus [ballistic]?\nAmy Hood: Too good question, I do expect our annuity growth and the guidance we gave it still does assume double-digit annuity growth going forward, and I think our performance this quarter gives me confidence that the guidance in Q2 is the right one given our strengths and our competitive position. Secondly, on cloud revenue, your question gives me an opportunity to talk about the importance of our hybrid cloud. Within especially our server business, our ability to power the cloud whether you want to run it, you want a service provider to run it or you want to use ours, is really an incredibly powerful story and I think in some ways whether or not cannibalizing becomes somewhat difficult. What we generally found right now is that it has been often additive, if you look at our server growth all up which we try to provide to help give some parameters around that, to give us some confidence that we are both, growing the base and providing additive opportunity. I think that's the number I would probably look to, to see the impact there.\nGregg Moskowitz: Great. Thanks very much.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Operator, I think, we are down to our last question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, two quick ones for you, Amy, on the commercial cloud offerings. I guess, first, around Office 365, you mentioned you have seen pretty good uptake even outside the U.S. I was interested in just your ability to monetize Office 365 in some of the emerging markets that have been challenging over time for Office. Then secondly, as a follow-up to Gregg's question on server, within Azure, how much of the uptick in Azure is coming from sort of existing Microsoft logos versus bringing on net new logos onto the platform? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Great. Thanks, Kirk. Two things, I do think it's interesting. Maybe the best example of how to think about us moving beyond our traditional markets is the fact that we were the first to commence a data center in China, a market that we have historically had challenges monetizing at a high level. We went there, we are going there with Office 365 and Azure, we look forward to being able to make progress, we are investing both, headcount and capital dollars, because we do believe this provides interesting opportunity for us to begin monetizing end markets that have been harder for us to grow, maybe with our more traditional business model. Secondly with Azure, I think we have seen both, but the thing I would say is what has been really helpful is that as we make it easier to attach Azure services to our normal rhythm in the field for enterprise agreements and through licensing. It provides a really helpful way and a really easy selling motion to provide customers flexibility. We added in the normal rhythm of the sales motion. We allow people to try, use and buy. And that has served us well in terms of being able to expose Azure to more and more customers in a normal selling cycle. So I think that's probably one of the better ways. It's the same actual selling rhythm we have used with Office 365 so successfully. And with that, I wanted to say thank you. I know that this quarter, we changed reporting segments and that requires a lot of work. So thank you for all the work put in to understand our transition that we are trying to make as a company. So I am going to turn it back to Chris to say his final words.\nChris Suh: So that wraps up today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those of you unable to attend in person, these events will generally be webcast and you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we will share the results of the final quarter of the year and our optimism for the year ahead. We delivered $22.2 billion in revenue this quarter and $93.6 billion total revenue for the fiscal year 2015, an increase of 8% year over year. We pushed forward in our transformation by focusing our investment in areas where we have differentiation and significant opportunity for future growth in large addressable markets. We galvanized around our mission and ambitions. We aligned our structure to deliver better products at a more rapid pace. We focused our advertising business on search. We focused our mapping efforts on higher-level experiences and development services. We restructured our phone portfolio so that we can operate more efficiently near term while driving reinvention long term. We invested more in new mobile applications like Wunderlist, Acompli, and Sunrise. We also strengthened our enterprise cloud platform by acquiring Revolution Analytics, Datazen, and BlueStripe in this quarter alone. And we are at the threshold of the Windows 10 launch. I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem. In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year. We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018. With that as the backdrop, I want to walk you through the progress we are making in each one of our three ambitions. Let me start with reinventing productivity in business processes, including our efforts across Office 365 and Dynamics. We continue to see strong demand for Office 365 and Dynamics products. We now have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, and customers are signing up at a pace of nearly 1 million per month. In addition, we surpassed 150 million downloads of Office Mobile on iOS and Android and have introduced a new version of Office for the Mac. In the commercial space, the number of Office 365 users continues to climb, with seats growing 74% year over year. Office 365 now is in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, and more than 55% of the installed base is on premium workloads. It is clear that we have success moving customers to the cloud, given half of all the enterprise agreement renewals were for Office 365 this quarter. Small and medium businesses offer one of our best opportunities for new growth in the cloud. In fact, for more than a year now, we have seen 50,000 new SMB customers adopt Office 365 every month. Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced our new Office 365 Premium SKU for business, E5. Now our customers will get rich new voice functionality in Skype for Business with Cloud PBX and PSTN Conferencing, deep analytics with Delve analytics and Power BI Pro, and advanced security features such as lockbox and advanced threat protection. With E5, we have expanded our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion. This new E5 SKU and the launch of Office 2016 will drive one of the biggest new businesses for us. Let's now turn to CRM. This market alone is $20 billion-plus and has massive opportunity for reinvention. Mainstreaming Dynamics into our engineering sales and marketing efforts gives us the ability to participate in this large and growing market in a more meaningful way. Last week we announced the acquisition of FieldOne, which helps strengthen our Dynamics CRM customer service offering. This quarter, total paid seats for Dynamics CRM online increased 140% year over year, and we have more than 8 million paid Dynamics seats across CRM and ERP in total, up 25% year over year. This creates a great foundation for future growth in our Dynamics business. Next, I want to share our progress in building the intelligent cloud platform with Azure. Again this quarter, we have seen proof that preference for our cloud staff services creates a flywheel of growth for our cloud platform services. In Azure, both revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits year over year. We tripled our revenue from Azure premium services this quarter. In the enterprise mobility services, we now have 17,000 customers. Appeal for Visual Studio Tools has grown to include developers beyond our traditional base with some of the decisions we made to embrace open source with .Net and support across platform development. Since November, we have seen more than 5 million downloads of Visual Studio Community, the fastest ever adoption of a Visual Studio product. Visual Studio Online continues to gain momentum, with over 3.1 million registered users. Business intelligence and analytics is another large, rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are focused on strengthening our offers in this space. Just last week we announced the availability of Cortana Analytics Suite, our fully-managed big data and advanced analytics solution. We're not only building the tools but are also delivering the insights customers need to transform their businesses. Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and another $30 billion market opportunity for us, and we are building capability to meet customers' need. For example, we've made significant investments in security with Azure Key Vault, enabling customers to protect data in the cloud with secure key management and encryption customers can control. We have four new certifications for Azure, bringing our certification and at the station total to 22 globally, more than any other cloud platform today. Our third bold ambition is to create more personal computing experiences with Windows and our devices. I am thrilled we are just days away from the start of Windows 10. It's the first step towards our goal of 1 billion Windows 10 active devices in the fiscal year 2018. Our aspiration with Windows 10 is to move people from meeting to choosing to loving Windows. Based on feedback from more than 5 million people who have been using Windows 10, we believe people will love the familiarity of Windows 10 and the innovation. It's safe, secure, and always up to date. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office, universal apps, and Continuum. And Windows 10 will deliver innovative new experiences like Inking on Microsoft Edge and gaming across Xbox and PCs, and also opens up entirely new device categories such as Hololens. Windows 10 will deliver significant value to enterprise customers as well. Windows 10 provides advanced security capabilities with additional features for hardware-based security, mobile work and data protection. It also provides a single device management platform across all devices, from phones to laptops to Internet of Things devices. And Windows 10 helps enterprises stay up to date with Windows Update for Business and Windows Store for Business. While the PC ecosystem has been under pressure recently, I do believe that Windows 10 will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. First, we have an OEM ecosystem that is creating exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10. In fact, our OEM partners have over 2,000 distinct devices or configurations already in testing for Windows 10 upgrades as well as hundreds of new hardware designs. We are delighted that the first of these exciting new devices will start to be available on Windows 10 launch day, and by this holiday we will be selling the widest range of Windows hardware ever available. Second, we will generate new growth through gross margin on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio. We will also significantly reduce our losses on the phone by operating more effectively and efficiently with a more focused portfolio. Third, we will grow monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer space. In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management security, app dev, and servicing capability. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with store, search, and gaming. We are confident that these are the right levers to revitalize Windows and restore growth. The progress we made this quarter and the forward-looking guidance that Amy will share shows the opportunity for renewed growth is real. In hardware, both Surface and Xbox had an incredible Q4. We more than doubled Surface revenue to nearly $900 million this quarter, capping off a year in which it delivered more than $3.6 billion in revenue. Both consumers and enterprise customers love this device. Surface is clearly a product where we have gotten the formula right, earned fans, and can apply this formula to other parts of the hardware portfolio. Gaming is an important scenario for Windows 10, and our success with Xbox this quarter gives us a strong starting position heading into launch. Xbox Live users grew 22% this quarter and logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of gameplay. Our growing fan base is excited for the best games lineup in our history. All of this comes together with Windows 10, when fans can connect with each other, stream all of their Xbox One games to Windows 10, and experience the best virtual reality platform given our partnership with Oculus Rift and Valve. In search, Bing will now power both differentiated experiences on Windows 10 such as Cortana as well as search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio sites in addition to the partnership we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon, and Apple. With advertising revenue growth of 21% year over year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year. It's been a strong year of progress. Above all else, I'm optimistic about our future. Our cloud services are accelerating fast, and Windows is positioned for renewed growth. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in more detail. I look forward to rejoining you after that for questions. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the strong progress that we've made as a company over the past year. Key strategic initiatives such as cloud, first-party hardware, and consumer services delivered significant growth as well as improved profitability. Commercial customer renewals remained healthy with strong adoption of cloud services and a higher mix of annuity than we expected. And our disciplined approach to resource allocation has allowed us to increase investment in the growth initiatives Satya mentioned while reducing the company's operating expenses. This allows us to better compete in markets with structural growth where we feel we have unique competitive advantages. With that said, I will start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the results. This quarter we recorded an impairment charge related to our phone hardware business and incurred integration and restructuring expenses. Additionally, like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I'll give results and growth rates adjusting for the impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, but also in constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business fundamentals. Revenue was $22.2 billion, down 5% and down 2% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year included $382 million of revenue that we recognized at the conclusion of our commercial agreement with Nokia. Significant gross margin improvement across commercial cloud, Surface, and our consumer services helped to mitigate the impact on gross margin from the decline in D&C licensing. Total gross margin declined 7% and 3% in constant currency. Operating income declined 3% and 1% in constant currency. Earnings per share were $0.62, growth of 11% and growth of 8% in constant currency. Unearned revenue grew 1% to $25.3 billion and 7% in constant currency. Commercial unearned was better than expected, as we saw a higher mix of annuity in the quarter. From a geographic perspective, the majority of markets performed in line with our expectations. The notable exception was Brazil, where inflation and macroeconomic volatility weighed on our performance. Overall, macro conditions remain a challenge in some large opportunity markets like China, Russia, Japan, and Brazil. There was slightly less impact from currency than our expectation. With that backdrop, I'll move to a detailed discussion of our results. Q4 last year effectively marked the end of the XP refresh cycle. It impacted our Windows OEM and non-annuity volume licensing as well as our Office non-annuity volume licensing results. During that time, OEM revenue exceeded that of the underlying PC market, driven by a higher attach of Pro, particularly within the developed markets. This quarter Pro declined by roughly 21%. And similar to last quarter, we saw Pro attach remain at pre-XP levels, even with the underlying softness in the business PC market. The annuity portion of Windows licensing grew again on a constant currency basis, with non- annuity revenue declining due to XP. Windows non-Pro revenue declined 27%, as OEMs tightly managed PC inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch, particularly in developed markets. In our view, this is a healthy state for the channel as we head into a transformational launch that starts next week. Consumer Office 365 had another strong quarter of net subscriber growth. Overall, consumer Office revenue results reflected the decline in the underlying driver of that business, developed market consumer PC sales. Within D&C licensing, the transition to Office 365 accounted for 13 points, and the impact of Japan's PC market accounted for another 19 points. We had another impressive quarter in search, with revenue growth of 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per search. As Satya said, revenue from Surface more than doubled this quarter, with continued strength of Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3. Enterprise sales accelerated this quarter, and sales of Surface 3 were particularly strong to educational customers. Our differentiated products as well as improved discipline and execution helped to improve gross margins by $450 million this quarter and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015. Within Xbox, strong growth in consoles, online transactions, and first-party games helped to drive revenue growth of 27%. This progress as well as the excitement we generated at E3 with Xbox exclusive gaming content and backwards compatibility demonstrates the building momentum that exists within the Xbox ecosystem. In phones, we sold 8.4 million Lumias, which is an increase over last year's full-quarter sales. ASPs, however, have continued to decline. Gross margin declined this quarter, driven by lower per unit margins on Lumia devices as well as reduced volumes in non-Lumia phones. As announced on July 8, we are changing our approach in this business and are focused on delivering differentiated experiences for our targeted customer segments while improving our operating results. Moving to our commercial results, total revenue across our two segments grew slightly in USD and 4% in constant currency. Our contracted-not-billed balance, which is a key indicator of customer commitment, reached an all-time high of over $24.5 billion, and it reached this level even with the significant appreciation in the U.S. dollar. Constant currency bookings were flat to the prior year, though as a reminder, last year commercial bookings grew 23% on the strength of a large renewal base as well as the end of XP, discussed earlier. Our Office commercial business continues to transition to Office 365. We again grew the installed seat base for Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business. Office 365 allows us to have a deeper ongoing relationship with all of our customers, which in turn provides us with the opportunity to expand and grow our business over time. Because of this transition as well as weakness in Japan and the impact of XP, Office commercial products and services grew 1% in constant currency, quite similar to Q3. Dynamics revenue grew 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the strong CRM results Satya talked about and our ERP business, which saw 35% growth in customers this quarter. Server products and services grew 4% and 9% in constant currency, continuing to outperform our peers in the enterprise software sector. SQL Server share growth continued, as customers value its high performance and lower cost of ownership. Revenue and licenses of Windows Server grew against the backdrop of a declining server hardware market; and in the public cloud space, yet another quarter of significant Azure usage growth. Additionally, we significantly grew the gross margin percentage in our commercial other segment, increasing 13 points to over 43%. Moving to operating expenses, which declined 9% or 4% in constant currency, our continued disciplined approach has allowed us to incrementally fund strategic initiatives without having to increase our expense base. Other income was favorable to our expectations, driven by gains on foreign currency and sales of investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% and was at the high end of our guided range, due in part to strong performance in our computing and gaming hardware segment in the U.S. We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders this quarter, nearly double the amount from last year. With that overview of the current quarter, let me turn to our outlook, starting with a few overall comments. As has been communicated over the past couple of months, the accounting for Windows 10 will change. We will be deferring a portion of Windows 10 revenue, primarily OEM, and recognizing it over time, generally two to four years. As shared previously, the initial deferral and the subsequent recognition of those deferrals will be netted in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting. Most importantly, underlying billings and cash flow won't change. Therefore, our commentary in this and subsequent earnings calls, including our guidance, will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact, which we believe is the best reflection of business health. With that background, let me share some thoughts on fiscal 2016. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a significant impact on results over the course of FY 2016, assuming rates across our largest currencies, the euro, Japanese yen, and the British pound, stay in line with current rates, and that the geographic mix of revenue stays as forecasted. In our non-annuity businesses, the impact is immediate as the revenue is recognized in quarter. In our annuity business, revenue is deferred and the impact is delayed as we earn the revenue off the balance sheet. In total, we expect FX will negatively impact total revenue growth by five points in each quarter of H1, with seven points of negative impact in our commercial segments. H1 would be the peak of the FX headwinds. And in H2, we expect FX to have three points of negative impact in total and roughly four points of negative impact on our commercial revenue. With Windows 10, we expect momentum to build throughout the year, as we and our partners bring new devices, applications, and services to market. We expect this to benefit our business results in the second half of the fiscal year. With the strength in Xbox and Xbox Live along with the launch of Halo 5 in October, Xbox will continue to grow both fans and profitability. With the recently announced changes in phone, there will be significant revenue declines year over year in the phone segment each quarter. With the proactive measures we've taken to reduce our cost structure, overall losses will also decline for the fiscal year. We would expect the majority of that improvement in the second half of the year once the restructuring efforts are materially complete. Bing will be profitable in FY 2016. And assuming the macro environment is stable, we expect that our commercial momentum will continue, highlighted by growth in our commercial cloud. We remain on track to achieve our $20 billion commercial cloud ambition in fiscal 2018. We now expect operating expenses to be $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion, which is lower than the guidance we provided in April. The lower guidance reflects the savings from our restructuring of the phone business as well as important investments to drive top line growth as we support Windows 10, our first-party hardware efforts, as well as sales head count to accelerate our leadership position in the commercial cloud. We expect our full-year tax rate to be 24% plus or minus one point, excluding the net impact from the Windows 10 deferral. Now to Q1, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range reflects Windows revenue roughly in line with the PC market. Within Consumer Office, we expect to transition to Office 365 subscriptions to continue. In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenues to be $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As a reminder, we launched Surface Pro 3 in late June last year, with launch benefits extending into Q1. As far as hardware, we expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, reflecting our change in approach. We expect gross margin in phone to improve sequentially in Q1. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with continued growth in Bing, Consumer Office 365, and Xbox Live transactions. And in commercial, as I discussed previously, we expect a significant FX headwind this quarter. Our constant currency growth is expected to be about 7% in Q1, which assumes we continue to take share in key markets and build momentum in the new areas we have entered. With the negative impact of FX, we expect revenue to be roughly flat. On commercial licensing, we expect revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with a continued shift to annuity; and in commercial other, with the significant growth in our cloud revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We expect COGS to be $7.0 billion $7.2 billion, with the variability being driven by the hardware segment. We expect operating expenses to be $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million. Excluding the Windows 10 deferral and the impact of foreign currency, we expect the sequential decline in unearned to be slightly better than historic seasonality, driven by the growing mix of annuity revenue. In closing, I'm proud of the tremendous amount of progress that our company has made over the past year. We've improved how we operate in virtually every sense. These changes have allowed us to aggressively invest in areas that will drive future growth for the company. I'm looking forward for a better position to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead of us. With that, let me turn it back over to Chris for the Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, please repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to double-click on Office 365. You guys showed another huge quarter of growth in terms of your consumer seat count, and I think it was 86% growth on the commercial other side for Office 365. I'm wondering if you could just drill into both the consumer and then enterprise side, just the trends you're seeing there. And obviously the guidance you all just provided, it looks like you expect those trends to continue in Q1, so any color there would be great.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I'll take that. Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. On the consumer side, as you noted, we are growing 1 million subs a month, and that's fantastic growth for us. The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have a subscription relationship with us. On the enterprise side, the growth remains very exciting for us, and the growth comes in multiple forms. It comes in the form of just the EAs renewing more to Office 365. It also comes in the form of some of the more comprehensive suites, the E3 and the new E5. That's the commitment we are seeing. And we also see small businesses. I talked about the 50,000 businesses, small and medium-sized businesses each month signing up for Office 365. That's pretty unprecedented. Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. And that cloud revenue number that is the 88% is all up cloud revenues inclusive of Office 365, EMS, and Azure. And it's good to see that kind of growth at that kind of scale now with $8 billion.\nAmy Hood: One thing I would add, Phil, to that is an important dynamic that we're seeing in Office 365. As we are having this momentum build, in fact we talked about some of the new customers we're adding, and the way we see that is the install base growing. And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. And when you think about why that's so critical long term, it's our ability to sell some of the workloads Satya actually referenced that will be in E5 when it launches. They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services. So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats again.\nChris Suh: Okay, thank you, Phil. We'll take the next question now, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.\nBrent J. Thill: Good afternoon. Satya, the server business continues a steady outperformance and, as Amy pointed out, better growth than your peers. I guess a couple questions as it relates to the Windows 2003 retirement and any impact you're seeing there. And then secondarily, if you could, just comment on some of the new product launches. It seems like there's a stack of new solutions that are coming on the server side that look pretty exciting. Your partners are excited about it. If you could highlight what you see as the most interesting from your perspective over the next several quarters. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Overall, I'd start even with the bold view that my server business is not a legacy business. We fundamentally think about servers as the extension of the cloud. I even describe it architecturally as the edge of our cloud. Every server, for example, has things like disaster recovery, backup, and tier-ing with the cloud. And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. And you see it in the numbers. Our servers even this quarter grew 9%. And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well. And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment. So as our cloud continues to grow, obviously, we are getting where there is more capability in the cloud. We're incenting customers and our partners to move to the cloud. But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave. I'm excited about our SQL product. I think it goes into the first preview next \u2013 in fact, tomorrow. And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product because for the first time you can take a single table in a database and you would tier it with the cloud, and that kind of capability only we can provide, and that's something that I'm looking forward to.\nAmy Hood: And, Brent, to your specific question on Windows Server 2003, we did have a good quarter, as we talked about, in Windows Server. But in general, that business, unlike the quiet upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. That isn't to say there isn't ample opportunity for us to make sure we upgrade customers to the higher-value product and more secure and more manageable offerings we have in the server business.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research.\nMark L. Moerdler: Thank you, nice quarter. I want to drill in, in terms of the move to the cloud. This quarter the year-over-year server product and services revenue growth was slower than it was in the past quarters. How much of that is because you're seeing now some revenue shift to Azure, or is it not yet seeing any revenue shift going? And then I have a follow-up question.\nAmy Hood: Why don't I take that one, and we'll see what Mark's follow-up is? At 9% growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be a positive outlier to the peer group. And for me, that type of performance in double digits for the year, I still feel quite good about. In general, what's interesting I think is you're getting to the crux of it is do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud. We continue to see that. The very best example, frankly, as Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings. It's taking something that's very unique, builds off of our core in the server business, and allows us to both grow and add new perspective there. So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen in particular this quarter. Also, if you'll remember, a year ago we had a very big base of expirations in Q4 and had very strong performance a year ago. So I don't look at it as a direct trend line.\nSatya Nadella: The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all. Even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management. But we now have management data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including the Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting. And that growth is great to see. Same thing on server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units. Cortana Analytics, we never participated in any of the advanced analytics workloads at all in spite of all the success we had in the database business. So I'm excited about built new workloads that in many cases are born in the cloud workloads where we are expanding our market opportunity and continuing to outperform our peers and grab share when it comes to on-premise.\nMark L. Moerdler: That's very helpful. Switching gears a bit, on Windows, obviously you're seeing some amount of delay due to Windows 10 on the OEM side. Can you give maybe a little more higher color in terms of how you're thinking about that, how big a delay is it, how much we could see that starting to be replaced next quarter and beyond?\nSatya Nadella: I'll take that and, Amy, you can add to it. The way the Windows ecosystem works is there are phases to it. And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows-as-a-service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us. But that said, there are three distinct phases. The first phase is what I will describe as the upgrade phase. That's what starts in a week's time, and that is a more retail execution and upgrade. Then come the fall, you will see the devices from all the OEMs going into the holiday quarter. And then the enterprise upgrades; in fact, we have a release of enterprise features, which I mentioned in my script, which will ship in that timeframe. And I expect piloting to start and deployments to start in the second half of the fiscal year. So that's how I would think about the OEM as well as enterprise adoption. So my bullishness for Windows 10 is more in the second half of the fiscal year, and of course it will build. It will build starting in a week's time in retail and in the upgrades, but I see this in three phases.\nAmy Hood: And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean. This is a healthy state. It's within the range of normal. So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it. It is pretty standard in fact, as Satya talked about, in terms of the dynamic. And he mentioned we are feeling I think a lot of excitement from the ecosystem about what's possible with some of the new devices that will come. And so I don't really think of it in that way. I think about it as an encouragement that they want to fill the channel as quickly as they can over the coming quarters with new machines.\nMark L. Moerdler: Thank you, I appreciate it.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.\nKeith E. Weiss: Excellent, nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill into the new strategy around the phone business a little bit. The revenue expectation for Q1 I think was below our expectations and I think a point below what the Street was looking for. Can you give us a sense of how you see that business trending over a longer period of time? Because there is a significant restructuring going on and I think \u2013 I would think a lot of guys have a good view in their head of what your expectation is for this business on a revenue run rate basis? Or what do you expect to be selling this year on a going forward basis is right now?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. That's perhaps the biggest shift because I think about Windows 10 in its entirety, the Windows ecosystem in its entirety. We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio, and you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing, just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories. All of that is what I want to do broadly. And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hardware, it applies to Hololens, and that's how I view it. I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself with Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important, and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows 10. That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices, and we hope to change that with Windows 10. We have in fact good traction in the business segment. This is business customers who are actually buying phone devices, which is basically a radio with essentially a smartphone to be able to deploy their line-of-business applications. That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about, so you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course, management and security. So that's a place where we want to continue to focus. And in the value smartphones, that's the place where I want us to be much more efficient. We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many, which price points we want to participate. That's where you will see the most significant operational changes from how we operated last year to the coming year.\nAmy Hood: And so, Keith, the way that I think about it and I tried to outline it in my comments is that the significant revenue declines quarter over quarter through the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone. It's an approach that we've executed in other hardware segments that I feel is a proven model for us. Our profitability will also improve. More of that comes in the second half of the year structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rate. But I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about over time you expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line.\nKeith E. Weiss: Got it. And if I could sneak one more in just on the security side of the business, I think a lot of guys have thought traditionally about security as something that Microsoft does to make their platform more secure, and it does provide more confidence in users using your platforms and your tools. On a going-forward basis, is there more of an opportunity for you guys to sell security as more of a standalone opportunity? It's something that's in very high demand today with those looking for more secure solutions. Is that something that could potentially be more of a standalone opportunity for Microsoft on a go-forward basis?\nSatya Nadella: In fact, we are adding significant value in security. It's much better for us, for example, to add capabilities. There are no (46:55) 365 in security, and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lock box. That's actually a pretty \u2013 a very cool set of features that allow both regulators and businesses to have, for example, audit ability and control over their movement in the cloud. Similarly Azure, where we launched a whole set of security offers around how people can encrypt and manage keys. So those are all security features. We bought a company in Colorado that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management. So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth. So the approach we're taking is we are essentially creating, to your point, security value around our products, which allows us to participate in essentially a security market that we never did in the ways that we are. So it's more than just launching one point security product. It's much more broadly participating in the security market, and you have seen some of that in the inorganic moves and the suites we have created.\nKeith E. Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Hi. Amy, just for you on the annuity, it looks like annuity was about 82% of the commercial revenue for the last two quarters. How high do you think that goes? It sounds like you do expect that to continue to go up, although it probably never gets to 100%.\nAmy Hood: I do think over the long term you're right. That is how I think about it. And frankly, inherent in the conversation around moving to the cloud with the aggressive targets we've given, that is implied, to your point. And so I think 100% is not the logical answer. There will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it. But I do think over time, we do expect that to trend in that general direction.\nWalter H. Pritchard: And then, Satya, you mentioned CRM in your comments, your prepared comments, which we haven't really heard you talk that much about as an area of interest in the past. I'm wondering. What changed in your view, or how do you look to bring that into it sounds like more the core productivity scenario that you deliver?\nSatya Nadella: Overall, business process collaborations, communications, these category boundaries are things that I believe are going to change. I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools. And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of how do we go forward. And CRM has taken our own Dynamics product, has taken some pretty unique approaches. And quite frankly, I was the one who opened up our communications and collaborations for other CRM vendors. One of the things that I'm very explicit about is we will have an open platform for other business process applications because it's a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB. And so we want to be having a platform play as well as our own business applications play, and both of them should be high-growth for us. And in the last year, we just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now for the mainstream that's across Microsoft because I'm a big believer in this because I think we have something unique to add. As opposed to driving our own top line/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation, and that's what is exciting to see. And it's not just CRM. I'm actually excited about our ERP business. Some of the numbers that Amy talked about is growth in the seats. And when I think about data as the new currency, we have lots of managed seats and a lot of data which all will move to the cloud. And so things like Power BI and Cortana Analytics can help customers transform. So in fact, that's one of the reasons why we have been very optimistic about some of our new data capabilities because we have the attach capability go out even in the install base of Dynamics.\nAmy Hood: And, Walter, just quickly, this is one of the areas that we have invested in actually leading into this past fiscal year, FY 2015. And the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment. So I think we both feel very good about the momentum that's built through the year.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Great, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Walter. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.\nKarl E. Keirstead: Hi, thanks, a question for Amy on the cost control front. It looks like you once again came in below your OpEx guide, but I think the COGS number came a little bit above what you had guided to three months ago, and I'm just wondering if you could talk through that. Obviously, it affects everybody's gross margin calculations. Was it the hardware mix shift? Was it the challenges with the phone business? Perhaps a little color there might help us. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Sure, Karl. Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit. We outperformed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that took us a little bit outside the COGS range but not as much as our revenue outperformed. So actually, margins structurally were better than I thought they would be. And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment.\nKarl E. Keirstead: Okay, good. That's helpful, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Karl, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Azure. You obviously have strong momentum there. Can you talk a little bit about the use cases you see from the enterprise and SMB customers? Is this very much a test and development situation, or are you thinking of broader adoption there as defined by obviously Office 365, et cetera? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: At this point, I would say it's pretty broad even use cases for even enterprise customers. There's definitely dev/test happening. There is production IaaS infrastructure-as-a-service deployment given some of the new high-performance SKUs and storage options that we have. And we've seen significant adoption of SQL, so this is Azure DB, machine learning-as-a-service. One of the things that we realize is as every company out there becomes a software company, beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company. They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities. So that's another place where we're seeing wide adoption. We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends, back ends for new front ends, so essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their web. That's another use case that's high growth for us. And of course, Cortana Analytics; this is the big data side of it. This is happening in IT. It's happening, as I said, in digital offices within each one of the customers. So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases. And some of the customers have talked about it in their recent set of conferences, from our Partner Conference to our Ignite Conference. We have been in fact showcasing; even our ad campaign showcases some of these use cases.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Raimo, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.\nHeather A. Bellini: Great, thank you. I just had two questions, pretty quick ones. Just to follow up on Azure, I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the mix between IaaS and PaaS and how you've seen that shift evolve over the last few quarters. And then secondly, just to follow up I think on Walter's question, yes, you've definitely been focusing on the customer relationship management opportunity and the financials market more. But given the big SaaS incumbent already competing in that area, can you share with us? Do you think you have the assets you need internally to execute against your long-term goals?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. On the IaaS with the SaaS, it's an interesting question. I've not looked at it in isolation, because what happens is at least the use cases, what starts off as IaaS suddenly will start using Azure AD for identity management, will use a little bit of our media services, for example, just doing content and encoding. So there's a mix always. So there's nothing pure PaaS, nothing pure IaaS. That's the trend I see, but it's a split that we should go take a look at and then offline maybe even talk about it. But overall, we see significant amount of IaaS in the last year, because that's probably the place where we had more of a weakness which we have now overcome. And so we're seeing significant growth of IaaS in the enterprise. But the place where we continue to have significant differentiation is in some of these managed services and PaaS. And that I think is the mix on it. And then on the Dynamics side, I absolutely believe we have a huge opportunity. Having worked in business applications for a long time, first of all, the market is very fragmented. I think people like to talk about leaders, and there are clearly leaders when you go to the very top of the enterprise customers and segments. But the way the market splits into verticals and into horizontals and then the platform affects it, there's plenty of opportunity. For sure, you've got to be one of the players. It will be three players, four players, whatever, but in every technology paradigm, you want to be one of them. We already have a $2 billion-plus Dynamics business. I talked about the total number of seats. And now we have this triple-digit CRM online growth. So I feel that we are in a good position. And I feel that things \u2013 we'll look at and even some of the inorganic means to keep growing it. In fact, the field service acquisition I talked about in my script is an example of that. So that's my bullishness on our business process prospects.\nHeather A. Bellini: Thank you very much.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets.\nRoss MacMillan: Thanks for taking my question. First on OpEx, the guidance, Amy, is impressive. I presume that fully accommodates the restructuring announced two weeks ago. And then last year, you said core Microsoft ex-NBS would be down slightly in OpEx. I wondered if you could provide a similar comment for fiscal 2016 for core Microsoft ex-phone.\nAmy Hood: Sure. Look, I talked a little bit about it, but let me go into a bit of detail on that. I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion full-year OpEx guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring, and it certainly does. And so what you can then see, relating to the second half your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen. I outlined three on the call. The third one I probably could have expanded more on. The first one is Windows 10. The second is the first-party hardware, where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4. And then finally, the third bucket was about accelerating our commercial cloud lead. And I do feel like in that area, we could invest in Office 365 some of the new E5 capabilities and look forward to adding sales capacity to take advantage of that. We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly. And so I look and see that as an opportunity to accelerate top line growth.\nSatya Nadella: And one thing I would just add because a lot of folks even ask about our business process and business applications, I want to build a long-term profitable business. In other words, one of the keys in business apps is you can always get into the trap of overspending in sales and marketing and not having long-term leverage at all. One of the things I feel very good about our position is how do you really build a long-term profitable business; that's front and center to me. So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing because we do believe the products \u2013 in fact, there is a different way to sell even business process applications because of the cloud, and that's something that we want to take advantage of.\nRoss MacMillan: And I had have one quick follow-up, if I could. That's helpful. At Analyst Day you did talk about \u2013 I think it was 8% unit growth in the Office ecosystem over the last three years. And it sounds like you continued to see nice unit growth in Office. How should we think about that going forward? Are you fully expecting to continue to see unit growth? And then also just a clarification, I think your customer lifetime value was based on existing SKUs. So as you introduce E5 and others, does that open up the potential for even higher customer lifetime value? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Great. I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, that it did occur again this quarter. So I feel good that we're staying on the trajectory that we showed in the projections. I do continue to expect that to happen, as we shared back that last week in April. On the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right. Generically, each of the examples was quite different. There were people that were upgrading from X to Y. There were people that were just simply moving to the cloud. But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunity's billed value and deploy it more quickly to customers. Generally, I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question. I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margin. So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. So I associate it, yes, with lifetime value, and I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up.\nRoss MacMillan: That's great, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Ross. We have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital.\nDaniel H. Ives: Thanks, just one last one just on M&A. Maybe you could just talk through the change in the strategy. Obviously, given what's happened with the Nokia write-down, the security acquisition going to Pivotal-Cisco year, how you're thinking about M&A in the scheme of everything, especially as you guys have been pretty tight on cost controls and everything else. Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Overall, again, the way I look at it is, first of all I'm most focused on obviously our organic growth. And in there, Amy alluded to this. We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing. And we'll continue to do that because I think there are significant new opportunities for us to go after, and that will require us to reallocate aggressively, and that to me is core. But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means. When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of last year and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing. So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have. Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up. They're pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all of the things that we have done in the Azure space. So we'll continue to do that. And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that. So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.\nDaniel H.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll focus my remarks on our three business areas: Cloud, Windows and Devices. Next week at Build, our developer conference, I\u2019ll share more about our ambitions and how our next-generation platforms will empower every person and organization. This quarter, we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. We are seeing the impact of foreign exchange, geopolitical trends in certain geographies and product transitions. We\u2019re taking steps to respond quickly and adjust our plans as needed while we continue to move forward in our transformation. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our business performance. More importantly though, it\u2019s clear that we are well on our way to transforming our products and businesses across all of Microsoft. The early signs are evident in how our customers are using our products, which I\u2019ll share throughout my remarks today. Our momentum in the cloud is a highlight. Increasingly, customers are choosing Microsoft cloud services to transform their own businesses, going beyond just moving existing workloads to the cloud. These results showcase our ability to transform and perform simultaneously. With that in mind, I\u2019ll walk you through the quarter, starting with our Cloud business. At the core of our results this quarter is incredible growth across a growing portfolio of cloud services. Our commercial Cloud business is a source of strength driven by Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM. Our commercial cloud annualized run rate now stands at $6.3 billion, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth. Office 365 is clearly a key growth driver. Like any cloud service, we track how people are actually using it and we are proud that Office 365 is a vibrant, active service. Right now, there are nearly 50 million Office 365 monthly active users inside businesses. Exchange Online alone sees about 60 billion requests per day from all connected clients, about 70 billion transactions or user actions and there are 830 million meetings a month created in Office. And we\u2019re increasing our Office value proposition for businesses with new mobile device management capabilities built into Office 365 and through our continued commitment to customer data compliance and security. We released new versions of Office Dells for mobile devices, and earlier this month, we rolled out Skype for Business to the Office 365 customers worldwide. Finally, in anticipation of the release of Windows 10, we have announced a preview of new touch-first Office universal app. Small and medium-sized customers are adopting Office 365 at a continued rapid pace, led by our more than 65,000 Office 365 partners. Thirty telecommunications companies are already offering 365 to small and medium-sized customers, including some of the largest in the world. In Q3, we announced a new partnership with T-Mobile to bring Office 365 to more customers and enhance the partnership with GoDaddy. At Build next week, I\u2019ll talk to you even more about Office as a platform and how developers can connect into the Office framework to both harness the rich data and have their own application extensions available to ultimately a billion plus Office users. Azure is also seeing impressive usage momentum. Right now, more than five million organizations are represented in Azure Active Directory with more than 425 million identities. Storage is also a strong indicator of consumption, and now, we have 50 trillion objects stored in Azure, a 3x growth year-over-year in storage transactions, more than five trillion in March alone. And Azure websites are growing with nearly half a million sites hosted. Beyond strong usage of our existing services, we are excited by the customer response to our expanding portfolio of new cloud offerings. In particular, Enterprise Mobility Suite is growing and we now have more than 13,000 enterprise customers using EMS. And as customer adoption and usage in the cloud increases, more developers are choosing Azure for the applications. Nearly three million developers are signed up for Visual Studio online, up 2x year-over-year. To foster developer innovation, we launched Azure App Service this quarter. It offers a powerful set of development tools for creating web and mobile app backends for any platform or device while enabling integration with other applications, including Office 365, Dynamics, Salesforce, Facebook, Twitter, SAP , Oracle, Siebel and many more. We also delivered new Azure compute instances this quarter with more memory and storage than any other public cloud provider, attracting more mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And we improved our Big Data capabilities with support for the latest version of Hadoop and LINUX in HDInsight and improved disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery and Backup . We\u2019re seeing significant customer interest and adoption in Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics , in particular, for IOT scenarios. In a world where every company has the opportunity to become a software company, a diverse set of companies like ThyssenKrupp , Toyota, Rockwell , Ford, Fujitsu and Millay are engaging with us in their transformation. Further, our Dynamics business also has traction in the enterprise. It is now nearly a $2 billion business. Dynamics CRM online enterprise paid seats more than doubled year-over-year, and we more than doubled enterprise seats sold this quarter for ERP. We also announced a wave of innovation in Microsoft Dynamics CRM this quarter with new social, mobile and analytics capabilities for business process transformation, including seamless integration of Dynamics CRM with Office 365. While our commercial Cloud business is expanding dramatically, we\u2019re also seeing strong growth in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 consumer added an average of one million new customers per month and we now have more than 12 million subscribers, an increase of 35% over the prior quarter. We\u2019re clearly taking Office everywhere. Core to our mobile first strategy is to ensure that our service endpoints are on every mobile device, and to that end, we have seen continued momentum with more than 100 million downloads of Office on iPhones, iPads and Android tablets. And with the release of Outlook on iOS and Android this quarter, updates through our OneDrive application and a preview of the forthcoming Office for Mac, we\u2019re making Office available to even more users on more devices. Bing achieved a significant milestone this quarter when U.S. search share topped 20% and search advertising revenue grew 21%. Search is key to productivity in work and life and it\u2019s a huge opportunity for Microsoft as we continue to innovate with Bing across our applications and platforms. On top of that, I\u2019m pleased with our renewed partnership with Yahoo! and our combined ability to compete more effectively in the search marketplace. Our investments in innovation and user experience in Xbox Live are paying off. Xbox Live users grew 18% year-over-year, helping drive increased Xbox Live usage growth by 30%. When I step back and look at Office 365, Bing search and Xbox Live collectively, I see real usage growth and monetization of our consumer services all up. Now let\u2019s talk about Windows. To start, our Windows revenue from business customers is stabilizing post the XP refresh anniversary, coming back in line to historical levels. We\u2019re also transforming the consumer Windows business to adapt to the changing market dynamics, including lower price point devices. This quarter, while non-Pro revenue declined, activations were up. Importantly, we are now at a place where we can start to see early signs of how usage increases in services like search and gaming can drive new monetization opportunities over the lifetime of a Windows consumer device. Windows is a tremendous asset for Microsoft, with more than 1.5 billion users. This means every day, hundreds of millions of people are using Windows and Windows applications. In fact, more than 60 million unique apps are used on a monthly basis from PCs running Windows 7 and later. We are focused on making Windows 10 the most loved version of Windows ever. Perhaps most importantly, last quarter, I talked about how Windows 10 will be a service across an array of devices and will usher in a new area era of more personal computing, an era where the mobility of the experience, not the device, is paramount. We look forward to sharing a lot more about Windows 10 at Build next week. In our device portfolio, service adoption continues across enterprise and consumer customers, with 44% revenue growth year-over-year. And 64% of Surface Pro 3 users use OneNote, nine times that of any other touch laptop. This shows how great hardware innovation influences customer experience and usage. We\u2019re looking forward to Surface 3 availability next month, a device that has received positive reviews for being a superior versatile device at a lower price point. We continue to demonstrate momentum in the Value Smartphone segment of the phone market, driving 18% growth in Lumia volume this quarter. However, we need to take further action to reduce our costs across devices as we execute on our Windows 10 first-party hardware plans. I\u2019m excited that next week, I\u2019ll be able to talk much more extensively about our ambitions and the opportunity ahead to two important audiences \u2013 developers at Build and our investor community at the Financial Analyst Briefing in San Francisco. Before I turn it over to Amy, I want to close by reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s transformation to a company that will thrive and help our customers thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. This is a new world with new growth. It\u2019s a world that requires fundamental transformation in products, business models and delivery models across Microsoft. In 2008, we started our transformation by taking an iconic franchise, Office, to the cloud. We took the next big step towards forwards five years ago when we launched Azure and another step forward with the recent announcement of Windows 10 as a service. Microsoft\u2019s overall transformation isn\u2019t about one-for-one shift. It is about delivering new value to more customers and unlocking new growth opportunities. To do this, we will continue to push forward with big ambitions and persistence while delivering solid performance. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter\u2019s results in greater detail, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our execution in the third quarter. In our Commercial business, we continued to see healthy underlying fundamentals with strong renewals of volume license annuity contracts, a mix shift to cloud offerings and solid bookings. Importantly, you can see the progress we are making in the execution of our cloud strategy as the percentage of our revenue from annuity contracts in our Commercial business continues to rise. As Satya highlighted, we also saw momentum in strategic businesses we\u2019ve been investing in, such as Bing, Xbox Live and Surface, which have a key role in our plans to further monetize Windows devices. Like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I will give growth rates in both GAAP and constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business demand. Revenue was $21.7 billion, up 6% and 9% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 1% and 4% in constant currency. We improved gross margin percentage year-over-year in each of our segments again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing focus on operational excellence. Operating income declined 5%. Adjusting for both integration and restructuring expense of $190 million, as well as the negative $87 million impact from FX, operating income declined 1%. Earnings per share was $0.61, which includes a $0.02 negative impact from FX and $0.01 of integration and restructuring expense. As a reminder, FX movements first impact our bookings growth and unearned revenue on the balance sheet. Each quarter, our contracted not-billed balance is adjusted to reflect current FX rates. When FX rates move rapidly, as they have in the last six months, bookings growth can be significantly impacted. This was the case again this quarter as bookings grew 2%. However, when measured on a constant currency basis, bookings grew 9%. Unearned revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $20.2 billion and 7% in constant currency. Total unearned revenue was slightly below expectations, driven primarily by a stronger-than-expected mix of sales that are recognized in the current period. From a geographic perspective the U.S. outperformed our expectations. This relative strength in the U.S. resulted in roughly one point less of constant currency impact than we expected in our Commercial business. China, Russia and Japan were generally in line with our expectations. I want to touch briefly on what we were seeing in Japan, given it\u2019s our second-largest market from a revenue perspective. Revenue was down $550 million, which is nearly four points of growth for the whole company. With high Office attach to PCs, revenue is particularly sensitive to the underlying PC market dynamics. Q3 was the toughest comparable due to both XP end of support and the VAT increase which went into effect last April 1. The impact is most evident in our DMC and Commercial Licensing segments. The macroeconomic climate remains challenging as well in Japan and we don\u2019t expect this to change in the short term. With that backdrop I will now moved to a detailed discussion of our results, starting with Windows. Q3 last year was the peak of the XP refresh cycle, evidenced by Windows Pro revenue growth of 19%. This growth significantly outpaced the underlying PC market driven by higher attach of Pro, particularly with large enterprise customers in developed markets. This quarter Pro revenue declined by 19% and is essentially flat to our Q3 FY 2013 levels as both business PCs and Pro mix in that segment returned to pre-XP refresh levels. For Windows non-Pro as we talked about last quarter, inventory in the channel was higher than normal. This quarter activations grew and we exited Q3 with channel inventories at more normal levels. This channel inventory reduction was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline. We continued to see a mix shift opening price point PCs which impacted license mix and aggregate ASP. However, it was significantly less than the impact in Q2 when holiday sales favored lower price point PCs. Office consumer revenue and D&C licensing was down 41% this quarter due primarily to the shift of purchasing toward Office 365 Consumer where we now have 12.4 million subscribers. This transition to Office 365 accounted for 27 points of that decline and the impact of Japan\u2019s PC market the remaining 14 points. Excluding Japan, we grew our combined consumer Office licenses by 10%. Revenue in our Devices and Consumer Other segment grew 25% and 28% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations. Many of our growth efforts are represented in this segment and we made terrific progress this quarter across Office 365, Bing and Xbox Live transactions. Gross margin expanded again, benefiting from the increased scale in our services. Inclusive of the estimated impact of the Yahoo! agreement reached last week, we remain confident in our goal of Bing profitability in FY 2016. Moving to hardware, revenue from Xbox consoles declined largely due to a mix shift of Xbox One consoles to lower ASP SKUs, as well as the impact of launch supply from a year ago. With Surface we saw 53% constant currency revenue growth driven by strong retail sales and attach of accessories. On phones we sold 8.6 million Lumia devices and have gained share in key markets such as the U.K. and Germany over the course of the year. Gross margin declined sequentially, driven by lower Q3 revenue and approximately $60 million of negative impact from foreign currency relative to Q2 FX rates. We\u2019ve made significant progress in reducing the operating expense base in the Phone business, moving from an annualized rate of $4.5 billion at acquisition to a run rate under $2.5 billion. That said, the changing mix of our portfolio to the value segment and the significant negative headwind from FX will impact our ability to reach operational breakeven in FY 2016. In response we have in Q3 and will continue in Q4 to aggressively focus on our operating cost base by pursuing efficiencies in both COGS and operating expenses. We will focus those efforts across our entire first party device portfolio, even while we expand into new form factors such as Whole Lens and Surface hub. Now moving to our commercial results, where revenue grew 5% or 7% in constant currency. Commercial bookings declined 1% on a reported basis but grew 10% in constant currency. The underlying health of the business remains very strong despite the negative impact from specific geos and prior-year XP comparables. The transition of our customers to cloud and subscription annuity services is a critical element of our business transformation. To provide ongoing transparency into our progress we\u2019ve added a new KPI commercial annuity mix. This quarter 82% of our commercial revenue came from annuity revenue streams which is up 5 points from last year. While quarter-to-quarter the mix can vary with uneven growth rates we\u2019ve seen in transactional licensing before and after the XP refresh cycle. The overall trend clearly reflects the meaningful progress that we have made. Office commercial products and services declined 2% but grew 1% in constant currency. Japan was a three-point drag. We successfully renewed a large volume of annuity contract expirations in Q3 at healthy levels in line with historical rate. And we continue to see a strong shift from traditional licensing to Office 365 across our business customers. In each of the last three quarters we have added more Office 365 seats than transactional licenses with SMB customers. Server products and services continued to exhibit strong momentum with revenue growth of 12% and 16% in constant currency. Our portfolio is well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers for their private, public and hybrid cloud solutions. Adoption of our premium products remains strong and revenue grew 25% across our premium offerings for SQL, System Center and Windows Server. Overall, revenue from our commercial cloud services more than doubled again this quarter. Enterprise penetration is accelerating with over half of all agreements signed during the quarter including cloud services. Within Office 365 premium workload now make up more than 50% of the install base and we are seeing strong attach of our enterprise mobility solutions to Office 365. As our usage grew rapidly this quarter and Dynamics CRM online benefited from strong customer growth. Moving now to operating expenses which were favorable to our guidance driven by decisions that we made during the quarter to reduce spending and to continue to reallocate resources to accelerate growth in key areas. For instance, in markets where we are facing challenges, we reduced our sales and marketing expense to reflect the current environment and as I mentioned earlier in my comments on our phone business, we took further actions to lower our cost base. Across the company we continue to prioritize and reallocate our spend to activities with the highest impact. The result was that operating expenses grew 4% for the company. Normalizing for the approximately $300 million year-over-year benefit from FX and the addition of $570 million related to phone, operating expenses grew just 1%. Our effective tax rate was 24%, which is 5 points higher than last year. The increase is primarily driven by the inclusion of our phone results and our changing geographic mix. We returned $7.5 billion to shareholders this quarter which is an increase of $3 billion from Q2. This change is consistent with our objective to increase capital return to shareholders with the focus on value. With that overview the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll start with a few overall comments for additional context. The guidance that we are providing is based on current FX rates and should actual rates differ they will be reflected in our financial results. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected in our unearned revenue as is it is based on rates when the contract is billed and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized generally over the next year. In Q4 unearned revenue will reflect three quarters of billings with the stronger U.S. dollar which will negatively impact year-over-year comparables. Likewise, we\u2019ll be recognizing a higher percentage of revenue from periods with the stronger U.S. dollar in both the recently completed Q3 and also the prior-year comparisons. In total, we expect FX will impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q4 with the majority of that impact in our Commercial segment. While XP-related comparables remain tough for Q4, we are starting to anniversary the XP benefits from last year. And finally, from a geographic perspective, we expect the year-over-year declines in Japan to continue. With that additional context, I\u2019ll now move to more specific guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, in Q4 last year, we recognized $382 million of revenue related to the end of the commercial agreement with Nokia, which will impact year-over-year growth trends. For this Q4, we expect revenue to be $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This range reflects the anniversary of XP, the impact of the Japanese economy and an anticipated draw-down of inventories in the PC ecosystem ahead of the release of Windows 10 this summer. Within consumer Office, we expect similar trends to Q3, including the continued transition to Office 365 subscriptions. In Computing and Gaming Hardware, with the addition of Surface 3, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with continued momentum in value smartphones and anticipated declines in non-Lumia phones. Gross margins will reflect similar dynamics to Q3. In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion with continued growth in Bing, Office 365 and Xbox Live transactions. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion with a continuing shift to annuity. This range reflects roughly four points of negative impact from FX in addition to the factors I discussed earlier. In Commercial Other, we expect momentum to continue in our commercial cloud with revenue $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion. And in Corporate, we don\u2019t expect any revenue impact. We expect COGS to be $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments. We expect operating expenses to be $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion. This range implies that our full-year operating expenses will be roughly $2 billion below our initial guidance for the year while still investing in key growth opportunities across R&D and sales. We have benefited from FX, but the biggest driver has been our ongoing cost discipline and prioritization efforts. In Q4, we expect to incur $100 million integration expenses and, separately, another $100 million in restructuring expenses. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million. We expect our Q4 tax rate to be 22% to 24%. In Q4, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing Cloud business. And we expect unearned revenue will grow sequentially, in line with historical seasonality, excluding the foreign currency impact. In closing, as you heard from Satya, we are making progress in our strategic goals and we are seeing are focused investments land in differentiated products, customer usage and sales results. Customers are seeing and embracing our innovation, leading to increased usage of our cloud services and a transition towards subscription and multiyear purchasing. We continued to invest aggressively to capture opportunities where we see competitive advantage while also becoming more efficient to accelerate our pace of innovation. We encourage you next week to watch the webcast of keynotes from our Build developer conference. We will share more of the innovation happening with Windows 10 and our cloud services. We\u2019ll also host our financial analyst briefing, where Satya, Kevin Turner and I will discuss how the company\u2019s transformation provides unique growth opportunities that drive increased lifetime customer value across our core businesses. We look forward to sharing that progress with you. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris for Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. You had great momentum in the cloud. I was curious if you could just talk about the positioning in both in on trend and cloud environments? And also weave in what you\u2019re seeing with Azure.\nSatya Nadella: Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. Overall when I think about the Microsoft cloud it\u2019s really the combination of Office 365 dynamics as well as Azure. We think about our capital allocation that way, we think about our utilization product architecture and customer value and how uniquely we can bring these three assets together to serve our customers well. And that\u2019s the momentum you see and I talked about the run rate, the usage metrics and there\u2019s really increasing intensity of usage amongst organizational customers in our commercial cloud. One of the other things also is a huge benefit for us is, because our cloud, our public cloud runs on our software assets, our software asset gets packaged up as our servers. In fact, I think of our servers as the edge of our cloud. So the unique capability we now have in Windows Server, SQL Server is becoming that much more competitive. Because we\u2019re running our public cloud in it and that\u2019s what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. And so you see there\u2019s two sides of benefits and two sides for us. One is in our cloud momentum, which itself is the combination of SAS applications, paths , and IADs which I believe is unique in the marketplace as well as with the software itself is packaged up into our private cloud offering be it Windows Server or SQL Server and they\u2019re becoming increasingly competitive in the enterprise and data center additions. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen in our commercial results, both on the licensing side as well as on the cloud side.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Brett. We\u2019ll move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 because some of those metrics really jumped out to us. It seems like overall revenue between commercial and E&D for Office 365 is up over 100%. If you look at the consumer user count is up pretty huge this quarter-to-quarter there. The question is sort of about Satya and Amy. Satya when you think about the positioning and sort of where we are in just the adoption lifecycle of Office 365 on the consumer side and then the SMB and enterprise. Where are we in terms of the inflection point there? And then Amy, how should we think about going forward in terms of the guidance that you gave how we should think about the financial implications of where we are in that transition from off-premise to the Office 365?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, and Amy you could take it from there. Overall I would say there\u2019s a secular movement that\u2019s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it\u2019s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships. Because those of a long-term contracts relationships we want to have with our customers be it consumer, be it small business or large customers. In all the years I\u2019ve been at Microsoft it was always our dream to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses. But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required. Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises. That\u2019s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers. And it\u2019s new penetration, so it\u2019s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up. They may have consumed one or two workloads but now they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio and not just that. If you look at the products in Office 365 that we have, take eDiscovery it\u2019s a complete new space for us where we are able to do things in security eDiscovery enterprise management that we didn\u2019t even do for the top end of the enterprise in the service side, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\nAmy Hood: And, Phil, on the math that sits behind that, it\u2019s a good timing. Next week at the financial analyst briefing, I\u2019ll send the \u2013 and have a lot more time to explain the actual lifetime value of each of these customer segments, especially in Office 365. But I think in consumer, it\u2019s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan. Our ability to quickly, I think, move our customer base through stronger execution, both direct through retail and having our channel execute well and partner with us on this transition. I do think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. And maybe more importantly, we continue to innovate in the product and deliver value to the end user, which is really what matters. And so I think we\u2019ll be able to show the progress we\u2019ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward. So I look forward to having the chance to spend more time on that in detail. And SMB looks very similar in some ways. They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads. So I think those are some of the bigger transitions you\u2019ve seen for us in terms of being able to increase the value. So hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to give you more details on that next week.\nPhilip Winslow: I\u2019ve been waiting for those details for years. I appreciate that. All right. Thanks, guys.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Phil. Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. I think one of the highlights of the past year has definitely been the expense control, and I guess you could call it, like a normalized OpEx growth of just 1% in the quarter, continues to be very impressive. How should investors, and how should we think about the sustainability of that expense control. Or how long can you keep sort of investing for these growth initiatives, like cloud, yet keep your overall OpEx growth rate so low on a go forward basis?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, and then I\u2019ll have Amy add. Overall, the core of how I want us to approach expenses is to make sure that we are not limited in our ability to invest in categories where we have unique things to, contribute. So we\u2019re going to do that though, with great discipline, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019ve seen us do over the course of the last year, and we\u2019ll continue to exhibit that. But at the same time, we will not shrink away from our ability to go put investment, be it in sales, marketing or product R&D, when we clearly have unique things in secular categories of growth. And that\u2019s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.\nAmy Hood: And I would just add, I generally think about two key items that we\u2019ve been able to think about, across the leadership team. First is, I think we have exhibited an increasing ability, over the course of the year, to reallocate during the year, both at the organization level and at the team level, to make sure our dollars are going to the highest ROI things. And secondly, I think it\u2019s a general belief held at the highest levels of the company, that operating efficiency increases our ability to be responsive, both to the needs of our customers, as well as innovate faster inside this place. And I think when you take those two things, along with what Satya said, being able to balance disciplined focus and execution for us, I think we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made.\nKeith Weiss: Yes. Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Keith. Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.\nRick Sherlund: Thank you. Satya, you mentioned, a year ago, that we\u2019re going to see a next generation of personal productivity software. I wonder if you could update us on what that means. And when we might see that as just an extension of Office 365? Or how do we monetize those products? And when will we hear more about them? And Amy, we didn\u2019t see any tech guarantees in the quarter for the upcoming Windows 10 launch, and we also haven\u2019t heard anything more about changes in accounting for Windows 10, given that there\u2019s going to be a big undelivered element there. Is that something we should expect to hear more about next week?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Let me start. Thanks, Rick. What I think about even just my own day-to-day usage of Office, even in the last year, it\u2019s gone through a drastic amount of change. Of course, I use Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, on a daily basis. But if I think about all the tools that I\u2019m using, which is all part of Office 365, today, on a daily basis and multiple times a day I start my day as I talked about in many conferences with Dell which is a tool I love which is in fact something that\u2019s uniquely possible because of the shift to Office 365 where we can take organizational data and breakthrough all the boundaries or, again, in silos inside an organization and have people discover information. It\u2019s the richest way for me to visualize what\u2019s happening at Microsoft in real time. That news feed for me is kind of the lifeblood of Microsoft. I use Power BI . One of the things that we talked a lot about is usage. In fact, one of the cultural changes inside the company is everyone from the frontline engineer to the frontline salesperson is responsible for usage. And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not are static reports and Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural language questions. I look at my own usage of one note in Surface. That\u2019s gone through a fee change both because of the hardware innovation, innovation in Windows, innovation in Office. I look at something like Sway which I\u2019m pretty excited about because basically we\u2019re taking the concept of what is an interactive document and the website and bringing it all together into these Sway documents if you well and if you\u2019re excited about what that could mean in customer service marketing or for school reports. So that\u2019s \u2013 we are well into it so that is not going to be waiting for some future date to release anything that\u2019s new, but we\u2019re well on our way with all of these tools and they\u2019re available today and we\u2019ll of course be iterating continuously.\nAmy Hood: And, Rick, on your other two questions specific to the tech guarantee that you would think about the time of year, due to the specific nature of the offer we have on Windows 10, there won\u2019t be a tech guarantee as you think about it for this upgrade cycle and there\u2019s disclosure in fact, in our revenue recognition section in the 10-Q that talks about that specifically. When we talk about the accounting for Windows 10, I will touch on that next week but as we get closer to the launch we\u2019ll go into more specifics. And I\u2019m so excited about the space. I don\u2019t want to miss this one other big scenario which is Cortana , that\u2019s perhaps the thing that\u2019s going to change personal productivity even most and especially with Windows 10 and how Cortana comes to Windows, both to the browser as well as to the start, I think it completely change what personal productivity software mean from a day-to-day experience as well.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking my question. So if Windows OEM Pro has now stabilized excluding the bump that we saw from XP Refresh and volume licensing at least in constant currency is stable growing, should we figure that we\u2019ve now started to turn the quarter on commercial Windows revenue? In addition, where do you think we are on the consumer side on the non-OEM front? Is that something that continue to shrink for a bit?\nAmy Hood: Let me take that one. Satya, you can add at the end of you want. No. I think, Mark, you\u2019re reading it correctly. We actually had our annuity volume licensing business as you know, has been showing growth and stability for a while as we talked about Pro is back to the pre-XP levels and while could see some fluctuation, I think this has been a very stable business for us for a long period of time when you take out that XP bump from last year. Talking about consumer, I think frankly Satya and I both reflected a bit on it in our comments. We do expect to see some additional inventory draw down in front of a launch. That\u2019s not unusual prior to a launch cycle and that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter. But I think as I look to 2016, I\u2019m excited about the designs we\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m excited about the products that are possible with Windows 10, and I think we feel good and are looking forward to sharing some of that excitement next week.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, the one thing I\u2019d also add is there is actually a much more fundamental transformation happening even with how we think about Windows and its delivery and we\u2019ll talk more about this even at our financial analyst briefing next week because I increasingly think about the lifetime value we can deliver to the user of a Windows device be it in consumer or even in the enterprise. And if you think about when we say Windows-as-a-service it\u2019s actually a pretty profound construct which involves us being able to not only think about what ships with OEMs, but how do we on a continuous basis, if it\u2019s a consumer we have things now in the store, we have subscriptions, we have gaming and then when it comes to the enterprise there\u2019s management, security, servicing which is all unique value. So there is going to be an increasing emphasis in the concept of lifetime value that we can deliver to customers.\nMark Moerdler: Perfect. I really do appreciate it.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Mark.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Mark. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks. Listen, it sounds like Cloud and Azure represents an opportunity to transition existing customers to a Cloud model, but also to expand your customer base or penetrate \u2013 or penetration into your current customer base with \u2013 I mean incremental business is what I\u2019m talking about. I would think that most of Office 365, because most people were already on Office, represents transition from life to license model, but so far, and I know it\u2019s still early, but so far what about the rest? Can you give us an idea of how much of this is new business and how much of this is transition business?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start and then you can add. I mean I think you have to sort of look at all the use cases. In fact as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, have been non-zero-sum because our people started building their mobile back end, web back end using Big Data not workloads we have. I look at sort of everyday usage growth, even if they\u2019re creating a web workload it\u2019s for a very different type of web back end and a mobile back end. And the same thing with advanced analytics. I even look at the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure. We not only see Windows Server obviously but we see 20%-plus of Linux growth. So that\u2019s again non-zero-sum . So there\u2019s significant traction we have in terms of moving beyond just one-for-one shift of a workload that traditionally ran on our server to our Azure Cloud. In fact if anything the majority of what we are seeing is new. Even in Office 365 it\u2019s not just one-for-one shift. Of course if you are \u2013 were using as a large enterprise Exchange and you moved to Office 365 you moved to using Exchange Online; same thing is true for SharePoint. But again take all the other things I described, power BI , Dell and the list goes on, take eDiscovery; even for the largest of enterprise these were things that had low penetration or low deployment. And so we are seeing increasing usage of that. Same thing with our Dynamics business. EMS , it\u2019s completely a new category. We never had that kind of a management footprint. We now have the ability to have one control plane for IT for all the devices, identity management, device management, data protection. That\u2019s a new workload. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the opportunity in everyone one of our offerings from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero-sum component to it.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks, Satya. Just want to be clear because you said something, I mean other than Office 365 did you say the majority of the Cloud business is new business? Or \u2013 and again, I know it can\u2019t be \u2013 I mean maybe you know exactly what it is but I\u2019m sure some of it is somewhat cloudy or \u2013 no pun intended, or vague, but do you think most of it at this point is new business? Is that what I heard you say?\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, and also it sort of comes in interesting ways because one of the things IT, as you know, it\u2019s not about sort of replacing what you have, it\u2019s always augmenting what you have. A very classic scenario would be I\u2019ll take a SQL database application, bring it to the Cloud and then build a new mobile back end using the same data. So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you would use some amount if iOS infrastructure and then past consumption. So that\u2019s one of the very typical enterprise solutions you will see. In fact, our own IT Systems, take what we have done with our HR and our financial systems and some of those things as they move to the Cloud, we bring some existing and then add to it.\nAmy Hood: And, John, to your specific question, you\u2019re right. A lot of the Azure is, the good way to think about that is new; and especially our Dynamics business, CRM online and some of the work we\u2019ve done across AX is certainly all new. And the lower down in the segment of Office you get, the more new it is, is the way to think about it.\nJohn DiFucci: Great. Thank you very much.\nChris Suh: Thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi. Just a follow up to the question John had on Azure. Amazon released their profitability for the first time on AWS and it was I think higher than most people were expecting. I\u2019m wondering how we should think about your mix of business in Azure? You\u2019re running Linux, you\u2019re running a lot of services based on open source software, you\u2019re also running some of your own IP there. How should we think about where your margins are today and should we think of Amazon\u2019s AWS margins as a good benchmark for where you could be at like sort of scale they\u2019re at today?\nSatya Nadella: First of all, I don\u2019t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me. I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud, so it\u2019s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value. So that means we have SaaS which is a huge component between O 365 and Dynamics, PaaS which is a huge component of Azure itself. We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS. So we \u2013 for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use \u2013 so your resources on AWS. And then of course we have our iOS business. So that\u2019s how we think about it. And then it\u2019s reflected even in our margins. So when we look at our Cloud margins, they will have our revenue quality, which is very different; that\u2019s a combination of past iOS and SaaS. And that\u2019s how we want to make sure we make progress, because that\u2019s where both product value which is unique to us and also the quality of revenue that\u2019s unique to us. But the one other thing that I \u2013 see my world view is not that all compute storage networks just goes to one place. That\u2019s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there\u2019s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive. Of course we don\u2019t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that\u2019s just pure public Cloud number and that\u2019s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way. But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what\u2019s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Walter.\nWalter Pritchard: Amy on OpEx, you have \u2013 I guess not necessarily you but the company generally at this time has given some color into the next fiscal year\u2019s OpEx. Is that something we should expect at the Build event with your Analyst Meeting next week? Or any \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to give it to us today but \u2013 or right here, but just wanted to figure out expectations around when we should hear about that?\nAmy Hood: We\u2019ll continue to talk generally about it. I don\u2019t expect to give specific guidance on FY 2016 next week.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay.\nAmy Hood: Okay, Walter.\nWalter Pritchard: Thank you very much.\nChris Suh: Thanks. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great. I had two questions. One was related to the success of the sub 250 machines that you guys in the market have been seeing and just what geos have seen the best uptake for those so far? And then just, if there is a little bit more color you can share about the drivers of the commercial licensing business and I\u2019ve recognized all the affiliate that you guys just gave guidance for Q4. But as kind of as we look out over the next year or two, what are the big puts and takes in particular maybe on the server and tool side that we need to think about?\nSatya Nadella: I\u2019ll start. I think as far as the low-cost devices, it\u2019s pretty broad. I think we think of the U.S. itself being in fact a big driver of some of the growth on the consumer side. We\u2019re also obviously \u2013 stimulated this so that we can be much more effective even in the educational markets worldwide. And Amy can add to that if we had any more detail on it. When it comes to our Commercial Licensing and our servers, it\u2019s the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that\u2019s happening is our enterprise and datacenter products, being Windows Server, Systems Centers , SQL Server, are more competitive. It\u2019s the same thing that I would say at least in the last couple of years clearly have played out. There is clearly \u2013 and in fact, as our products have become competitive there\u2019s been this mix shift. People have bought from us previously just standard editions are able to now look at our enterprise editions and that\u2019s what\u2019s playing out. And there\u2019s definitely some pricing action we were able to take, but mostly because we were able to deliver this incremental value. And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective are very competitive versus what\u2019s available in the market. So that\u2019s what we see. And so the cycle some of the pricing actions obviously were anniversary out, but the overall thing that I\u2019m focused on is how can we continue to run our software asset ourselves in public cloud and translate that into our servers. And really paint this vision and make it a reality of hybrid computing and drive the secular growth of that.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Heather.\nChris Suh: We\u2019ll have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yeah, Satya, I\u2019m wondering what inning do you think we are in terms of building out the next generation data centers but you\u2019ll need to support the commercial cloud. For example, do you think you\u2019ve built out data center capacity to support the commercial cloud business all the way to a $10 billion dollars run rate or $20 billion run rates? So if there\u2019s any way you can help us to try to gauge how much overhead you have in the capacity. And perhaps what type of data center footprint you envision a few years down the road.\nSatya Nadella: In fact, one of the big changes that has happened I would say in the last couple of years, and I\u2019ll have Amy even detail out. It\u2019s the way we\u2019re going about everything from the very long lead things like actual data center locations and Build out to the procurement of individual machines, and essentially the work in progress inventory of that. We have driven significant process improvement to essentially make it as efficient as one can make it and that\u2019s a continuous process for us. So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is. And we now have the ability to be much more dynamic. Surely there are some things which are long lead like data center location. But you don\u2019t need to build out data centers much before they\u2019re really being utilized. And so we have a very good process and that\u2019s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. And this is where the huge distinction is. After all we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing. But this business of supporting a highly geo distributed enterprise cloud business is very different than just running in one at scale public cloud service. And we learned a lot with what is our workload diversity as well as our geo-diversity. And our supply chain management is optimized for it.\nAmy Hood: Yeah, I would just add Mark. This is a place as Satya said we have made a lot of progress in being data-driven. This is down to a monthly review by workload, by property, by geo. And this is a place where I feel that we are in it terrific position frankly to respond to data sovereignty demands, changes politically and our ability to execute that to provide what our customers demand in terms of security and manageability and location. It\u2019s something that we also care a lot about.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks. Mark.\nChris Suh: So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. We encourage you to tune into Build, our Annual Developer Conference which will be webcast live at to be www.buildwindows.com as well as our Financial Analyst Briefing on Wednesday, April 29, which will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various Investor Conferences. Thank you for joining us, and talk to you soon. Goodbye.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone. Today I'll focus my topline thoughts on our progress this quarter and the progress we're making in transforming our business. This quarter we reached $26.5 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $7.8 billion. This quarter's results show the product and business transformation underway at Microsoft. We saw success in a number of our strategic areas including cloud adoption, redefining and revitalizing the Windows Ecosystem and improving economics in our hardware portfolio. We also saw some challenges this quarter. As expected, the one-time benefit of Windows XP end-of-life PC refresh cycle has now tailed off. Additionally, we ran into unexpected issues in select geographies. Where there are execution issues, we will address them. Where there are macroeconomic challenges, we will weather them. With that in mind, I'll walk you through the quarter. Let's start with our Cloud business, an area where we're extending our leadership position and accelerating our innovation. In commercial cloud, we saw continued customer and revenue growth across a growing footprint of cloud services, Office 365, Azure, Enterprise Mobility Suite and Dynamic CRM Online. In fact this quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of triple digit revenue growth in commercial cloud and we're now at a run rate of $5.5 billion. Azure services continue to grow in appeal to enterprise IT and developers with rapid improvements across hybrid services, premium cloud storage and virtual machine offerings, enhanced data and data analytics offerings. Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suite is one key area of product innovation that I would like to highlight given the growth and the uniqueness of this offering. Microsoft offers a comprehensive solution for all devices that brings together mobile device management, mobile application management, hybrid identity management and data protection into one unified offering through EMS. Office 365 now includes new application experiences on all phones and tablets for mobile productivity. Further we've released completely new scenarios. This includes Office Sway for visualizing and sharing ideas, Delve to help search and discover content, Office 365 Groups to make it easier to collaborate, Office 365 Video for secure media streaming for businesses. Finally we continue to invest in enterprise value by integrating MDM and Enterprise Mobility Suite into Office 365. New encryption technologies, compliance certification and new e-discovery capabilities in exchange. In Dynamic CRM Online, we added 53 markets this quarter, bringing us to 130 markets around the world. We're bringing together CRM with Cortana, Yammer, Power BI and Skype to add unique value to customers. We're expanding our capabilities in the Cloud through five new acquisitions. Last week we announced an agreement to purchase revolution analytics, the leading provider of statistical computing and predictive analytics, which will enable our customers to unlock big data in size. We bought HockeyApp, a leading mobile app testing and development service to enhance Azure services for mobile developers. Our acquisition of [Orato] [ph] accelerates our ability to give customers unique security capabilities by tapping into behavioral intelligence on identity and access spanning on-premise and the cloud. We're bringing on new capabilities in machine learning as applied to e-Discovery and other enterprise compliance processes with the acquisition of Equivio and we also welcomed Acompli, a provider of innovative mobile email applications for IOS and Android. The common theme across all these acquisitions is advanced data analytics and machine learning driven capabilities that improve with more customer adoption and usage of the cloud. We're also making progress in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 home and personal revenue grew nearly 150% year-over-year as we added 2.1 million net new subscribers since last quarter. Bing U.S. search share continues to grow, as does search revenue with 23% growth this quarter. I will talk about our progress in Xbox live later in my comments. Now let's turn to Windows. To start, the overall Windows Ecosystem is driving more innovation. Over the holiday season at SCES, our partner showcased a diverse lineup of Windows devices, including more premium device choices than ever. Last spring we made a strategic decision to introduce new Windows pricing programs to drive unit growth in opening price point PCs as well as tablets and this quarter year-over-year growth. Also businesses continue to value Windows. We're seeing healthy demand for Windows Pro even though we faced challenging prior year comparables in Q2 as well as in the second half of the year, following the Windows XP end of support related PC refresh. Now let's talk about Windows 10. Last week was an important milestone on our path to release Windows 10 and ushering an era of more personal computing. The heritage of Windows was about enabling one single device, the PC. With Windows 10, we're building a device platform for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. It's a world where the mobility of a person's experience is paramount, requiring a platform that spans devices from small screens to large screens, to no screens at all. It's a world where interacting with technologies as natural as interacting with other people and it's a world that demands trust and security. It is also a world with rich opportunity for developers and Windows 10 will be the most attractive windows development platform ever, with our free upgrade offer and with universal application and unified store for developers, we'll have a large unified up to date user base to target. We want people to love Windows and have made this our most collaborative project yet with more than two million insiders giving us feedback every day. I am very optimistic about Windows 10. We're making progress with our own devices, for those in the market today and also the ones that we've recently announced. This quarter we surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark with surface for the first time. The value proposition of being the most productive tablet is resonating. Further the sales for Lumia phones top 10 million units growing 30% year-over-year this quarter with strength in devices such as Lumia 500 and 600 series, our affordable smartphone. In this segment of the market, the combination of our brand and value standout and we plan to continue to build a beachhead here. We're also creating new device types that open up new markets and opportunities for Microsoft. In October we launched our first wearable, the Microsoft band and just last week we revealed two new hardware with Windows 10 with Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft Surface Hub will revolutionize group collaboration and meetings, HoloLens and Windows holographic computing will make mix reality applications part of everyday life across work and home. I want to talk briefly about Xbox. Xbox One console adoption accelerated this holiday and was the top-selling console in the U.S. and fans on Xbox Live were engaged with the service more than ever before. However, it's our strategies coming together with Windows 10 that give me the greatest optimism. The vibrant social gaming community on Xbox Live will span Xbox, Windows PC, Tablets and phones. With Windows 10 gamers on a PC, tablet or Xbox console can play together and games on Xbox One can easily stream through a Window 10 PC or tablet. It's also getting clear how games people love today will evolve to mind-blowing experiences in the future when designed for mixed reality that Windows 10 and HoloLens create. Just imagine what's possible with Minecraft. Gaming truly is a valuable part of millions of people's lives and Microsoft will excel and increase our lead. Before closing, I wanted to share a few thoughts on capital allocation. Over the past several quarters and certainly with last week's Windows 10 announcements you've seen us unleash new innovation in our cloud services with Windows and our hardware. We did all of this without materially growing our cost base. This required clarity and purpose and value proposition, realignment of talent and disciplined execution. Our increasing innovation and competitiveness in today's growth markets and the creation of new categories is how we will most positively impact the returns for our investors. Earlier today, we announced our intention to complete the existing $40 billion share repurchase authorization by December 31, 2016. This is another step in our ongoing commitment to increase capital return for our shareholders while investing in the growth of our business. It too shows our optimism for the future growth of Microsoft. As we move forward we will certainly continue to be thoughtful in our capital return decisions balanced across dividends and share repurchases. In closing, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation to become the productivity and platform company with a mobile mobile-first, cloud-first world. I'm proud of how our teams are stepping up to both change and execute to make this transformation happen. I'm confident of the decisions and choices we're making to drive our business and products forward to serve our customers and partners in the future. With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through the quarter's results in further detail and share our outlook for the next quarter. I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer your questions. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. As Satya shared in Q2 we again made solid progress on our business transformation. We had strong growth in our cloud and subscription businesses, our annuity renewals were healthy as customers remained committed to our enterprise portfolio and our hardware products performed well during the holiday season. As we expected our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the prior year benefits that we realized in our OEMs and office transactional businesses following the Windows XP end of support refresh cycle. Beyond that, our results in China and Japan fell short of our expectations. In Japan, the PC market lagged due to the macroeconomic environment along with the combined impact of XP end of support and the VAT increase last year. Our Office attach rate to PCs is very high there, so the weak PC market also impacted Office revenue. With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter. Revenue was $26.5 billion up 8% and would have been one point better without the impact of foreign exchange. Gross margin grew slightly this quarter even when comparing against a year ago that benefited from the XP Refresh cycle. Our commitment to ongoing execution improvement and thoughtful folio management helped improve the gross margin percentage in each of our operating segments. Operating income declined 2% which included $243 million of integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that, operating income grew 1%. Our reported GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, which included $0.02 negative impact from integration and restructuring expense and $0.04 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Foreign exchange had $0.01 negative impact on EPS. As we discussed last quarter, FX movement first impact of bookings growth and unearned revenue on our balance sheet are contracted but not billed balance was adjusted down to reflect current FX rates. Therefore our bookings were flat this quarter. Unearned revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $21.2 billion, but the sequential decline was slightly larger -- slightly higher than we expected due to the larger than anticipated impact from FX. Adjusting for that FX impact our commercial unearned balance is in line with historical trends and our expectations. From a geographic perspective relative to our expectations the U.S. outperformed in Europe was generally in line. As I mentioned earlier, China and Japan were below our expectations. With that backdrop I will now move to a detailed discussion of our results. Last year we ended support for Windows XP. That simulated a PC Refresh cycle in particular in developed market and with business customers. During the period from Q2 through the end of our fiscal year Windows Pro revenue growth was over 10% and meaningfully outpaced business PC growth. As expected in Q2 PCs have reverted to a more normal live mix between developed and emerging markets and Pro attached Business PCs has returned to the levels we saw prior to FY '14. Also to drive revenue growth in academic institutions we lowered the price of Windows Pro for that customer segment. This pricing change along with the impact of XP caused Windows revenue growth to be lower than the relatively stable business PC market we have seen the end of FY '13. We again grew Window non-Pro licenses and saw year-over-year growth in activations. This was driven by particularly strong demand for opening price point PCs related to the strategic decisions Satya just spoke of earlier. The harbor mix shift opening price point PCs impacted license mix and therefore aggregate revenue per license in the quarter. The mixed shift was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline. Inventory in the channel is a bit higher than normal which we expect to work through in Q3. Office consumer products and services revenue declined 12% and was impacted by the ongoing transition to Office 365 and by the dynamics in Japan where PC growth was lower than we expected in a geography where the paid attractive Office is high. Adoption of Office 365 home and personal remained strong and we now have over 9.2 million subscribers. In our computing and gaming segment we are proud of the continued progress we are making in our service portfolio. Strong interest in Surface Pro 3 helped to drive record revenue as well as improved gross margins. Surface Pro 3 volumes are pacing over three times the rate of what we saw for Surface Pro 2. In gaming, Xbox One was the console sales leader in the U.S. Xbox live users grew and those users increased their purchases of third party publisher content and consumables. Sales of the Xbox platform exclusive Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Forza Horizon 2 were strong and this quarter we welcome Minecraft. We articulated our plan for the phone business back in July and we are executing to plan. With our Lumia portfolio of phones we are driving volumes in the low priced device category. We sold 10.5 million Lumia phones this quarter an all-time high. We also sold over 39 million non-Lumia phones even while we make changes to the product portfolio and manage this business for profitability. We are looking forward to bringing new products to market that will showcase the features that we presented at our Windows 10 event last week. Revenue in our devices and consumer other segment grew 30%. As noted earlier, Xbox Live transactions and first party game performed well and contributed to this growth. Additionally, search revenue growth was strong with improvements in both rate and volumes. Within display, revenue declined our MSN portal though we saw revenue growth across other Microsoft properties. We are also pleased by our gross margin expansion in this segment. Transitioning now to our consumer results where revenue grew 5%. Our annuity revenue remained strong growing double-digits and renewal rates remained high. Customers are continuing to move from transactional purchasing to long-term annuity contracts as they showed increased commitment to our product roadmap. Our transactional revenue declined over 15%, slightly more than we expected primarily in Office and mostly due to our performance in China and Japan, which I detailed earlier. Additionally, FX had a greater negative impact on commercial revenue than we had anticipated. Our commercial cloud services delivered triple digit revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Office 365 continues to be priority for CIOs as both existing and new customers move to the cloud. This transition accelerated with 45% of our renewal season Office moving to the cloud this quarter. We are seeing great growth in revenue from premium Azure services driven by both increasing customer base and an expansion in the number of services that those customers deploy. Within Dynamic CRM Online, customer growth accelerated and revenue nearly doubled. From a product perspective, commercial Office product and services revenue declined 1%, slightly below our expectations. Annuity revenue remained strong with high renewal rates and continued adoption of Office 365. Within our Office transactional business year-on-year comparables are difficult given the benefits from last year's XP Refresh where customers chose to update their desktop productivity solutions along with their PC. Additionally the shift to Office 365 continues to impact transactional revenue. While these dynamics were consistent with our expectations, revenue in China and Japan both fell short given the factors that I noted earlier. Server products and services revenue grew 9%, again outpacing the broader IT markets. Growth in premium mix helped to drive double-digit revenue growth in SQL Server and system center. Windows Server annuity revenue grew double-digits again this quarter. Our transactional revenue was down primarily due to a declining traditional server market. Additionally, we are pleased with the performance in our Dynamics business which grew revenues 13% driven by growth in both on premises and cloud offerings. Operating expense grew 1% to $8.3 billion and was favorable to our expectation. These results are inclusive of investments that we made in our strategic growth areas, a few of which were showcased last week at our Windows 10 event. Excluding approximately $750 million from the addition of NDS operating expense would have declined 8%. Relative to the guidance that we provided for the quarter, roughly half of the favorability resulted from FX changes with the balance driven by our continued prioritization of spend. Our integration and restructuring efforts have been focused on optimizing resources across the company which includes reducing the expense base in our phone business. To date, we have integrated the manufacturing and supply chain teams across Microsoft while also rationalizing our phone manufacturing capacity. In operating expense we committed to reducing $1 billion from the phone cost base which we have done. We continue to look for opportunities to drive further efficiencies. Our effective tax rate was 25% and higher than expected due to previously mentioned income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of phone results and our changing geographic mix. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion driven primarily by investments to increase our capacity as we expanded existing and added new data centers, as well as made server purchases and support of our fast-growing cloud business. This quarter we increased our capital return by 5% with $4.5 billion returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and as Satya reinforced in his comments we will continue to take thoughtful steps to increase capital return to shareholders with a focus on value. With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook. Our guidance is based on our current view of FX rates. Should the U.S. dollar strengthen beyond those assumptions as it did this quarter, we would see additional negative impact to earnings, revenue, our balance sheet and our contracted but not billed balance. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected on our revenue, which is recorded at rate when the contract is billed, then revenue comes onto the P&L at that same rate as it is recognized, generally over the next year. Therefore in Q3 we will start to recognize a higher percentage of revenue from periods with a stronger U.S. dollar than the prior-year comparison. In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q3. The majority of this impact is in our commercial business. In FY '14 it was our Q2 through Q4 results that most benefited from Windows XP end of support. As such, our growth rates across Windows Pro and transactional Office will be impacted as our business moves back to pre-XP levels. On a geographic basis, we expect year-on-year revenue declines in China, Russia and Japan. In Japan Q3 represents an even tougher comparison with the anniversary of the VAT, which again will create different comparables, difficult comparables in Windows and Office. We currently expect that these geographic dynamics, challenging comparables from XP and FX headwinds will be in place throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. With that overall background, let me move to our specific Q3 guidance starting with devices and consumer. Our revenue guidance includes approximately four points of drag from FX. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range seems the more challenging comparables I mentioned earlier. The range also includes a reduction in channel inventory for Windows non-Pro opening price point PCs. Within consumer Office we expect to see similar trends to Q2 and within our IP licensing business we expect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices filled by our licensees. In computing and gaming we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. This range reflects normal seasonality coming out of the holidays for our Xbox and Surface businesses. In phone hardware we expect revenue to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This range anticipates accelerating year-over-year growth in Lumia units driven by our affordable smartphone devices. We also expect both volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to continue to decline in Q3. With this lower aggregate revenue base, we expect gross margins, which include non-cash amortization to be lower for the next couple of quarters. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $2 billion reflecting continued progress in key areas like Office 365 Home and Personal, Xbox Live and Search. In our commercial business we expect our significant momentum in annuity and commercial cloud services to continue. Within our commercial licensing segment we expect revenue to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion. In addition to the factors that I discussed, which impact our year-over-year comparability, we anticipate a four-point drag from FX. In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Even after considering the impact of FX, growth will remain robust with expected momentum across our commercial cloud portfolio, Office 365 Azure and CRM Online and in corporate, we don't expect any revenue impact. As we continue to work towards the launch of Windows 10, we will share additional detailed information regarding any accounting impacts from the Windows 10 free upgrade offer and Windows as a service. I would like to reiterate that our OEM royalty model, which is paid upfront will remain in place. We expect COGS to be $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion with variability driven by both hardware segments. We expect third-quarter operating expense to be $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion. We are lowering our full-year guidance to $33.2 billion to $33.6 billion which reduces full-year growth including NDS to 4% to 5%. Our Q3 plans include investments in advertising and customer facing roles to continue to accelerate our momentum with commercial products such as SQL and the cloud. These investments are a direct result of prioritization decisions made during first half. Over the remainder of the fiscal year we expect to incur an additional $200 million of restructuring expense. This results in total charges of roughly $1.4 billion which is lower than our previous guidance. Separately, we still expect integration expense of $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect other income and expense to be negative $100 million in Q3. We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 22% and 24%, this includes the Q2 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment as well as the changing geographic mix of our business. In Q3 we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business. Unearned revenue will continue to benefit from customers moving to our subscription services and high contract renewal rates. We expect to see low single-digit sequential decline in our unearned for Q3 which includes one point drag from FX as new billings will reflect the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our commercial unearned balance will follow recent historical seasonality when adjusted for FX. In closing, this quarter was another example of the progress that we are making across this company. Our execution continues to improve and we are making data-driven decisions to improve more investments both shorter-term as you have seen in our marketing and sales adjustments as well as for the longer-term as we adjust our product portfolio. There are certainly short-term comparability challenges as we anniversary last year's XP Refresh cycle and see the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, but we are confident in the underlying health of our business out of the significant innovation we are funding within our prioritized operating budgets and excited to continue gaining share in key strategic markets. Before I hand it back over to Chris, I would like to announce that we will be webcasting a briefing for the investor community on April 29, in conjunction with our Build Developer Conference in San Francisco. We will share more details as we get closer to the date. With that, I will turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. With that, we will now move to the Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. I appreciate. Amy, can you give us a bit more details on what's driving the increase in cloud margins within the commercial other segment as well as any sense for how accretive the cloud is becoming? And then I have a follow-up question.\nAmy Hood: Sure, why don\u2019t I talk a little bit about that from a math perspective and I'll let Satya add from some more engineering improvements, which I think are important. Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud environment, that is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth. In addition, we've done a lot of hard engineering work I believe over the past six quarters to be able to take advantage of more utilization and capacity over time and I'll let Satya maybe add a little bit technically.\nSatya Nadella: Overall, the shift to the higher layer services is the real driver here, which is obviously Office 365 and its various levels is one factor. The other one is what I talked about in the Enterprise Mobility Suite, that's really got fantastic momentum in the marketplace because the solution has really come together and is fairly unique, as well as Dynamic CRM. So these are all got a different profile in terms of margin and they are all now pretty high growth businesses for us. So when you think about our cloud, you got to think about the low-level infrastructure. Even there we now have premium offerings and then we have higher level services. So that aggregate portfolio is what helps us move up the margin curve.\nMark Moerdler: Excellent and one quick follow-up, how should we think about monetization Satya for the Windows devices sub 9 inch?\nSatya Nadella: One of the comments I had made in my remarks was some momentum we're seeing in our consumer cloud services. So for example, the store monetization, Bing monetization, Xbox Live monetization as Xbox Live monetization as Xbox Live now in fact is going to span devices are all things that drive monetization for below 9 inches. So I think of device gross margin in some cases because we are building devices like the phones as well as this post sale monetization using our consumer cloud services as the two additional levers that we have in order to be able to monetize Windows devices.\nChris Suh: Excellent, thank you, I appreciate Mark.\nChris Suh: We'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Amy, just on the XP tail-off, are there other commercial products that you're seeing being impacted? I just wanted be clear there are a lot of questions that is there some type of Halo impact from the XP taking drop down on the other solutions?\nAmy Hood: Sure Brent, thanks for the question. I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last year when the impact was happening, so let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components again. Obviously there's a very direct impact, which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro and its mix would attach to business PCs. The other important component of that was when people bought a PC as we talked through the year, they often took the chance whether generally in the business segment which impacts in our world commercial licensing as a reporting unit to buy Office and generally on a non-annuity basis. So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase that was driven a year ago as the first externality, the second was in Windows [DL] [ph] we also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows DL which again is in our commercial licensing segment. So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. If you think about it from our reporting segments it's the D&C licensing segment as well as our commercial licensing segment and specifically our transactional revenue growth year-over-year.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And just a quick follow-up, just on the reduction in operating expenses for the full year, is this across the Board Amy? Is there a particular area that you're finding more opportunity to cut?\nAmy Hood: Brent, thanks again. I actually think of it as a general concept. I think really we're trying to invest behind opportunities where we see them. Some of those are more public as we talk about in terms of our sales and marketing adjustments or Ad campaigns that we run by the commercial cloud. Others I think you don't have the opportunity to see until we launch products like we did last week where we were able to reassert our product portfolio and really move our talent to invest in, I guess mind blowing is the word Satya used, in terms of product portfolio in that way. So I'm not sure that all of it Brent I would say is across a line in that way. They're short-term optimizations and longer-term portfolio optimizations that I think we've talked about this before. I think the entire Senior Leadership Team views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest and I think we've made great progress as a team and I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: And I will just add that we're also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of our engineering teams and that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments. So there is significant I would say combination of culture change as well as how we work change that drives more innovation for the same dollar.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Brent. We will move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi thanks. Two questions, just one on execution it sounds like you highlighted some issues in Japan and we've heard about VAT from companies. Can you just talk about what you're doing to address some of those issues and is there any concern that that might spread beyond what you've seen in Japan and China?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Walter. Is that both your questions, I just want to make sure I get them?\nWalter Pritchard: No, I'm just trying to understand generally that issue, I had one other, but it's just on\u2026\nSatya Nadella: I'll just start by just talking about China. We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through. We're very committed to China as a market. We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know.\nAmy Hood: And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us. So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our under C&B balances and that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in commercial licensing, but when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt quite good from our commercial perspective.\nWalter Pritchard: And then just question on the Office 365 commercial, can you talk about deployment rates. I know you've done a good job of getting those into contracts, how many customers are actually running it, running their email and share point and other products in the cloud versus just having the rights to it.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Walter. I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud. The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously exchange. It happens also come with directory implementation and so we generally think of a fast deployment also and then adding on workloads and premium workflow cycles. And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite. So while I think there is always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customers show to the movement to the cloud and then moving them quickly as we can, but also at their own pace through deployment.\nWalter Pritchard: Great. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Walter.\nChris Suh: We'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking our question. I just wanted to dig into Windows OEM ASPs a little bit and just trying to sort of better understand the dynamic theme of what we see in the marketplace when we look at industry analysts that we're looking at basically sort of flat to slightly down unit growth and the down 13% OEM revenue growth that you guys are seeing. Some of this mix and some of this ASP, I was wondering if you could help us with a little bit more color in terms of exactly what that ASP dynamic is going on in terms of these lower entry level additions what's that doing to the overall ASP of what you're able to extract from the market?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Keith. I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I wasn\u2019t sure which category you were talking about. Let me start at the highest level, which is if I work at industry analyst as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms of PC unit health across business, which has been stable since FY '13 and across consumer where we see meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one. So then I'll take a second and talk about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth. Let me start first in Pro. There they're really two key dynamics, the first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh. They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. It is a return to the attach level we saw before. The component that actually has impacted -- the second component in Pro that is a quote unquote \u201cASP/mix comment\u201d is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number. So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment. When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments, which is we saw device growth in low price devices opening price points, we actually made I believe a strategic decision to increase our ability to put devices on the shelf, especially at retail at prices under $200 to $249 is how to think about the price points that were the most impacted. We do have the Windows with things skewed there. It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM licenses, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel. And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about.\nKeith Weiss: And if I could squeeze in one follow-up, have you guys done any assessment in terms of the set you're seeing in Surface Pro 3 definitely is a real productivity device. To what extent is that cannibalistic from what would have been Windows PC sales and to what extent do you think you're expanding the market opportunity with that device?\nSatya Nadella: I think it's definitely expanding the market opportunity. One of the things that I feel very good about is the risk we took to introduce the two-in-one category and I feel now that we see that in fact inspire even a lot of activity in our own OEM ecosystem and we see many good designs coming because it's viewed as a category that drives growth. And so from that perspective I feel good about leading because that's one of our strategic goals, which is we want to create new categories, foster more demand for the entire ecosystem.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you very much guys.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nChris Suh: We'll take the next question please operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.\nRick Sherlund: Thanks for Satya, could you talk about the implications of Windows 10 for a moment? I am thinking in terms of the new platform for innovation and maybe you can talk about post-sale monetization. What do you think the impact is on demand in the industry and the opportunities for Microsoft around the new platform?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Rick for the question. As I said in my remarks, I am very optimistic about what Windows 10 means for our customers, partners and Microsoft. The core idea of Windows 10 is to build a device operating system that spans the gamut from no screens to small screens, to PCs and even large screens. In fact if you look at our innovation, we're perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we're doing with Surface Hub, Hollow Lands as well as some of the two-in-one form factors. So overall I think the most strategic objective for us is to get developer momentum with Windows 10 and that's where we're focusing on with a lot of different actions. One is the one unified developer platform, which I think is perhaps the most strategic piece of Windows 10 along with the unified store. And now couple that with the call we've made to provide an upgrade offer. We're creating great opportunity for every developer to write these universal windows application that will run on the desktop as well as on our phone and tablets, as well as on Surface Hub and in fact Hollow Lands runs universal applications.` No one else provides that kind of a unified market place for developers and especially the changes we've made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are in fact very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop. So that's the combination of things that we think are going to play out effectively and of course we're in beta right now or previews right now and getting daily feedback across the length and breadth of Windows 10, but overall I am very optimistic of what it means, both as a platform as well as a set of end user features.\nChris Suh: Thanks Rick. Operator, we'll take the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks guys. Just got a question on the commercial other line, obviously that continues to show strong growth and have been climbing up in the cloud business whether it be Azure, Office 365, but I just wanted to double click on the Azure side. Wondering if you could help us parse through sort of the infrastructure server as in the platform as server side and the trends there and any sort of joint benefit I guess that you're seeing and being able to offer both as to and also such as this business does scale and then Amy. I would love you to chime in hereto, how do you think about the gross margin and just operating margin characteristics once again as the revenue just continues to grow here?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Phil. So let me start. Overall, what we're seeing is, clearly there is increased usage of infrastructure as a service because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud. But the interesting thing that happens once you move your initial workload is you build around it. Especially for example, if you move a VM with some data into the cloud, you may want to use the same data to build a mobile front end and that\u2019s when you're starting to use some of our platform as a service components like our Azure Mobile Services, Azure Media Services. So we see the combination and they're not all happening coincident, but there is time lag in it but therefore that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads on to Azure both storage and compute; and even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM sizes and then on top of that, we have these managed services which have a different margin profile. So media services, mobile services, WAB which is another place where we actually have lot of traction. And then that\u2019s all just on Azure. Once you get beyond Azure, you have things like CRM Online, you have enterprise mobility suite and of course the Office 365 line up and when we think about our capital and in fact the core infrastructure, we don\u2019t have different infrastructure for these different services. It\u2019s one common infrastructure and one common data center footprint between O365 Azure, CRM, Xbox Live everything. So that\u2019s why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about even total return on invested capital for our cloud business.\nPhil Winslow: Great.\nChris Suh: Thanks Phil. We'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up Amy, your commercial other business continues to have fantastic growth and I am just wondering when you juxtaposed that with the growth in the commercial licensing business, I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you faced. But when we think about it more than one quarter out and think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market share in the cloud, how do we think about the trends in the commercial licensing business in the next year or so?\nAmy Hood: Let me -- I think in general, let me start by saying all -- all up right. So in our commercial business, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud. That is our strategic goal as well as impacts in both segments. Now let me talk about sort of uniquely commercial licensing and how to think about it. While I won\u2019t give specific guidance, I will talk about how to think about the impact in particular from XP. Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP. That doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as customers not continuing to be committed or not committing to move to annuity over the longer term, which is exactly I think the question that you're asking. And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing which will be a headwind, the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on prem because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guide post we have on a multi-year -- on a multi-year journey.\nChris Suh: Thanks Heather. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. Satya, I wanted to follow up on Phil Winslow\u2019s question earlier on the -- on Azure and the used cases there. In theory you have a huge opportunity given your install base on the server side. Can you talk a little bit about what -- what you're seeing the SMB customer base doing. Are we kind of in it? People trying bursting or where is that huge customer base in terms of adoption on Azure?\nSatya Nadella: On Azure itself, one of the other elements that I did not actually talk about in response to Phil\u2019s question is the hybrid offering. One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the store simple product, which is essentially a storage product that cloud Tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud. We also have built now into windows server backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL server. So that's the first thing that we're seeing is increased usage of our servers with the cloud component. Bursting is something for sure a lot of people do but that\u2019s more on the high end because in the SMB segment, the real movement there is more to Office 365. In fact, one of the things in Office 365 is we're getting people to effectively use servers, which now happens to be in cloud who never bought servers from us ever before because they didn\u2019t have exchange, they didn\u2019t have link, they didn\u2019t have any of the core capabilities of Office 365. So those are the two trends we're seeing.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, and a quick follow-up for Amy, if you look at the changes on the operating side that you talked about, it obviously seems to -- as a cultural shift. What\u2019s more, if you budget, it\u2019s more dynamic budgeting it's very much a return base culture that you seem to be introducing here. But it\u2019s something that kind of needs to be feed through the organization and it\u2019s more a cultural change. Where are you in terms of like innings in terms of having it fully through the organization?\nAmy Hood: Thanks for that question. I think we've talked about this in prior quarters while I think many people want to see it as a finance concept, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a senior leadership team concept and the leadership environment that I think we're making collective decisions faster. I think we are applying our resources to opportunities when we see them. I think we have a freedom to make those choices quickly and I feel very good those about the decisiveness that comes with it, but also the empowerment that we give to people within our organizations to make those calls, to increase our performance without waiting to an annual budget process. I think some people call it dynamic budgeting. I think for us, I think it\u2019s more about -- thinking about opportunities we have and stack ranking those every day to improve both our execution and our returns.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks. We'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.\nBrendan Barnicle: Thanks so much. Amy, when we first started talking about Office 365, I think at that time, you were suggesting that the move from an Office CAL to an Office 365 license would increase gross profit by about 50%. Now that you had a couple of quarters with Office 365, do you think those changes to the model still make sense and more importantly, are there may be other changes that you're seeing that are more accurate?\nAmy Hood: Thanks for the question. In general, I think we're still on the early ends of seeing the opportunity that we have in that segment. As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life cycle. The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own. So as you move Office, it\u2019s simply the first step. So, even though obviously it comes at a little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up. And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we\u2019ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time. We mentioned simply one that didn\u2019t exist I think Brendan when we first started having this conversation, which was our EMS suite and I look and say, those opportunities as well as the creativity of our people I think gives me more confidence if not less in the structural integrity of the lifetime value of a customer argument.\nBrendan Barnicle: Great. Thank you so much.\nChris Suh: Thanks. Operator, we will have time for one last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.\nEd Maguire: Yes. Thank you. Over the last several quarters and particularly Satya, you\u2019ve opened up a number of the products to different platforms, Office in Android and with Minecraft and Skype, you've got a number of really multiplatform products and services. Could you quantify so far to what extent you\u2019ve seen benefit and as this plays into the free upgrade for Windows 10 at least for a limited period, how you expect this to play out benefitting the business case of your products across the portfolio?\nSatya Nadella: Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace. So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services. So that\u2019s the core rational for why we are doing cross platform. Now the next question is what\u2019s the uniqueness of Windows? And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don\u2019t think of these services and their application end points as apps, but fundamentally core to the Windows experience. So we are building them natively into windows. So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure ID. When you have files, they are synching with one drive. Outlook is the email client for Windows. So that\u2019s how Windows will differentiate and not to mention, our Gaming and Xbox Live experiences. So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in windows and at the same time, we will make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage, more subscription growth. So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth and EMS growth.\nEd Maguire: Great. Thank you.\nChris Suh: Great. Thanks.

Three month ago I outlined how Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world. Since then we have galvanized around this direction and are executing well. I am proud of the results we\u2019ve delivered this quarter across all businesses. Results are up in every category from commercial to consumer to hardware. With $23.2 billion in revenue for this quarter, we\u2019re off to a great start to the year. More importantly we\u2019re also pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in evolving our culture to be fast, innovative partner-friendly and customer obsessed. As I reflect on this past quarter, there are four important indicators of progress that I want to highlight: cloud, Windows, hardware and finally I\u2019ll talk about our ecosystem momentum. First, our cloud offering continue to grow at a rapid rate. More people in organizations are signing up and we are generating more revenue across both commercial and consumer customers. Our commercial cloud revenue grew a 128% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In fact we\u2019re the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple-digit rates. An 80% of the Fortune 500 are now on the Microsoft Cloud. Office 365 commercial seats nearly doubled, two out of every three new customers see our premium versions. Consumer Office 365 now exceeds 7 million subscribers, up more than 25% for the last quarter alone. We continue to invest in growing our leadership position in areas with great opportunity. To that end, we\u2019re expanding our data center capacity to meet demand, provide the best customer experience, enable data solvency and deliver continuous innovation. As you are seeing robust growth because of our unique approach as the only hyper scale public cloud provider with enterprise great capabilities and true private cloud and hybrid cloud offerings. We continue to add new features and capabilities faster than ever based on user feedback cycles. One major Azure service of feature is released every three days on average, opening up many more new user scenarios for our customers. Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning and fast analytics and enterprise mobility. More than 60% of the Azure customers are now using at least each one of these premium services such as Enterprise Mobility Suite, which is off to a very fast start. Top 10 [IVs] love our open and flexible approach and are building on Azure at a rapid pace. In fact 40% of Azure revenue now comes from startup NISD. Even with our tremendous growth in public cloud, we are still seeing strength in our on-premise businesses with double-digit growth across Windows Servers, SQL Server, System Center and Dynamics. This is because of the unique hybrid and private cloud capabilities that are built into our service. The second indicator of progress is the improvement in the overall health of the Windows ecosystem in the first quarter. We introduced and expanded set of Windows offering which helped drive consumer unit growth in quarter one and will provide incremental opportunities for use of Microsoft services such as Bing. With these new offerings, OEMs are delivering exciting new devices at extremely attractive price points, including Windows PCs at 199 and below. In September, we took the first steps in publicly sharing more about the next generation of Windows. Windows 10 will unlock new experiences for customers to work, play and connect across an incredibly broad set of devices with screens from 4 inches to 80 inches and even IOT devices. Windows 10 will deliver a single unified application development platform, one way to write a universal app across the entire family of Windows devices and one store with the unified way for applications to be discovered, purchased and updated across all these devices. Think about it, with Windows 10 developers can build one app and thus expand billions of devices. When I talk about putting customers at the center of everything we do, it\u2019s especially true for Windows with incorporating customer feedback earlier than ever in the development cycle especially with our enterprise customers. This will be the best Windows release ever for businesses. And with hundreds of thousands of pieces of feedback flowing into the team already, Windows 10 will be the most collaborative version of Windows we have ever shipped. Third, I want to highlight some specific markers of advancements in hardware and gaming. Across the entire hardware portfolio, I\u2019m encouraged by the reception from customers and our continuously improving execution. Surface had strong results this quarter driven by positive customer response to Surface Pro 3. The product line up is the right one and customers are responding favorably. Surface Pro 3 is now in 28 markets and importantly we have improved the business economics of this product line. With phone, we have move quickly to integrate the business. We are executing on all of the restructuring changes we talked about in the last quarter while driving Lumia share growth. We saw modest growth over the prior year driven by sales in Europe where we gained share with lower price devices. Now let\u2019s talk gaming. As I previously said, gaming is an important category that will drive additive business value for Microsoft. It is a single biggest digital live category measured in both time and money spent across devices of all type. We launched Xbox One in 28 markets, increased console unit sales from a year ago, and grew users of Xbox LIVE apps by more than 20%. The acquisition of Mojang which we expect to close in November, extends our ecosystem and community across multiple platforms. Minecraft adds to our already strong portfolio of first party games and contents such as Halo and will strengthen our gaming experiences on PCs and consoles as well as cross-platform monetization. The fourth and final area I want to focus on today is the renewed energy and momentum in our partnerships. As a productivity and platforms company, we create vast opportunity for our partners through moving fast to extend our platforms and tools to reach more customers through partnerships; from SAP and Oracle to Salesforce, Adobe and IBM to the latest partnerships we announced this past week with Docker, Cloudera and CoreOS. Great partnerships emerge from great products, strong momentum and the shared enthusiasm about a long-term vision. Technology leaders across the board recognize the customer value inherent in products like Office 365, Azure and Windows. And they want to align their businesses with our healthy and growing ecosystem. You\u2019ll see more partnerships in the months ahead. It\u2019s the best way to deliver the best possible experience for our customers in today\u2019s heterogeneous mobile-first cloud-first world. In summary, I am pleased with the progress we\u2019re making, things all across the company are rallying around our core focus to reinvent productivity and create platform for a mobile-first cloud-first world. We will continue to drive the changes that will position us for the future. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders, and we will be relentless in looking for areas to invest for long-term growth. With that Amy will go through our Q1 results in detail and share our outlook for Q2 and then I\u2019ll join her for Q&A. Thank you very much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks and good afternoon everyone. As Satya said, we had a very strong start to the fiscal year. We made meaningful progress with improved execution across all our businesses. I am encouraged by what we have achieved and believe we\u2019re well positioned for the future. With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our first quarter. Revenue was $23.2 billion, up 25% over last year and up 11% excluding phone. Earnings per share were $0.54 which included an $0.11 negative impact from integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that impact, EPS grew 5% to $0.65, even after considering the impact of the phone business on profits. We\u2019re accelerating the pace of decision-making and taking decisive actions to improve how we operate. This approach is reflected in the progress we\u2019ve made in restructuring the company and integrating our phone business. As a result, we incurred charges of $1.1 billion this quarter. Geographically, we saw a strong performance across the U.S. and Europe and consistent with Q4, a more challenging environment in China and Russia. Let me now discuss our results in greater detail. Our commercial business had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 10% and unearned revenue grew 12%. Renewal rates were higher than what we\u2019ve seen in the recent first quarters. And in Office, one-third of renewals included Office 365. Importantly, we are seeing a mixed shift from on-prem to the cloud, from transactional purchasing to annuity and from standard to premium versions. Our commercial cloud services continued their exceptional trajectory with another quarter of triple-digit growth. We\u2019re investing in higher level services and new scenarios in Azure enabled by the scale, cost and flexibility of the cloud. And these services are expanding our addressable market. We\u2019re adding new users and importantly growing revenue from existing on-prem customers who have adopted Azure services. Our on-prem data platform infrastructure product continue to have strong momentum with an ongoing shift to premium version. Revenue from premium skews was up 25% this quarter. Office 365 had another terrific quarter and remains on path to becoming the unparalleled leader for cloud-based productivity apps. CIOs are selecting Office 365 as the center piece of their hybrid productivity solutions as they look to meet the growing mobile needs of their employees. SMBs are also realizing the benefits of Office 365 and as a result are moving from transactional purchasing to subscription. And as Satya mentioned, we\u2019re seeing good partnership momentum as other companies look to integrate other 365 into their products. Turning to Windows. Windows OEM Pro revenue performed in line with the business PC market and volumes were more consistent with those seen before the XP Refresh in fiscal \u201814. Windows volume licensing grew 10% as business customers continued to value the platform security and manageability. During the quarter, we took important steps to grow Windows usage and improve the health of the ecosystem. Both our existing and new OEM partners are bringing to market an expanded set of device offerings at more competitive price points. Channel inventories are higher than they were last year reflecting confidence from our OEM partners heading into the holiday quarter. IP licensing revenue declined this quarter as our license fees fill the higher mix of low-cost devices was generated lower per unit royalty. Consumer Office revenue inclusive of our subscription offerings grew 7% this quarter. Within this, we saw an accelerated transition to Office 365 Home and Personal and contributed to a decline traditional Office license revenue. Overall, it\u2019s important to note that we continued to grow attach to consumer devices. In Bing, revenue was driven by both volume and rate growth, began deliver double-digit monetization gains driven by investments in both relevance and ranking algorithm. These improvements keep us on the path to Bing profitability in fiscal \u201816. And consistent with prior quarters, display revenue remains under pressure. We are excited by Surface Pro 3 performance as unit sales are pacing at twice the rate of what we saw with Pro 2. We\u2019re seeing strong interest from students, professionals and increasingly enterprises who are replacing their laptops and tablets with Surface Pro 3 for their productivity needs. Gross margin for Surface was positive this quarter. Within gaming, our results reflect a growing console market, our improved competitive position with the new Xbox One SKU and the launch of Xbox One into new geos including the initial channel sales with the launch in China at the end of Q1. As we head into the holiday season, we\u2019re looking forward to the differentiated content that will be available on the Xbox platform including Sunset Overdrive which launches in late October and Halo: The Master Chief Collection which launches in early November. In Phone Hardware, the focus of the quarter was on positioning the business for the future. And we remain committed to reaching breakeven in fiscal \u201815. As part of our restructuring efforts, we started vitalizing our manufacturing capacity, create one development team to accelerate the pace of innovation and focus our sales and marketing efforts on Lumia, which grew in several key markets. Sales of non-Lumia phones were down driven by declines in the underlying feature phone market, as well as portfolio rationalization as we execute on our phone strategy. Gross margin this quarter included the benefit of non-recurring items resulting from our business integration efforts. Operating expenses were favorable to our expectations as we chose to redeploy spend to projects occurring later this fiscal year. These decisions reflect our disciplined assessment as we prioritize where to best allocate our resources. Importantly, we continue to invest in developer and customer safety world to capture the opportunities in key group categories such as the cloud, Big Data and the (inaudible). Our effective tax rate was 23% this quarter influenced by the changing mix of our business, as well as NDS operating losses and restructuring charges, some of which are not tax deductable. This quarter we had $1.3 billion off of capital expenditure. We continue to expand the capacity and locations of our data centers to deliver higher service levels, reduce latency and help meet local data compliance requirements for our global customers. Importantly, even while making these investments, we continue to shift to grow the gross margin of our cloud business. This quarter we increased our capital return by 19% with $4.6 billion return to shareholders through buyback and dividend. As we said in September, the Board and management continue to assess our broader capital allocation strategy as they focus on increasing long-term shareholder value. With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the second quarter, starting with foreign exchange. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as movements were relatively late in the quarter. The following guidance is based on current FX rates, and should the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen, it will create headwinds in our foreign transactional business. The impact of FX on our annuity business was first to be reflected in deferred revenue as it is based on rates when the contract is build and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized. Now moving on to guidance, starting with devices and consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion. Remember, in Q2 of last year we recognized about $650 million of revenue from our commercial agreement with Nokia which has ended. While revenue recognition for the agreement was heavily weighted to Q2 based on contract terms, COGS recognized ratably over the course of the year. Consistent with the current quarter, IP licensing revenue will reflect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices sold by our licensees. With the addition of Office 365 consumer services in Japan, the transition from traditional licensing to a subscription service will negatively impact revenue by approximately $100 million in Q2. We expect the ongoing business PC refresh cycle to continue. Their comparables are challenging as we began to see the benefit of XP end of support in Q2 of last year. We expect that the consumer PC market will remain stable with many of the same dynamics we saw on Q1. In computing and gaming, we expect revenue to be $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. This range reflects growth in Xbox One consoles over the last year, but a mix shift to lower price SKUs announced last June. With the momentum we are seeing with Surface Pro 3, we expect units to grow sequentially. In phone hardware, we expect revenue to be $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. This range anticipates both year-over-year and sequential growth in Lumia units driven by the 500 and 600 series devices. As a result of the ongoing market dynamics and our portfolio rationalization, we expect those volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to decline in Q2. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, which includes growth from Office 365, the launch of Halo, Master Chief Collection and continued monetization gains in [games]. In commercial licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.8 billion to $11 billion, which includes a slight drag from prior year\u2019s estimated XP impact. With the accelerated shift to our cloud services, we expect commercial other revenue to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Overall, we expect our fundamental strength in our commercial business to continue. And in corporate, we expect about $300 million of positive revenue impact next quarter as we recognize prior period deferrals related to bundle offerings. We expect COGS to be $9.5 billion to $9.9 billion with variability driven by both hardware segments. We expect second quarter OpEx to be between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. As I mentioned earlier, our Q1 favorability was primarily driven by the timing and our continued prioritization of activities. Therefore, we still expect full year operating expenses to be $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion. And we remain committed to investing and prioritizing growth areas where we have customer momentum. Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to incur an additional $500 million of expense related to our restructuring efforts. This results in total charges of roughly $1.6 billion, the high end of the range we provided in July. Separately, we are reducing our anticipated integration expenses down to a $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22% including the impact of integration and restructuring. In Q2, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business. As you know, we typically see a decline from Q1 to Q2 on our unearned revenue balance. This Q2, we anticipate a slightly higher sequential decline in our non-commercial segments. This is primarily due to the $300 million impact from revenue recognition in corporate that I referenced earlier. We expect commercial unearned to be in line with historical trends with some of the benefit of our business model transition to annuity, offset by FX rate impact. In closing, this was another quarter of continued growth and disciplined execution. Across the company, we\u2019re making thoughtful data driven decisions to continually assess and prioritize our resources. We\u2019re also investing to accelerate momentum in key strategic areas and to capitalize on emerging trends. We are making great progress in reshaping our company. And I\u2019m encouraged by the opportunities to continue to create long-term shareholder value. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. With that, we\u2019ll move to our Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Certainly. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Good afternoon. On the commercial revenue it continues to grow at an impressive double-digit rate. Many of your peers have not been doing quite as well as you have just in the last reported quarter. Amy I know you mentioned you\u2019re confident about this business continuing. I am curious if you could just maybe underscore what you feel you guys are doing differently than what\u2019s happening in the peer group in underscoring that confidence going forward?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start. Overall what we see is the increasing competitiveness of our products. And I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s reflected in our results. The cloud story I think is fairly clear at this point. The combination of Office 365, as well as Dynamics CRM in particular combined with Azure are driving our cloud growth. As it turns out the technology that we build for our cloud is what we incorporate in our server products, in fact our R&D expense is the same expense. And that\u2019s made our server products very competitive. And so again those our traditional competitors we\u2019re seeing significant share gains across the entire infrastructure line of our server products in particular. And we hope to architected our cloud very differently. We are the only hyper scale cloud provider that also thinks of our server product at the edge of our cloud. So, some of the hybrid capabilities of ourselves have increasing attach and that\u2019s also leading to our overall competitiveness, as well as monetization and margin. And so those are the trends we see in our numbers. We live in the same macro environment as the rest. But right now we\u2019re confident about our competitiveness driving our results.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks Brent. We\u2019ll take next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions on relating to cloud. Amy, can you give us a sense of what the revenue run rate for the commercial cloud was this quarter? And Satya, could you give us a little more on used cases for Azure. Is it more test-and-dev or are you seeing most of it being on the production side? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Mark. As you know, we gave our run rate at the end of last quarter at $4.4 billion and the course we\u2019ve said in our numbers have us on that continued trajectory as we hedge for Q1. So, I think the pace and our accomplishment to share gains remain on a good trend line.\nSatya Nadella: And as far as the used cases, right now it\u2019s actually pretty diversified. We talked pretty extensively about the customer case studies at our cloud event last week. And it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure. There are businesses like for example NVC that are reinventing their business models on top of Azure. We have customers using us for true hybrid, if you were deploying for example a SQL server, you can have high availability using Azure that\u2019s a pretty common deployment now using Azure as the backplane for disaster recovery and high availability, that\u2019s for sure is a workload. But at this point I would say, we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building SaaS applications on top of Azure driving a significant amount of growth of new businesses, the new business models emerging on Azure, as well as hybrid, which I would say are driving. One of the other categories that I see lot of lately is IOT. And the way we participate just on the Azure side, we obviously participate even with our Windows Embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics that\u2019s been one of the place where we are well suited for some of the emerging use cases.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Mark. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys and very nice quarter. First, a question for Amy. Given these nice gross margin improvements across the board, but did some one-time items. So, I was hoping you could help us understand where you\u2019re seeing sort of underlying gross margin improvements, particularly if we look at sort of any improvements that you saw in the phone gross margins as well as the big improvement we saw in the cloud gross margins, how much of that should we look at as durable on a going forward basis?\nAmy Hood: Thanks Keith. Let me start with the cloud and then I\u2019ll move to your phone question. Overall in the commercial business, I think we continue to see gross margin improvement and that is sustainable improvement as opposed to I think what you characterized as some non-recurring things that I have mentioned. It continues to be improvements in scale, improvements in our infrastructure, improvements in utilization, really strong work across all of our engineering teams here. And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business, you see the gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we\u2019re all quite proud of. Onto the phone business where I did call out non-recurring items due to the business integration expense. I don\u2019t -- easier way frankly to think about that Keith is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin. Q4 was a little depressed is how as we think about it due to some of the restructuring; Q1 is a little bit higher. A more blended rate of those two is probably a better way to think about a go-forward margin. Although when you\u2019re transitioning any business and all the hard work that we\u2019re doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that number.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much.\nSatya Nadella: Just to add one thing that I\u2019d say is sort of -- to Mark\u2019s question, which is in particular on Azure, we have some commodity workloads but we also have many differentiated higher margin workloads especially in the Enterprise Mobility Suite is what I\u2019d call out is a good example of an infrastructure workload completely in the cloud that has got a very different margin structure. And those are the things that really give us the ability to have good margin structure for our cloud efforts.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much guys.\nChris Suh: Thank you Keith. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks guys. And congrats on another great quarter. I had a question on Office 365. Obviously, you all continue to see great growth both on the commercial and on the home and personal side. But we also saw Office commercial products and services continue to grow 5%. So one question for Satya and one for Amy. Satya, how do you feel right now about this momentum, particularly on the commercial side that you\u2019re seeing in Office 365 and sort of how you\u2019re targeting larger enterprises versus SMBs? Then Amy, obviously you\u2019ve talked about some cannibalization of end period revenue from the Xbox, 365, where you could help us kind of frame that 5% this quarter on the product and services and how we should think longer term about the revenue and the profitability there? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: I\u2019ll start and then Amy I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Specifically on Office 365, the overall product depth and breadth is continuously improving. One of the great benefits of Office 365 that our customers get to enjoy is that as we innovate and launch new features they get to use them as soon as we have got them deployed on our cloud. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving both the competitiveness, as well as usage of Office 365 and quite honestly the full consumption of what we build and which I think in the long run is super important to us and our customers. But it also turns out some of the server products we have as we see increasing adoption of the cloud, we still have as I said very competitive server products, I mentioned a lot of our infrastructure server products, but take something like Lync. It\u2019s a fantastic product, it is again gaining share in the marketplace, it\u2019s getting deployed in on-premise solutions. So, it\u2019s the combination that\u2019s driving our growth. The other dimension we\u2019re seeing is Office 365 is cross-platform cloud service. We see now coverage across all devices and that leads to customers still using the service even more. So that combination of effects, competitive server products, very competitive cloud service with new features being added all the time, as well as cross-platform is what\u2019s driving our growth.\nAmy Hood: And let me try to take the second part of that question, Phil, which is really through the dynamics of the transactional business to move to the cloud and how I think about bridging those numbers. Our Office transactional business was down this quarter and the difference as you said because of the 5% growth is clearly the growth in Office 365 all up. We go to a place I think always I\u2019d like to point two in terms of triangulating when I look at the health of the overall transition is renewal rates, our renewal rates are amongst the highest we\u2019ve had in the Q1, both our ability to recapture both the contract, as well as the revenue and the value and add services is higher than it has been. In addition, we\u2019re seeing premium units added more frequently in the cloud than we have on-prem. And those types of mixes, you will see both bookings number, as well as in the unearned balance growth. And so, while the exact dollars in any given quarter maybe difficult I guess to triangulate on the components. I always look to see help, I\u2019ve outlined there specifically in the Office business.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks guys.\nChris Suh: Thanks Phil. We\u2019ll go to the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Sherlund: Yes, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on Phil\u2019s question. I think that Office transition, our analysis suggest that\u2019s a net benefit from here for you, I\u2019d like Satya some thoughts maybe about the transition for the rest of the business, if you\u2019ve got server and tools at some point, I mean it continues to show really terrific growth at some point, I suppose that becomes cannibalize by your cloud business with Azure. Maybe Satya, if you can share how you think that transition, how long, how does it transpire or any thoughts on you shouldn\u2019t be net additive to the revenues and operating income as we\u2019ve seen on the Office side? Maybe if you could talk on Windows as well, it looks like OEM down a little bit this quarter, which is big than growing or we cannot see a lower ASPs with these $200 devices coming out this fall.\nSatya Nadella: Let me talk a little bit about the dynamics we\u2019re seeing in particular with our infrastructure servers, as well as Azure because it is actually pretty unique, I think to at least our product offering. As I said, our servers have become much more competitive because of the same technology investments that we\u2019re making in our cloud. And the used cases that we see in the cloud in many cases happen to be net new workloads, IOT was not driving our server growth traditionally, mobile backend was not driving our servers traditionally. So, a machine learning and advanced analytics of areas we did not participate even in the past. So, one of the things that we have seen is a lot of new used cases of Azure, which were really new Greenfield territory for us. And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much broader than just even the hyper scale public cloud because the one thing that is true is there are more devices in that unit backend. And that backend in many cases in regulator industries with the GEO participation we have is needed everywhere. So one of the things that we are in fact very focused on is enabling others to build their own clouds. So, our private cloud, premium cue mix is also growing you see that in our results. So, at least in the intermediate timeframe, we do not see cannibalization. We see more impact of this hybrid, private, as well as public cloud all being complementary. And of course being used together delivered more value to customers and that\u2019s where our competitive advantage comes. On the Windows side just to finish off. We wanted to make sure that we have competitive Windows ecosystem participation across all the price points. So we made some deliberate changes to our business model and that is in fact playing out in the marketplace where we now have very competitive full Windows PCs less than $199 going into this holiday season. And that in fact in Q1 caused the market to expand. That was really by design and so we are happy to see that. And so on a blended basis, of course the ASPs will be different because of the two ranges. So, but overall that\u2019s what our goal is. We want to be able to make sure that we compete on all price points and overall grow the volume.\nRick Sherlund: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks. We\u2019ll go to next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Satya, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about, you\u2019re seeing some progress on the cloud gross margins and you\u2019re also investing pretty heavily. And I\u2019m wondering how important it is for you kind of medium to long-term to be able to get things like Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365 running on the same infrastructure as Azure in terms of getting the kind of sale you want and ultimately driving the margins to where you want it to get to; is that sort of a prerequisite to get to where you\u2019d like those margins to be?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I mean it\u2019s absolute perquisite for us to have entirety of our cloud infrastructure plant drive scale economics for us. And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data center management comes out of our bring efforts. We manage all of the supply chain, all of it is as one supply chain; we do SKU design as one SKU design; we drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether. In fact you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. And you look at even some of our games like Halo, a significant usage of our cloud. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving some of the economics. In fact the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don\u2019t have just one first party workload because it\u2019s very easy for one first party workload to completely opt if you will the architecture of a cloud. But in our case, we have a very diverse set of workload. We have Xbox LIVE; we have Office 365; we have Dynamics and Bing and that diversity is what allows us to build in fact for our own needs a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads and that\u2019s working pretty well for us.\nWalter Pritchard: Got it. Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks very much. We\u2019ll take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you so much. Satya, I was wondering if you could share with us given the amazing XP refresh we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months, as you\u2019re talking to customers, how do you feel about the corporate PC refresh cycle in calendar \u201815?\nSatya Nadella: I think it will come back to the pre-XP business PC refresh. And so that\u2019s what I think Amy\u2019s comments also reflected and that\u2019s what we expect to have happen in the rest of this fiscal year. The thing that Heather we are focused on is how do we make sure that not only do we -- the incremental value that we have today on Windows 8 gets adopted; there are in fact lots of use cases especially around field devices, mobile workforce where we are in fact seeing great adoption of Windows 8. But Windows 10 is something that\u2019s completely optimized for the enterprise and across all same sizes for the mobile worker, as well as the desktop and large screens. Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it\u2019s the mobility of the individual not the one device. That is important in the enterprise and that\u2019s what we are building towards with great management and great security. And so we\u2019re pleased with the early feedback we are getting from the first disclosure of Windows 10 and as well as some of the successes we are having with Windows 8 adoption in the enterprise. But the adoption I think will get back to a normal PC Refresh in the enterprise.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Heather.\nChris Suh: We\u2019ll go to next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Ives: Yes, thanks. Satya, what do you think as you move to the cloud and really try to go into this next phase of growth. Is it biggest challenge and then maybe the biggest opportunity from just a high level as we think about Microsoft going into the next stage?\nSatya Nadella: I mean that\u2019s the biggest opportunity is to be able to get into space. I mean one of the things that I always think about it, for all the success we\u2019ve had in our server business, we were a low share player. And when I look at the total IT spend of that enterprise customers have today. As I said, we\u2019ve not participated in many, many areas, we got even the data set. We have a very good business in SQL Server, we have perhaps the most competitive SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is growing nicely. But if you look at what is secular in terms of growth going forward, it\u2019s data, data management in a variety of new ways. So, those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud, as well as with our server products. The challenge will always remain at the end of the day for us to make sure that we are bringing together unique offers. One of the things that I want to ask team to be very focused on is to bring uniqueness that only Microsoft can bring it to the marketplace. That\u2019s why it is approach around platform and reinvention of productivity, I believe is what we can do that for sure we\u2019re going to have incredible competition. But at the same time, I think that if you ask anyone, at least in our campus whether we deeply get what it means to reinvent productivity I believe do we get deeply how to take the various constituents from end users IT and developers and harmonize their interest in unique ways so that enterprises can adopt solutions, we get that deeply. So, to me staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps are both on opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side.\nDaniel Ives: Great job on the quarter especially relative to your tech peers. Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Dan. We\u2019ll move to next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Satya, I just wanted to get your perspective on the business mix. Still you have a very strong and growing consumer footprint especially with Nokia and then you\u2019ve got a very solid enterprise backbone. And I feels like the consumer side of the house is pulling away much faster and obviously you\u2019ve got some implications for how you look at the business in terms of margins and how they did potentially inflect subscriptions. If you can just give us your thoughts Satya on how you see that business mix that will be great? And also wondering, Amy, if you could shed some light on cost controls what further things that specifically the company engage in the sales and marketing expense came in at a nice surprise much lower than we expected? Thank you very much.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks. The way I see the market when we sort of talk about productivity and platforms, we really don\u2019t make this big distinction between consumer and enterprise and when it takes productivity out, we\u2019re very focused on dual use. In fact one of the pieces of data that Amy and I shared was the growth in the consumer subscriptions of Office 365 even sequentially grew by significant percentage. So therefore, we\u2019re seeing good adoption of our productivity services, specifically in the context of this dual use where people want to use it at home and people want to use it at work. And that\u2019s where in fact a lot of our R&D investment is to make that very seamless. So, to me that\u2019s how we want to drive and gaming is the one category we have said that we will invest in it for its own sake in driving enterprise value out of our gaming. There are in fact lots of benefits which come because of technology. In fact the reason why we are so competitive now in Cortana and speech recognition which I think is core to productivity is it first started with Connect and Xbox. So, we\u2019ll always have those kind of incidental benefits, but really in gaming we want to have our body gaming, Xbox LIVE console and as well as PC gaming thrive and drive more incremental value for us and Minecraft obviously helps in that context. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ll view the future for how we think about our businesses.\nAmy Hood: And on the overall operating expense and how we\u2019ve managed that. In general, I don\u2019t think about it as control using that types of the word. I think what is perhaps most impressive is that we have managed to continue throughout the quarter whether it\u2019s week-to-week or month-to-month to looking at where is the highest ROI we get from our spend, how can we drive our business forward, both in period but also for the future, it\u2019s just as important for us to balance that. And I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of picking those places and really investing intentionally and aggressively behind places where we know we\u2019re differentiated.\nUnidentified Analyst: Wonderful. Thank you very much, happy Halloween.\nChris Suh: Thanks [Scott]. Operator, we\u2019ll have time for one more question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Hi, thanks. Question for Amy, Amy just thinking through your guide by business segment, everything seems roughly in line for the D&C licensing guide which implies I think a 24% year-over-year decline. And given that that\u2019s a 19% gross margin business, I just want to make sure I understand what\u2019s happening there. And I have two questions. I am wondering if you could help disaggregate how much of that is due to the tough XP related compare versus some other perhaps one-time issues that make for a tough comparison. And then secondly, when in your best judgment do you think that D&C licensing revenue might turn positive? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Great. Karl, thanks for asking that question; it gives me a chance to reiterate how many of those components are bit one-time in nature. The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement that\u2019s about $650 million that we earned in Q2 of a year ago that because of the ended the agreement simply goes away. So, I\u2019ll start with that point. The second component relates to the same trend we saw in our IP business that we saw in Q4 then in Q1, we\u2019re doing and seeing again in Q2. So, I would also see that exact same trend line and assessment. The next component which is a change is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 consumer services in Japan, which is a Geo that we had not been in historically. That does result in a revenue to fall, it will end up in unearned. But that\u2019s about $100 million impact that we would not have seen before that. And so, by the time you move all of that out of the comparison group, you really get back to very similar trends in our D&C licensing business that we saw this quarter for what I think was a component to you are focused on which is OEM Pro and OEM non-Pro, which we expect to really resemble the results we saw this quarter and marry -- and to matched up PC business dynamics overall.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could sneak in one more, Amy, the 2.9 billion share repurchase, it feels like an uptick compared to what you\u2019ve done every quarter for the last couple of years. Is this sort of a new level that we can expect from Microsoft maybe just a thought on the pace of the share buyback?\nAmy Hood: Thanks for the question. I did -- we are proud of the increase in shareholder return this quarter and importantly we\u2019re focused on how we can continue to do that as a part of our overall long-term shareholder growth.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay.\nChris Suh: Great. Thanks Karl and thank you Amy. With that wrapped up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Please note that our second quarter earnings call will be held on Monday January 26, 2015. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast and you can follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact just if you need any additional detail. And thank you again for joining us.\nAmy Hood: Thanks everyone.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. \nChris Suh: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. \n On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.\n On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \n Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.\n Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which include research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. \n As a reminder, in May, we announced plans to further streamline the Phone Hardware business. During the fourth quarter, restructuring and related impairment expenses were $1.1 billion. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation. \n At the segment level, we provide constant-currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we're not able to provide segment level constant-currency operating expense growth and, consequently, cannot derive constant-currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant-currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level. \n We'll post our prepared remarks on our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19, 2017. \n During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris, and to everyone on the call for joining. I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and partners who contributed to a successful year. We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth. Today, Amy and I will share our fourth quarter results and our perspective on the year ahead. \n We delivered $22.6 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% for the quarter in constant currency. This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation. Our progress is best captured in the results of our 3 ambitions, starting with Productivity and Business Process. In a world of infinite information but finite attention and time, we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology. \n In pursuit of this ambition, we continue to add value to our products, grow usage and increase our addressable market. Along these lines, let me start with Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365. In the last quarter, we advanced our collaboration tools. We launched Microsoft Planner, which helps teams manage operations as well as Skype meetings, which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate. In June, we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management.\n Lastly, we continue to add intelligence and machine learning to Office to help people automate their tasks and glean insights from data. These advancements help to drive increased usage across enterprises, small and medium businesses and consumers. In the enterprise, Office 365 commercial seats grew 45% year-over-year, and revenue grew 59% in constant currency. Also, 70% of our Office Enterprise Agreement renewals are in the cloud. Innovative companies like Facebook, HERSHEY'S, Discovery Communications, Cushman & Wakefield, all adopted Office 365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business. We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released Office 365 E5, which includes powerful security controls, advanced analytics and cloud voice. These customers tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity workloads. \n We see momentum in small and medium businesses, with a growing number of partners selling Office 365, now up to nearly 90,000, a 25% increase year-over-year. We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each month for 28 consecutive months. We also see momentum amongst consumers with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers. Across segments, customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, we now have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than 4x over last year. \n Now let's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition, Dynamics 365. We're removing any impedance that exists within productivity, collaboration and business process. This month, we took a major step forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. Dynamics 365 provides business users with purpose-built SaaS applications. These applications have intelligence built in. They integrate deeply with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365. Dynamics 365, along with AppSource and our rich application platform, introduces a disruptive and customer-centric business model, so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need. \n The launch of Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we're already seeing in this business. Customers around the globe are harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation, including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather. Overall, Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid feeds, up more than 20% year-over-year, and Q4 billings grew more than 20% year-over-year. Overall, business processes represent an enormous addressable market projected to be more than 100 billion by 2020. It's a market we are increasingly focused on, and I believe we are poised with both Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners. \n Across Office 365 and Dynamics 365, developers increasingly see the opportunity to build innovative apps and experiences with the Microsoft Graph, and we now have over 27,000 apps connected to it. Microsoft AppSource will be a new way for developers to offer their services and reach customers worldwide. \n Lastly, with Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we have the opportunity to connect the world's professional cloud and the world's professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal. \n Overall, the Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support. With more than $12 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate, we're on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year '18. Also, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 companies have at least 3 of our cloud offerings, and we continue to grow our annuity mix of our business. In fact, commercial annuity mix increased year-over-year to 83%. \n Now let's get into the specifics of the Intelligent Cloud, an area of massive opportunity as we are clearly one of the 2 enterprise cloud leaders. Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud partner and turned to Microsoft. As a result, Azure revenue and usage again grew by more than 100% this quarter. We see customers choose Microsoft for 3 reasons: they want a cloud provider that offer solutions that reflect the realities of today's world and their enterprise great needs; they want higher-level services to drive digital transformation; and they want a cloud open to developers of all types. \n Let me expand on each. To start, a wide variety of customers turn to Azure because of their specific real-world needs. Multinationals choose us because we are the only hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions. We cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider, from North America to Asia to Europe to Latin America. Our cloud respects data sovereignty and makes it possible for an enterprise application to work across these regions and jurisdictions. \n More than 80% of the world's largest banks are Azure customers because of our leadership support for regulatory requirements, advanced security and commitment to privacy. Large ISVs like SAP and Citrix as well as startups like Sprinklr, also choose Azure because of our global reach and our broad set of platform services. Last week, GE announced it will adopt our cloud for its IoT approach. \n Next, Azure customers also value our unique higher-level services. Now at 33,000, we nearly doubled in 1 year the number of companies worldwide that have selected our Enterprise Mobility solutions. The Dow Chemical Company leverages EMS along with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics to give its thousands of employees secure, real-time access to data and apps from anywhere. Just yesterday, we announced Boeing will use Azure IoT Suite and Cortana Intelligence to drive digital transformation in commercial aviation with connected airline systems optimization, predictive maintenance and much more. This builds on great momentum in IoT, including our work with Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric and others. This is great progress, but our ambitions are set even higher. \n Our Intelligent Cloud also enables cognitive services. Cortana Intelligence Suite offers machine learning capabilities and advanced predictive analytics. Customers like Jabil Circuit, Fruit of the Loom, Land O'Lakes, Liebherr, already realize the benefits of these new capabilities. \n Lastly, central to our Intelligent Cloud ambition is providing developers with the tools and capabilities they need to build apps and services for the platforms and devices of their choice. The new Azure Container Service as well as .NET Core 1.0 for open source and our ongoing work with companies such as Red Hat, Docker, Mesosphere, reflects significant progress on this front. We continue to see traction from open source with nearly 1/3 of customer virtual machines on Azure running Linux. \n On the server side, premium server revenue grew double-digits in constant currency year-over-year. New SQL Server 2016 helps us expand into new markets with built-in advanced analytics and unparalleled performance. More than 15,000 customers, including over 50% of the Fortune 500 have registered for the private preview of SQL Server for Linux. And we're not slowing down. We will launch Windows Server 2016 and Systems Server 2016 later this year.\n Now let's talk about the progress in More Personal Computing. We have increased Windows 10 monthly active devices, and they're now at more than 350 million. This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release. While we are proud of these results, given changes to our Phone plan, we changed how we will assess progress. \n Going forward, we will track progress by regularly reporting the growth of Windows 10 monthly active devices in addition to progress on 3 aspects of our Windows strategy. First, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform. Third, innovating new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me walk through each. \n We continue to pursue our goal of moving people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows. In 2 weeks, we will launch Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which takes a significant step up in security. We are also extending Windows Hello to support apps and websites and delivering a range of new features like Windows Ink and updates to Microsoft Edge. We expect these advances will drive increased adoption of Windows 10, particularly in the enterprise in the coming year. We already have strong traction with over 96% of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10. \n Next, as we grow our installed base and engagement, we generate more opportunity for Microsoft and our ecosystem. Bing profitability continues to grow with greater than 40% of the search revenue in June from Windows 10 devices. Bing PC query share in the United States approached 22% this quarter, not including volume from AOL and Yahoo!. The Cortana search box has over 100 million monthly active users, with 8 billion questions asked to date. \n We continue to drive growth in gaming by connecting fans on Xbox LIVE across Windows 10, iOS and Android. Just this quarter, we launched our Minecraft Realms subscription on Android and iOS. Overall, engagement on Xbox LIVE is at record levels with more than 49 million monthly active users, up 33% year-over-year. At E3, we announced our biggest lineup of exclusive games ever for Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs. And we announced Xbox Play Anywhere titles where gamers can buy a game once and play it on both their Windows 10 PC and Xbox One. We also announced 2 new members of the Xbox One console family, the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio. The Windows store continues to grow with new universal Windows apps like Bank of America, Roku, SiriusXM, Instagram, Facebook, Wine, Hulu and popular PC games like Quantum Break. \n Finally, we are innovating in new device categories in partnership with OEMs. Our hardware partners are embracing the new personal computing vision, with over 1,500 new devices designed to take advantage of Windows 10 innovations like Touch, Pen, Hello and better performance and power efficiency. \n Microsoft's family of Surface devices continues to drive category growth, and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. We recently announced new Surface enterprise initiatives with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton to enable more customer segments. Also in the past year, we grew our commercial Surface partner channel from over 150 to over 10,000. \n Lastly, this quarter, more and more developers and enterprise customers got to experience 2 entirely new device categories from Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. While we are still in the early days of both of these devices, we have seen great traction with both enterprise customers and developers making us optimistic about future growth. \n In closing, I want to reflect on the opportunity ahead of us. Simply put, businesses will not just use digital technologies, but they will become digital companies. This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. We are the ones who can empower digital transformation across all industries, companies and geographies with our technology and platforms. \n With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions. \nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.6 billion, up 2% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat but up 4% in constant currency. Operating income this quarter declined by 3% and grew 6% in constant currency. And earnings per share were $0.69, increasing 11% year-over-year or 27% in constant currency.\n Across most markets, our execution and results were generally as expected, with some strength in the U.S. But we did see additional softness in Brazil, the Middle East and Africa, which were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. From a seasonality perspective, the fourth quarter is always an important one for our commercial business. Our results were strong as our sales teams led with our cloud offers. Healthy renewal helped to drive double-digit annuity performance in constant currency. Our total annuity mix reached 83%, up 1 point year-over-year. While our commercial cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall, we also had better-than-expected transactional revenue performance as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume. \n The dollar volume of expiring enterprise agreements was smaller this quarter than last year. On that base, our commercial bookings increased 4% in constant currency, driven by customer preference for our cloud offers. Commercial unearned revenue slightly beat our expectations at $24.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance exceeded $25.5 billion. \n As Satya called out earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue rate exceeded $12.1 billion, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Additionally, more than 70% of customers who signed Enterprise Agreements this quarter attached cloud offerings. Our commercial cloud gross margin was 42%, declining year-over-year, driven by investments for cloud capacity, deployment and support. \n Now let's turn to company gross margin performance. We were above our COGS expectations due to approximately $200 million of inventory adjustments from the change in our Phone Hardware business. And, as expected, our mix of cloud services revenue continued to increase, resulting in gross margin percentage declines in the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments. Importantly, gross margin dollars expanded year-over-year in constant currency. \n In Q4, the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a 3-point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a 2-point negative impact on More Personal Computing results. As we've noted in previous quarters, we're not able to provide constant-currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and, therefore, segment operating income. This quarter, total operating expenses grew 1% in constant currency, above our expectations due to legal settlements and revenue-driven sales cost. At the company level, our operating income grew 6% in constant currency as FX had a 9-point impact on our results. \n Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with nearly $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 5% and 8% in constant currency. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 9% in constant currency as Office 365 growth outpaced the shift from our on-premises business. Our seat growth was driven by broad-based momentum across commercial customers of all sizes. While we generally expect transactional purchasing to continue to decline, results across all products came in higher-than-anticipated this quarter. \n Office consumer revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, outperforming the consumer PC market, driven by seat growth, recurring subscription revenue and 6 points of growth from Japan, which had a particularly weak quarter a year ago. And our Dynamics business grew 6%, up 7% in constant currency with strong billings and seat growth. Segment gross margin dollars were flat and up 4% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud revenue mix within the segment, coupled with an increase in cloud investments. Operating expenses grew 6% from investments in commercial cloud sales programs and engineering. As a result, operating income declined 5%. \n The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered slightly more than $6.7 billion in revenue, growing 7% and 10% in constant currency. Demand and use of our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on-premises server business. \n Enterprise services revenue grew 12%, 14% in constant currency, as customer demand for Windows Server 2003 and the support agreement and premier services continued this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 1% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentages declined as cloud mix accelerated. This quarter, operating income declined 17%, driven by investment in sales resources and engineering. \n Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $8.9 billion, down 4% and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business grew 11% this quarter outperforming the overall PC market, which was better than we expected in most markets, including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by incremental weakness in India and Russia. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 27% and, similar to last quarter, was driven by a higher mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue grew 2%, reflecting a stabilizing commercial PC market and a higher mix of business PCs sold with Windows Pro. \n Inventory, across both OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels. Windows volume licensing grew 3% and 9% in constant currency with ongoing annuity growth. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and lower revenue per unit. \n We continued to execute well in our search business this quarter. And as we committed, Bing was profitable for the full fiscal year, driven by increasing revenue per search and search volume. As expected, devices revenue significantly decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 35%, also 35% in constant currency, due to Phone, where revenue declined 70% in constant currency. Surface revenue increased 9% in constant currency as Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book growth was partially offset by unit declines in our prior-generation Surface 3. \n And in gaming, revenue declined 9% or 8% in constant currency, driven by lower Xbox 360 unit volume and reduced Xbox One pricing. Our overall gaming ecosystem showed healthy growth with 49 million monthly active Xbox LIVE users or a 33% increase and 4% Xbox LIVE revenue growth. Segment gross margin dollars declined 3%, or roughly flat in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and the Phone inventory adjustment were partially offset by our OEM and search results. Operating expenses decreased this quarter by 13% based primarily on reduced Phone spend and the transition of display advertising sales to AOL, resulting in segment operating income growth of 59%. \n Now back to our overall company results. We invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures, consistent with our plan for accelerated investment as we added both commercial and consumer global cloud capacity to meet near-term and longer-term customer demand. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $267 million from net recognized gains on investments, partially offset by interest expense. \n Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15% this quarter, lower than we expected. Our income tax expense reflected a favorable mix between U.S. and foreign currencies, as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign affiliates. \n This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. \n Before turning to next quarter's outlook, I want to share our view on the shape of next fiscal year. My commentary, both on the year and next quarter, does not include LinkedIn. However, we still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. \n For the full year, we expect the FX impact to lessen throughout the year, assuming current rates remain stable. In H1, we expect the total impact of 1 point, reducing to 0 in H2. The fundamentals of our commercial business remain strong, and we anticipate that cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive high annuity mix. As I've noted before, our Commercial transactional business is influenced by different dynamics. Most important, it's impacted by a structural transition to the cloud across all workloads, but it's also more sensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions and changes in corporate budgets. We expect volatility as we saw in both Q3 and Q4 this year to continue in the next fiscal year. \n Before discussing our total company gross margin expectations, let me first address commercial cloud gross margin. We expect the commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars to materially improve next fiscal year. We have invested heavily to build share, expand geographically and ensure world-class support and reliability for our commercial customers. Going forward, we expect those investments to provide benefits of scale. We also anticipate our cloud capital expenditure growth curve will slow. Given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will see variability quarter-to-quarter but an overall trend of material improvement. \n At the company level, at each cloud service continues to grow and improve its gross margin percentage, our company gross margin should only decline roughly 1 point in FY '17. We now expect our full-year operating expense will be $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion, as we continue to prioritize spend on strategic growth opportunities. \n Lastly, our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is impacted by 3 factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vests. As our cloud continues to gain momentum, we expect our tax rate to increase. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% for the full year, plus or minus 2 points. \n Now to the outlook for the next quarter. Based on current currency rates and forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 2 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q1. By segment, the negative impact is 2 points in Productivity and Business Process, 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.8 billion to $22 billion, in line with historic seasonality. In Productivity and Business Process, we expect revenue to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. We will continue to grow our installed base and drive premium mix through offers like Office 365 E5. We anticipate continued transactional decline as customer migration to the cloud accelerates. \n In our consumer business, we will outpace the consumer PC market. But the benefit from Japan's improved results over a weak prior period and the benefit from last year's Office 2016 launch are not expected to repeat.\n For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, driven by continued annuity strength across Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings, offset by ongoing declines in our transactional on-premises server business and moderating growth from support agreement and enterprise services. \n In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. We anticipate that our OEM revenue will be more in line with overall PC market trends. Devices revenue will decline again from more actions in Phone. Gaming revenue will be driven by the same factors as in Q4. And in search, we expect Bing's growth trajectory to continue. \n We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion with variability due to device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.35 billion and $7.45 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be approximately 0 as realized gains on investment should offset debt expense. \n And with that, Chris, let's go to Q&A. \nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. We'll move now to the Q&A section. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. \nKeith Weiss: I wanted to dig into Azure. I may have one question for Satya and one question for Amy. Satya, you mentioned the Boeing agreement. What was interesting about that is not just a large company moving significant workloads onto Azure, but from my reading, it sounds like there's a distribution side to this agreement that you guys are going to help them distribute some of those applications on a going forward basis. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on that. Is that a onetime thing? Or is that something that you look to do more often with some of these large companies, moving workloads onto Azure? And then for Amy, thank you for the additional detail on sort of the cloud risk margin profile on a going-forward basis. When we dig into just Azure, you said in the past that you sort of -- you expect to match the gross margin profile of what we're seeing in Amazon Web Services. Does that commentary still hold? And maybe you could give us a sort of mark-to-market on how you're doing in terms of matching up Azure's gross margin profile to what you're seeing from your top competitor there? \nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Keith, for those questions. So let me start on the first one. You're absolutely right that one of the phenomena now is that pretty much anyone who is a customer of Azure is also, in some form, an ISV, and that's no longer just limited to people who are \"in the classic tech industry\" or the software business. That's the same case with GE, it's the same case with Boeing, it's the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with, because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure. And that's something that we will, in fact, have distribution agreements with. And AppSource, it's a pretty major announcement for us because we essentially created, for SaaS applications and infrastructure applications, a way to distribute their applications through us and our channel. And I think it makes, in fact, our cloud more attractive to many of them because of that. So we look for -- I think going forward, we will -- you'll look to see -- or you'll see us do much more of this with many other customers of ours. \nAmy Hood: And to your question on Azure gross margin specifically and how we think about that in comparison. Let me first say the additional color I gave in terms of comments, in terms of material improvement, clearly also apply to our Azure portfolio as well. We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year-over-year, and we do expect a material improvement in FY '17, both from the benefits of scale and the investments we've made, but importantly also, in the revenue trajectory we're seeing and the makeup of that revenue. Boeing's agreement is one such agreement in terms of embedding a sort of premium service at a premium gross margin. We signed many of those this quarter that we feel quite good about. We -- I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS' margin profile and still feel good about the progress we're making not just on the workloads that are relevant, apples-to-apples with Azure, but also in our broader cloud portfolio and our ability to have very healthy margins across Dynamics 365 as well as Office 365 in conjunction with many of the innovations we're doing across Azure. So while I am focused on both the workload improvement, I'm also focused on what's possible across the entirety of the cloud. Thanks, Keith. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. \nKarl Keirstead: So Satya or Amy, last quarter, the stock was hit in part on a deceleration in your on-premise server product business. And I think your commentary around the transactional part of that suggested it softened a little bit. I think your tone on this call is a lot better around the transactional performance, and it looks like that business accelerated a little bit. Perhaps you could explain what changed in the course of the 3 months to make the transactional piece, at least, if I'm hearing you correctly, feel a little bit better. \nSatya Nadella: Yes. Let me start, and then Amy you can add to it. Overall, Karl, the focus for us is in what I would describe as this hyperscale plus hybrid approach when you think about the cloud approach, which is pretty unique to us. And the way we track progress is to see how is our annuity growth of our server business and how is our cloud growth. And if you look at this last quarter, we -- our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits, and that's a pretty healthy growth rate and that's something that, by design, both in terms of the technical architecture as well as the traction we have in the marketplace and our sales efforts and so on, are playing out well and we are very bullish about that going forward. The transactional business is much more volatile because of the macro environment, IT budgets and also the secular shift to the cloud. The question again that gets asked is about the cannibalization. But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud. So at a fundamental long-term secular basis, we have new growth, new workloads, and that's what we are focused on and that's a much bigger addressable market than anything our transactional server business had in the past. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. \nBrent Thill: Amy, in Q3, the transactional business was weak, and you said that the business bounced back in Q4. Was that just a mere fact of you cleaning up some of the flip business? Or did you see additional strength on top of some of those closed transactions on the transactional business in Q4? \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. I -- let me split your question into 2 components. The first thing really that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter, every month is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and, specifically, to the cloud. We structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-market to how we think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural transition in the market. And so to your question on transactional performance, there were some deals that didn't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4. And there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with large companies that I'm thrilled by. But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget constraints, especially on transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have accountability to do that in the field. But our first priority every time is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion. \nBrent Thill: Just to be clear, Amy, in terms of the sales motion, are they incented more towards cloud versus transactional going into this year? \nAmy Hood: Yes. \nSatya Nadella: Absolutely. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. \nHeather Bellini: Great. Satya, I had a question for you on Azure. I was just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of Azure revenue coming from ISVs. And then how do you see this helping you compete with AWS? And can you talk about why these partners may be choosing you over the competition? \nSatya Nadella: Sure. Let me take that second part in terms of what is our differentiation. And in my remarks, I sort of pointed out the couple of dimensions. But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers because we meet them where the realities are today and also the digital transformation needs going forward. So that's one massive advantage we have. And the second area for us is also the nexus between what's happening in Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource and, in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform. At our Partner Conference, there was significant amount of excitement with the tools that we announced like Power Apps and Power BI, Azure Functions and Flow. These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to be able to customize applications around Azure. And so to me, that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us. And then, lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers, not only is .NET first-class, but Linux is first-class, Java is first-class, Azure Container Service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux, so, again, speaks to the enterprise realities. So those would be the places where we are fairly differentiated, and that's what you see us gaining, both for enterprise customers and ISVs. The question you asked is an interesting one, which is if I had to sort of slice it by classic ISVs, it would be 1/3 or so of our revenue. But the thing that -- the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer is also an ISV. So every customer who starts off consuming Azure is also turning what is their IP in some -- most cases, into an ISV solution, which ultimately will even participate in AppSource. So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways. \nAmy Hood: And I would also add, Heather, the importance of the motion in our field organization and go-to-market with ISVs is incredibly high in terms of selling with and along with those ISVs, both making them successful and thereby helping us build very important scale through the platform. And we've seen a lot of improvement in the past 4 quarters on that front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of the Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. \nMark Moerdler: Amy, how much of the weakness in transactional has been caused by clients that otherwise would have bought a license now under annuity? In other words, are you driving the transactional weakness to some extent by driving the growth in on-prem? And then I have a quick follow-up for Satya. \nAmy Hood: It's probably not exactly how I would say it, Mark. I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led. That cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and perform their own business is certainly a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time transactional purchasers especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long-term. And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle for good reason, but I would generally point back to say that most of these are driven at the structural level, which is structurally, over time, on-premises transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure through an annuity revenue stream. Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really budget -- is either budget constraint, a macroeconomic economic change or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent. But again, I don't view that as negative performance, I view that as a strategic relevance long-term inside of digital accounts. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. \nWalter Pritchard: Amy, I'm wondering, you're seeing -- you saw very strong unearned revenue in the quarter, but I note that you saw contracted backlog that grew sequentially below what a typical June quarter does, and commercial bookings that were up about 4% off of a fairly easy comp. And I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the dynamics between -- in new and renewal signings that drove that combination of really strong unearned but somewhat weaker trends in the bookings. \nAmy Hood: Sure. Strong unearned, in particular, was actually better-than-expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide. And I think we were quite pleased by that performance. In terms of C&B, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base. Quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring. And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago. So the fact that we were able to grow on that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. \nRaimo Lenschow: Two questions on the Office side. First of all, you're obviously, really reaching the very large numbers in terms of the numbers of seats that you have. Can you talk a little bit about towards the seat growth because both for consumer and for commercial, it seemed to be coming down? Is that kind of the law of large numbers coming in? Or is there anything else? And then in Consumer Office, so the Consumer Office performance was very, very strong and almost needs to be stronger from transactions because otherwise, I don't get to the numbers. Can you talk a little bit about the source of the strength there? \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Raimo. Let me start with the Office Consumer question. We haven't had a chance to touch on that, and then we'll talk about commercial seat growth. You're right; the Office Consumer growth still has quite a bit of transactional business to it, even though we have moved. And you saw that growth of the subscriber base sort of materially. The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really 2 things that are transactionally focused. One, the PC market was a little better than we thought and, particularly, in developed markets, the PC growth was better than we thought. And developed markets are where we see the most transactional business with Consumer Office that impacts in quarter. So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer, and so that's how to think about that big delta. The other thing was Japan was a little better. And when Japan is better, it's why you also see the interesting relationship in constant currency. We have a lot of yen exposure in that segment, so the Japan performance being better also helped. And that is a purely -- it's more transactional than even our rest of world business. So you're right, Raimo, in terms of what impacted that number in quarter versus the underlying market dynamics. On commercial seats, listen, we're very proud of that big number -- growth number. But you're right; we're also getting a very big base. And so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our installed base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. \nGregg Moskowitz: Amy, you spoke about a slowdown in the cloud CapEx growth curve in fiscal '17. I assume you're referring to the growth in absolute dollars moderating and not just the rate of change in percentage terms, but any additional color that you could provide on the company's CapEx requirements over the course of the next year would be appreciated. \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Gregg. You're right; my comments are more pivoted toward the absolute dollar amount, which is what I intend to focus on in my comments, so that's a good clarification, and thanks for asking. In terms of how we think about the absolute numbers, first, I should say, I think most people assume, and it is true to a certain extent, so much of this is the growth in our commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365, and that's true. But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure: Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox LIVE business going forward. And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our Productivity business and Office, do require capital spend. And so the growth is pretty broad-based to support. And so as I think about moderation, it is the absolute dollar. It's from -- it's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue. And I want to be clear on that, it really is about continuing to benefit from scale and engineering improvements that will allow us to do that even as we see broad-based growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. \nRoss MacMillan: Amy, I had one on the same lines on CapEx, and I just wondered if you could provide some insights. We're at 26 data center regions today. I think you have 34 planned, so that would imply we're about 3/4 of the way through that spending cycle. But should we view 34 as a ceiling? Or is it possible that we could see further data center regions built out beyond that 34? And then I had one follow-up. \nSatya Nadella: Sure. Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to this. In some sense, Ross, you're sort of trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to serve using the cloud all over the world. The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume some very simplistically that, that digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach because, right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long-term to be able to meet them where they are. And that's what you see us. We were the only cloud that operates in China under Chinese law; the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law. And these are very critical competitive advantages to us. And so we will track that, and we will be very demand-driven. So there is -- in this case, we're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand. If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down, so it will be demand-driven. But I don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision to open a new region, we will do so. \nAmy Hood: And I would add, in addition to the number of regions, which Satya is talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region. Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location. The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required. So there's really 2 components. And I think Satya talked about why you would enter a region, and it's ROI and there's also their correlation to how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand. \nRoss MacMillan: Maybe just one quick follow-up, the server products business that Karl talked about did rebound this quarter, and I think it was up about 4% constant currency for the year. I know you're not guiding to that number specifically, and you talked about potential volatility. But is there any sort of range of outcomes that you're thinking about for that business? Will it grow? Is it not clear that it will grow? I'd just love any additional color there. \nAmy Hood: In terms of server products and services, I tend to think of it as the all-up growth. It's really about growing the cloud, growing the hybrid and then whatever happens in the transactional business happens. And we -- I'm very proud, actually, of the growth this quarter. I think our guide for Q1, given some of the headwinds we expect in terms of support agreements that we talked about in enterprise services, continues to expect very healthy double-digit annuity growth, driven fundamentally by Azure in that segment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. \nMichael Turits: Satya, around the LinkedIn announcement, there was a lot of discussion about some of the opportunities to use the assets and information there to help build your HCM and CRM capabilities. And then we fairly shortly afterwards got the announcement of Dynamics 365 and AppSource. So maybe given the amount of discussion here, you could comment on the evolution of the strategy and your thought process around broad enterprise application. \nSatya Nadella: Thanks for that question. So I sort of look at what we are doing with Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource, LinkedIn as all being part of one strategy. So the move to the cloud for our customers and for us is not just about a new way of delivering the same value just to the service. It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services. So that's what this notion of a graph represents. So when somebody moves to Office 365, their graph, their people, their relationships with other people inside the organization, their work artifacts all move to the cloud. You can connect them with all the business process data that's in Dynamics 365. But not just in Dynamics 365, but all the applications in AppSource because business process will always be a much more fragmented market as opposed to just one market share leader by industry, by vertical, by country. And so that's our strategy there. And now the professional cloud or the professional network helps usage across all of that professional usage. Whether it's in Office 365 or whether you are a salesperson using any application related to sales, you want your professional network there. Of course, it's relevant in recruiting, it's relevant in training, it's relevant in marketing. So that's really our strategy with LinkedIn as the professional network meeting the professional cloud. And so you're right to point out that these are all part of one overarching strategy and, ultimately, it's about adding value to customers. \nChris Suh: Thanks so much. We'll have time for one more question, please. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. \nMark Murphy: Yes. So Satya, we noticed Office 365 commercial seat growth of 45% produced Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 59% in constant currency, so a favorable spread of about 14 points, suggesting ASP growth. I'm wondering if you could help us understand the drivers, both now and into the future, particularly in terms of the initial response to the E5 plan and also, which products you think are driving the strength as you consider across Exchange, Skype for Business, Power BI, Yammer, SharePoint, et cetera. \nSatya Nadella: Yes. Let me start. And, Amy, you can add to it. Overall, I would say, even in this last year, even just a broader spread of E3 has driven a lot of the growth. And then, of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5. And E5 value proposition across all 3 of the areas, whether it's cloud voice or analytics or security, are all 3 massive areas for us. And I would say, if anything, the initial data from customers around security is very -- is gaining a lot of traction. But we're -- at the same time, one of the things that customers are looking for is making an enterprise-wide architectural decision across all of the workloads. So E3, E5 and higher penetration of this is what's going to drive ASP growth. And you will look to -- you can see -- you'll see us add more value to these packages as time goes on as well because our R&D is focused on that, which is how do we take these buckets of value creation and reinforce them with all of the future R&D as well. \nChris Suh: Thanks, Mark. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast, and you can follow our comments at the Microsoft Investor Relations website. Please contact us if you need any additional details, and thank you for joining us today. \nAmy Hood: Thanks, all. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 3, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-04-21 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Microsoft's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed. \nChris Suh: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.\n On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you could find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\n Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. \n All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change to our external reporting segments, we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently, cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.\n Please note that in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation. One of the more significant changes required that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1, 2015, and hence, impacts our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal 2016. You can find additional information in the financial summary slide deck and in our 10-Q filing.\n We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask the question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 21, 2017.\n During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Overall, we had a solid quarter. Amy and I look forward to sharing more about the results and what's ahead. \n We delivered $22.1 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $6.8 billion. We exceeded $10 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate. We are halfway to our FY '18 goal of $20 billion. This quarter, we surpassed 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. We're proud of our progress and look forward to making more as enterprise deployments accelerate. \n Now let's get to the specifics of each of our 3 segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. We set out to reinvent Productivity and Business Process because we believe that people should get more out of every moment, and organizations should be able to reach new levels of effectiveness. \n This approach is opening up new growth opportunity for Microsoft in 3 ways: We can reach more users, enter new markets and build a developer platform. Let me talk through each. First, we are reaching new users and strengthening our productivity platform. Consumer subscriptions of Office grew to more than 22 million. Devices with our mobile apps grew approximately 4x year-over-year. Commercial Office 365 customers surpassed 70 million monthly active users and we grew seats by 57%. \n Second, we are expanding into new markets such as security, analytics and cloud voice where we see an opportunity and where we can differentiate. For example, the cybersecurity market is expanding rapidly and it's a place where we have unique capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, cloud app security and advanced e-discovery. This combination drove a 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365. A key driver of this growth is our new premium Office 365 Suite, E5. \n Lastly, we're making Office 365 more than a world-class productivity and communication service. It's becoming a growing platform for developers. There is an incredible amount of value developers can deliver by harnessing the data in this platform. It can be as simple as Starbucks enabling somebody to e-mail a cup of coffee or it can be as sophisticated a doc you signed, streamlining processes for digital signatures based on the understanding of people's availability and organizational hierarchy. \n We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs and opening Skype to developers. This is generating developer momentum. In fact, active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs are up month-over-month. \n In business process application, our Dynamics product line is expanding to include new scenarios such as IoT field service, customer self-service and built-in business intelligence and advanced analytics. For example, Ecolab uses CRM Online with Azure IoT not only to help their customers use water systems more efficiently but also to predict equipment failure and direct field engineers to respond. \n And Just Eat in the U.K. uses Dynamics AX to make it easy for millions of people to order food for takeouts online. These scenarios are driving new growth. Dynamics CRM Online speeds to more than double this quarter, with over 80% of our new CRM customers deploying in the cloud. We grew Dynamics AX revenue double digits. \n Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The cloud is being built into every organization's quest to optimize and grow. With our results this quarter, it remains clear we're 1 of the 2 leaders in this market. Azure revenue increased 120% in constant currency, with revenue from premium services growing triple-digit for the seventh consecutive quarter. \n We are innovating in new areas to help organizations digitally transform. We are expanding our competitive strength in hybrid computing. We're generating opportunity for developers and partners. To start, we added more differentiation to high-value services in Azure this quarter in 3 areas that are top of mind for our customers: artificial intelligence, IoT and business analytics. \n We expanded Cortana Intelligence Suite, our Big Data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action. It now includes over 20 cognitive services ranging from object and emotion recognition to text and linguistic analysis. \n The IoT market is expanding as companies look to deliver new services and value. Our new Azure IoT Suite streamlines the process of building IoT applications and acts as the hub for managing and monitoring millions of assets. Each week, more than 2 trillion IoT messages are processed by Azure. \n And analytics is another rapidly growing market, where Power BI has more than 200,000 customers and 5 million users. Companies like Toyota, BMW, Johnson Controls are all using Cortana Intelligence Suite, Azure IoT and Power BI to transform themselves as well as their industry. Siemens is also using Azure to connect and analyze data for medical imaging systems around the world, helping provide us in their effort to transform health care. \n We're the only cloud provider that helps companies embrace the cloud on their own term. And we continue to innovate in areas that make it easier for our customers, including the recently released preview of Azure Stack and by bringing SQL Server to Linux. \n A critical part of this flexibility is giving customers tools to secure their data wherever it is, on-premise, in the cloud and across all their devices. We continue to grow in this market, with Enterprise Mobility Suite customers more than doubling to over 27,000. This is 3 consecutive quarters of triple-digit customer growth. \n This growth is driven by strong adoption across cloud services. For example, more than 1/3 of our Office 365 enterprise suite installed base has also purchased Enterprise Mobility services. And as I said earlier, perhaps the biggest impact we can make is to empower developers. To this end, we are making Windows and Azure the very best environment for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms. Our acquisition of Xamarin and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and app that leverage our cloud and run natively on Windows, iOS and Android. We are excited to announce a build that we are making Xamarin freely available as part of Visual Studio. \n Now let's move to More Personal Computing segment. We are reinventing personal computers and personal computing for the mobile-first cloud-first world. In this world, what matters most is the mobility of a person's experience, not any one single device. \n As I shared last quarter, we think about our strategy along 3 lines: first, we will deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customer; second, we will grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform; third, we will innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. \n First, let me talk through the innovation we are delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use, trust productivity to Windows and specifically, more value to our enterprise customers. What we hear most frequently from these customers is how much they value the advanced productivity, security and device management capabilities in Windows 10. In fact, this is what led to one of the most security-conscious organizations in the world, United States Department of Defense, to upgrade all of their PCs and mobile devices to Windows 10 this year. We see this trend across our enterprise customers, with 83% of them in active pilots to date. \n We believe enterprise deployments will continue to drive up the over 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The number of Windows 10 devices is twice that of Windows 7 over the same time period since launch. \n At build, we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in ink and touch interfaces as well as Windows Hello biometric security and deeper integration with Cortana, all coming this summer with the Windows 10 anniversary update. \n Second, we're seeing new monetization through services across the Windows platform. Windows Store received more than 5 billion visits. We are excited about compelling new apps coming from Disney, Square Enix, Bank of America, King, Instagram and many others. \n We grew the number of universe of Windows app developers 60% this quarter. In search, developers have already built over 1,000 apps designed for Cortana. These new third-party experiences and the 6.3 billion questions people have asked are helping make Cortana smarter and driving search engagement. Over 35% of our search revenue last month came from Windows 10 devices. \n In gaming, monthly active users of Xbox LIVE grew 26% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows 10. Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement. At the same time, we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows 10 devices. Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows 10 by 50% over last quarter. And starting this summer, universal Windows app will run on Xbox One, making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices.\n Third, we continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEM. We are pleased with the results from Surface this quarter. This is our second billion-dollar revenue quarter for Surface in a row, and it's the first outside of a holiday period. Revenue grew 61% in constant currency, driven by Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Certainly, consumers value these devices, but where we see the strongest momentum is through adoption in the commercial space, with particular strength in financial services, manufacturing and health care. \n Our OEM partners are also innovating in new device areas for consumers and business customers. In particular, they too are seeing growth in the 2-in-1 device category. As you can see, we think about renewing growth of Windows. We think broadly about where growth can come from. We see early signs of success in Windows driving increased engagement and monetization of services like search, store and gaming as well as new sources of revenue from Surface. As we build premium devices and premium categories, we're also stimulating demand across our entire ecosystem.\n Ultimately, the largest potential for Microsoft's growth will come through reinvention of personal computers and personal computing as well as the new platforms we create. This broader mobile-first cloud-first opportunity cuts across all of our financial segments and technology ambition. And this is what we shared with developers at Build and with business leaders at Envision a few weeks ago. I hope you have had the chance to watch these events as well. \n We're creating entirely new ways for people to interact with technology and also new ways for them to build technology. HoloLens developer kit is one such example. Organizations around the world like Volvo and NASA are using HoloLens to redefine what it means to build and explore and Case Western Universities redefining how students learn to be world-class surgeons. \n Conversational interface is another example. We envision a world where people will more naturally interact with their devices in the future through conversations. Imagine simply asking Cortana to book a hotel or being able to order a pizza through instant message in Skype. Conversations will be a new platform that every business, every app and every website will begin to embrace, and we're at the forefront driving this platform shift. \n We are building out cloud services and platform to enable every business across every industry to digitally transform themselves, and in turn, build their own capability to create more digital technology. Empowering people and organizations to thrive in this digital world is central to Microsoft's mission. I'm proud of our execution so far and what we have achieved, and I'm also grounded in the work ahead of us. \n With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions. \nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.1 billion, up 2% and up 5% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly, but was up 4% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 1% and 10% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.62, flat year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Our effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we anticipated, which impacted our EPS. \n From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as anticipated. However, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa were more unfavorable than we expected. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy fundamentals, which led to a solid quarter of results. Commercial bookings increased 7%, up 9% in constant currency. Our total commercial annuity business had double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, and commercial annuity mix reached 86%, up 4 points year-over-year. \n Commercial unearned revenue grew to just under $18.8 billion, up 3% and 8% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier. \n Our contracted not billed balance again exceeded $25 billion. Most important, as Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $10 billion. This quarter, more than 65% of customers who signed enterprise agreements attached our commercial cloud offers, up 15 points from last year. \n Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling road map. Our commercial cloud gross margin was 45% this quarter, declining year-over-year. This decrease was driven by a higher mix of Azure revenue, our ongoing investment in data center capacity and geographic expansion and the small FX headwind. \n As I mentioned last quarter, even as we are focused on gross margin improvement within each of our key cloud services, our total commercial cloud gross margin will reflect the dynamics of changing revenue mix and targeted investment. \n In Q3, the FX impact of 3 points on year-over-year revenue growth was generally in line with the guidance, as the recent weakening in the U.S. dollar created less than 1 point of impact overall and across segments. As Chris explained earlier, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 1 point on operating expenses at the total company level. \n As expected, our company gross margin percentage declined this quarter, driven by our accelerating mix of cloud services and our Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segment, offset by higher gross margin percentage performance from products within More Personal Computing. \n Now to our segment results. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.5 billion in revenue, increasing 1% and 6% in constant currency, with higher annuity mix, offsetting lower transactional weakness results due to a weaker PC market.\n In Office commercial, revenue was flat and grew 7% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Office 365 with installed base growth across Office, Exchange, SharePoint and Skype workload. Our channel again expanded this quarter as more than 85,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers. \n Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency due to an increasing base of subscribers and recurring subscription revenue. And our Dynamics business grew 4%, up 9% in constant currency. We more than doubled CRM Online seats for the sixth consecutive quarter. \n Segment gross margin dollars declined 4%, up 1% in constant currency. As we've discussed, gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment. Operating expenses decreased 1% even as we continued engineering investments in our Office 365 and Dynamics businesses and prioritized spend in growth areas like E5, security and voice capabilities. As a result, operating income declined 7%.\n The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.1 billion in revenue, which grew 3% and 8% in constant currency, just at the low end of our guidance range. Our total server products and cloud services revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 5% in constant currency. Against the prior year comparable, we had 16% constant currency growth. \n This quarter, our enterprise server customers continued their commitment to our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in double-digit annuity revenue growth in constant currency, including over 100% growth in Azure. That growth was partially offset by a larger-than-expected decline in our transactional on-premise server business, which impacted the in-quarter results. Enterprise services continued to perform well, with 11% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for our support services and solutions.\n Gross margin declined 2% and grew 3% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage declined as cloud mix accelerated, offsetting margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise services. In response to enterprise customer demand and to increase our share in the cloud market, we grew operating expenses by 13% through Azure-focused investments across engineering, additional sales and marketing capacity and the acquisition of Xamarin. This quarter, operating income declined 14%. \n Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $9.5 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 2% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market, which was weaker than we expected. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by a higher-than-expected mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue underperformed the commercial PC market, declining 11% due to the higher inventory level in Q2 that I mentioned in my last earnings commentary. \n Windows volume licensing grew 6% in constant currency, and IP licensing continued to decline, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of lower royalty units. As expected, devices revenue decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 11% or 9% in constant currency, primarily due to phone. Revenue declined 46% in constant currency. \n Additionally, sell-through of our Lumia products was weak, and we exited the quarter with relatively high channel inventory. As Satya mentioned, momentum in our Surface business continued as revenue increased 56% or 61% in constant currency with strong commercial and consumer demand for our service lineup. Overall, device gross margin dollars grew and gross margin percentage improved, primarily driven by a shift to our higher gross margin Surface portfolio. \n Our search business remained strong this quarter, with growth driven by higher revenue per search and higher search volume. We again had U.S. PC share growth and search continued to be profitable. \n In gaming, revenue grew 4% or 6% in constant currency, with continued progress in the monetization of our installed base. We saw higher revenue from Xbox LIVE, driven by both higher volumes of transaction and higher revenue per transaction as well as an increase in revenue from our gaming studios. As expected, Xbox hardware revenue declined, mainly driven by lower Xbox 360 consoles sold and lower Xbox One pricing. \n Segment gross margin increased 2% or 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily through our actions in phone and the transition of our display business to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 57%.\n Now back to our overall company results. As planned, we accelerated our data center and cloud services investments to meet growing global demand. This quarter, we invested $2.3 billion in total capital expenditures, including an increase of 65% year-over-year primarily for data centers and servers. Other income was negative $247 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividends, interest income and net recognized gains on investments. \n Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we expected, which reflected the changing mix of revenue across geographies as well as an accelerating shift in revenue from software licensing to cloud services. The rate for the quarter included a catch-up adjustment from Q1 and Q2, reflecting the new full year -- the new expected full year non-GAAP effective tax rate. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \n Now let's move to the outlook. First on FX. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we still expect FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points. By segment, we expect 3 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points in Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing. \n Second, our commercial business. Our commercial business will be on pace for continued strong annuity growth as both new and existing enterprise customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of cloud services. Even with projections of tightening global IT spend and currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We remain on track toward our $20 billion commercial cloud revenue run rate goal as we grow revenue, drive consumption and focus on gross margin improvement in Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online.\n Finally, we will continue our investment in data centers in capital equipment to address customer demand for our cloud services. With that, let me share our view by segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to be $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, with continued annuity shift to the cloud offsetting the impact of a weaker PC market on our transactional business and our consumer and commercial segments. \n In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, driven by annuity growth, offset by continued transactional weakness. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. \n Here's a bit more detail on its individual components. In Windows, we expect our OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, similar to what we saw in Q3, primarily due to continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In devices, we anticipate continued momentum and growth for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, particularly with business customers. For phone, we expect year-over-year revenue declines to steepen in Q4 as we work through our Lumia channel position. In search, we will continue to show healthy revenue growth with full year profitability.\n Finally, in gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform and we look forward to E3, where we will announce new titles for the upcoming fiscal year. We expect COGS to be $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, and we expect operating expenses between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion. Our full year guidance is now down to $31 billion to $31.1 billion as we concentrate our investments in engineering and technical sales to accelerate our cloud growth heading into the next fiscal year. \n We expect other income and expenses to be negative $200 million in Q4. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense, offset by dividend and interest income. For tax, based on trends reflected in this quarter's full year catch-up adjustment, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be 21% and 23%. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. \n Before I wrap up, I'd like to share a few directional comments on fiscal '17. This year, we saw strong growth in our commercial cloud portfolio, and we grew our annuity penetration across our commercial business. We anticipate those trends will continue next fiscal year, driving our revenue growth and impacting our gross margin percentages. \n As we continue to unify and modernize our Windows installed base across our consumer and business customers, we will advance our progress and our postsale monetization scenarios and execute on the Windows 10 enterprise deployment opportunity. \n Throughout fiscal '16, our significant investment in engineering, sales and marketing has positioned us to support our customers' digital transformation and to innovate in device form factors like Surface and HoloLens. In fiscal '17, we expect to continue that investment and reallocation process. Therefore, total operating expenses should be flat to up slightly. I look forward to sharing more on our FY '17 plans in July. With that, Chris, let's go to Q&A. \nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. \nBrent Thill: Amy, just on the Q4 guide. You're guiding below the Street on many of the individual line items on the top line. I'm just curious, is this more of a shift to the cloud? Or is there some demand execution issues that you're seeing in the business? \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. It's really, as we talked about, transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process. We're continuing to expect strong annuity growth. We're continuing to expect a strong mix of the cloud. We're continuing to expect ARPU increases, premium mix increases and installed-base growth. So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment. In Intelligent Cloud, it's a very similar dynamic. We're expecting renewal rates to remain strong as they've been. We're expecting the mix to Azure to continue to grow. We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth. And again, it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall as well as some -- the very specific geo weakness we saw, which I called out earlier. And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone. So I would really focus on that in that segment. The rest of it frankly is quite good. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. \nPhilip Winslow: I just want to focus in on Office here. Obviously, you called out Office 365 commercial seats growing 57% year-over-year, so very consistent with what last quarter was. And Satya, you mentioned the mix shift as well with the release of E5. Wondering if you could just provide some color there, sort of, I guess, a grade of kind of where you are right now, and then as you're contemplating your guidance for Q4 and then kind of thinking about 2017, how should we figure how are you guys thinking about sort of that Office 365 transition there, sort of units and pricing? \nSatya Nadella: I can start, and then Amy, you can add. Overall, the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 endpoints everywhere and good usage. And I talked about how the mobile endpoints has been growing and the mobile usage has been growing. I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office. So we feel very good about that, which is users both in terms of coverage and usage. The next place where we are very focused on is really the new scenarios. And E5 is obviously a big element of it. I talked about it in some detail. The security value proposition, that is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice. So we're in the very early innings of E5, but the value proposition and the TAM or the total addressable market of those 3 scenarios is huge, and so we remain very excited about it. The other thing that I'm also sort of excited about when it comes to Office 365 is for the first time, we're opening up Office 365 not just as a end user and a enterprise tool in the service but as a developer platform. In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have. And with the Microsoft Graph API and what we see as activity around it, we think about the platform effects of that is also being very key. So that's, at least at the macro level, how I look at it and Amy, if you want to talk a little more about... \nAmy Hood: Yes, and I think the way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud. You'd expect to continue to see installed base growth. As even some of the items Satya talked about have more relevance and continue to make us, the value prop higher even in small business, which is where you've seen the user adds. I would continue to expect to see ARPU growth as we see E5 have its impact through the year. And so think about these same dynamics fill for us where we focus on new users and ARPU increases as we shift to Office 365. Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into '17. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. \nMark Moerdler: So if you look at Productivity and Process and Intelligent Cloud, obviously, we're having a margin decrease that's occurring and a good chunk of that is cloud. How should we think about the standalone license business in terms of the margin separated from the cloud side of it? \nAmy Hood: The standalone margins on the licensing business have been pretty stable just because transactionally, we understand and continue to bring down the fixed cost base there and any that's required. So I don't feel like you'd expect any material change in those, Mark. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. \nHeather Bellini: Satya, I wanted to see if you could share a little bit on Azure, just how you're thinking about the competitive positioning versus Amazon, where you think your strengths are versus them. And also as the business continues to ramp at such a fast pace, how do we think about the progression in gross margins? I mean, Amazon gives us operating margins, but I guess, I'm wondering, is there a reason you shouldn't be able to reach similar operating margins with Azure at a similar scale if we went back and looked at the progression that Amazon's been disclosing? \nSatya Nadella: Sure, Heather. Thanks for the question. First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx as well as our OpEx, both on the engineering side as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about they're still at Microsoft Cloud level, just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, that attach to Office 365, essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences. So we think about this more holistically and same thing with Dynamics. But having said that is to your specific question of where our differentiation lies. The first one is hybrid. Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server. We obviously support that with all of our service. Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment right, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows Server, and you will see that increasingly even in this next wave of servers. But we also think of, in fact, our servers at the edge of our cloud. That I think is where the world is going to go to, where distributed computing will remain distributed. So Azure Stack is completely unique to Microsoft. No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability. So I would say that's another point of differentiation. So to your point about margins, I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights. That's a different margin structure. We will have IaaS services, and you talked about the existence proof at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there. We have PaaS services in infrastructure like EMS that have SaaS-like rev margins. And then, of course, we have SaaS services in Office 365. So I think the mix of our growth -- rather, that mix will define our long-term gross margin and operating margin for our cloud services. But the mix will also shift each quarter just because the mix is not a stable mix. We'll see growth in different parts at different times. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. \nKeith Weiss: Amy, when you're talking about the transactional declines, particularly [indiscernible] and the server portion of that, can you help us understand how much of that is due to maybe more macro factors, weaker overall server spending environment? And how much of that comes from perhaps demand being reallocated towards Infrastructure as a Service offerings that you guys have in Azure? Is there something like a cannibalization taking place within that transactional business today? \nAmy Hood: Keith, it's a good question. Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business. First, you're right. There's clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business. Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets where we have a higher percentage of non-annuity business, transactional business. Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment. And specifically, some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place. And so you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the Intelligent Cloud segment and the server weakness is there. And because frankly, we saw that macro weakness, you've even seen it in terms of server shipments, right? If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement. We didn't see it in any one particular workload. It's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. And so I actually think between those 2 items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter. And I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these 2 quarters. So I think less about it being cannibalistic because so many of the scenarios in this time period we've seen the growth we expected. We've seen it across our premium services as well as core compute. I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures. We also saw, and I would expect, annuity shifts there, which is the final component. Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud. And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. And so for me, I do tend to think it's a bit more of the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is frankly any other statement or execution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. \nKarl Keirstead: Amy, this one's for you. I wouldn't mind asking about the gross margin guidance. If I take the midpoint of your revenue guidance, midpoint of your COGS guidance, it looks like you're guiding to another roughly 200 basis point decline in gross margins in the June quarter, which is about what you did in March. So if we look out to fiscal '17, I know you touched on it a little bit, but just to be clear, it feels like you're guiding to a further year-over-year decline in gross margins, but sounds like that'll be offset in part by continued good OpEx control. So is that the right way to think about it? And is there any way that you could sort of bracket what the gross margin percentage decline might be in fiscal '17? You probably don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe some high-level color. \nAmy Hood: Directional -- Karl, thanks for the question. And you're right. In general, let me spend a few seconds on that. You're right. We saw about 200 basis point change this quarter. It's entirely due to the shift to the cloud, both in our Productivity and Business Process segment as well as the Intelligent Cloud segment. Those are the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4. And I would expect stability as we've seen it in our More Personal Computing segment. And so as you think about '17, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist. And you're right in that our strong operating expense focus, because really this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now, us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering sales and marketing. And you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into '17 within the overall envelope I discussed. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. \nWalter Pritchard: Amy, my question just on guidance and your posture on guidance, a 2-part question. I think we've seen you give very conservative guidance, say for the first half of this year. And in Q3, you ended up sort of, put it all together, at the lower end of your guidance. And I'm wondering, your posture just generally around guidance, if it's changed at all that you're factoring things differently and we should think about that range going forward, should it be more like it's been in the past where you've had very conservative assumptions or more like what you just did here? And then the second part is if you look forward maybe towards longer-term guidance and the prospects of giving longer-term guidance because I don't think I've seen an estimate spread on a company as large as this in a long time, how are you thinking about possibly giving long-term guidance? What are the factors that are influencing your comfort in doing that? Or is it more philosophical and it's something you're just -- you're not going to do that's not necessarily dependent on your view of the business? \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Walter. My philosophical position doesn't change much. I give the guidance that I expect for the quarter, and I do it on the earnings call to the best of my ability. What you've seen this quarter is, in fact, the biggest in-quarter delta for us all the time is the non-annuity performance. And in our -- all of our segments, that is transactional business. That is the most impacted in quarter by budget changes or macro changes. And so the inherent volatility that you are talking about really is about changes in in-quarter that we see and the impact of that. So I don't think it's a philosophical shift. It's just where you see volatility in quarter has always been in the transactional side of our business. The guidance we gave and our annuity positions in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly frankly what we expected, with the small exception of the geos that I called out. So I tend to think -- I'll talk a little bit about '17 as I always do, come July, give you all more of a shape to that. But I tend to think -- I'd like to focus on where the company is going, which is cloud mix shift, annuity growth and overall world view of bringing Windows and the ecosystem grow through MPC. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. \nRoss MacMillan: Amy, I just wanted to go back on the Intelligent Cloud. We did see that deceleration in server product growth. But the comp was very tough and as you commented, your annuity was up and your deferred growth accelerated. That server product line has grown about 5% constant currency in the last 12 months. I guess the question is, is there any structural reason why, going back to Keith's question, why that would decelerate more ex macro? And then another question I just had is related to this. Can you just remind us, in the server product ex Azure line and in the commercial Office traditional non-365 line, how much is transactional in those 2 segments? \nAmy Hood: Sure, Ross. Let me try to take those -- the first question around, is there anything structural or different in that server product line? Really it has been and is that transactional component. You're right, we continue to see the annuity growth. We continue to see the growth through Azure and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason other than this change in my world view other than maybe the budget in macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continuing to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed. In terms of overall rough orders of magnitude, the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%. But that 20%, right, lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see. The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PC. So it's slightly higher all up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nKash Rangan: A question for Amy. Amy, you've been able to grow your op income on constant-currency basis nicely double digits as you've been investing in the cloud. As you look at the results this quarter and as you pointed out the op margins in Intelligent Cloud and business process productivity were impacted due to the shift to the cloud. Do you think that as you look into next year, that the cloud business is at scale that it continues to grow and take share relative to overall revenue? The transaction business, who knows? It could be a bit of a macro pressure. Do you think we're at a point where we could continue to entertain a scenario that op income could still continue to grow nicely as it has in the last 3, 4 quarters? Or is there some other structural change with respect to the margin of the cloud business or maybe the transaction business drops off a lot more dramatically that it may be hard to sustain this nice double-digit op income at a very high level without going into the details? \nAmy Hood: Yes, at a very high level, Kash, let me talk about the opportunity. The opportunity for us across what the cloud mix that's possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I'm a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have. I believe that our setup for that is the investments we've been making for the past couple of years as well as the investments we're going to make for the next couple. I mean that both in the capital concept but also in my operating expense line. We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient and where the returns are not going to be as high or the structural growth isn't there. And so for me, to your point, at a high level, I think we can continue to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue. I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services. I think that we can grow profit dollars. And I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for '17 as we continue to pivot to that opportunity. So I think this is one where my optimism frankly for the structure of the market in the segment you chose and my optimism for positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen. And so I would continue to expect to see us do it. \nKash Rangan: It's good to see that you still expect profit to grow because this seems like the new Microsoft where you're balancing the need to invest strategically, but the same time, trying to grow profits in the near term versus the old Microsoft where the investments were made but with more of a \"longer term\" you never knew when the payoff was going to happen. So it's good to see emphasize that you're still focused on profit growth, notwithstanding the mix of factors that you cannot forecast. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. \nMark Murphy: Satya, regarding the announcement that you will release your SQL Server database on the Linux platform, I was wondering if you can walk us through your decision tree just in terms of what you think the potential risks are and what you think the potential rewards are of reaching for that level of openness, if you will. And just how impactful do you think that, that product can be in enhancing Microsoft's share of the database market? \nSatya Nadella: Thanks for the question. So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I'd say the increased competitiveness of SQL Server. If you think about where SQL Server now with this new release, SQL Server 2016, it's become a fantastic database for many, many of the workloads, everything from OLTP to data warehousing to BI to advanced analytics. For the Tier 1, this is a capability that's been multiple decades in the work, but here we are with very competitive total cost of ownership, price competitiveness but with a technology that is, in many cases, as Gartner talks about, at the top of the charts when it comes to all of these workloads. So now that we find yourselves with that capability, we're saying, \"Look, what's the way to think about market -- all the markets that we can, in fact, take this product to.\" And the Linux operating system database market is not something that -- which is mostly primarily a Tier 1 segment, is something that we never worked in. And so, therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity so we take that. We've already made the call that Azure Linux's FirstClass. We already have 20-plus points of -- or 20-plus percent of VMs in Azure or Linux and we'll all increasingly have Linux via big share of percentage of what is happening in Azure. So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about that entire data estate across Windows and Linux. People don't really move between operating systems. Those choices have been made. But at the same time, now they have a choice around database. And so we think that, that's a very good incremental opportunity for us. \nOperator: And our last question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. \nS. Kirk Materne: Satya, I wanted to talk a little bit about just the ISV ecosystem on top of Azure and where you think that is today and where you'd hope that potentially to be in 12 months when we think about the opportunity around sort of Platform as a Service and building out more enterprise apps. I think you made some comments around some IoT applications that are now sitting on Azure. What's sort of a good -- what should we be looking for in terms of new partners from survey ISV perspective? You've had companies like Blackbaud sort of replatform. I'm wondering, do you expect that sort of momentum to potentially accelerate as we get in further into the calendar year? \nSatya Nadella: Yes, thanks for the question. I mean, I think, overall for me, across all of our product lines, whether it be Windows or whether it be Office 365 or Azure, developer momentum, ISV momentum, is super important priority for us, both in terms of our developer evangelism, our product engineering teams as well as everything that we will do to even create success for our partners through our field sales organization is a top-of-mind priority, and this is something that Kevin Turner, myself and Amy and all of our leadership team is very focused on. So you will only increasingly see us deliver more design wins there. In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners, and in particular, ISVs. The thing that I'm seeing a lot of is we've had traditional strength with SQL as well as .NET. They're moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact, re-platting to be even more multi-tenant and cloud native. At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open-source ISVs also be part of the Azure marketplace. if you go up to the Azure marketplace today, you'll see that. So we're not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them re-plat to a completely new model, but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well, and that's pretty exciting to see. \nChris Suh: Great. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast at the Microsoft Investor Relations website. Thank you -- thanks for joining us today. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you very much. \nAmy Hood: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 2, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-01-28 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Microsoft's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed. \nChris Suh: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.\n On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\n Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on today's call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.\n All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. \n At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.\n Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but excludes the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges.\n We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included on a live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 27, 2017.\n During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead. Overall, this quarter we had solid performance and more importantly, drove growth in areas that are key to our future. We delivered $25.7 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $7.9 billion. We continue to advance towards our goals for fiscal year '18. Our Commercial Cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year-over-year and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months. \n We also made progress towards our goal of more than 1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices, we crossed the 200 million milestone, and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems. In fact, adoption is nearly 140% faster than Windows 7. I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results.\n Now let's get to the specifics for each of the 3 segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. As we seek to help people get more out of every moment, we're delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365. Consumer response to Office is strong. Office attach rate is up, Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time, and consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million. \n We're also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms. On iOS and Android, Skype has more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpassed 340 million this quarter. There are also 30 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook. Office 365 commercial revenue grew nearly 70% in constant currency while seats grew 59%. It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we're delivering in Office 365, and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection.\n In December, we released a major update to Skype for Business, which drives productivity up and cost down. Our customers can now use Skype for business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees. \n Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all our segments. As customers look to protect themselves, we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions. The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25% quarter-over-quarter. At the same time, we released new capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, advanced e-discovery and customer Lockbox. These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration SKU, E5, which we released last month. \n Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud. This quarter, we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM, both of which deliver enhancements in mobility, insights and organizational productivity as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365. 3 out of 4 of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud, which is driving continued triple-digit paid seat growth for CRM Online in the enterprise. \n Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers. This quarter, we exposed the data APIs, which capture the relationships between people, conversations, projects, schedules, processes and content. We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph. The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for our customers and partners. Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs. Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications like Oracle Sales Cloud and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications.\n Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in. Last quarter, I reflected on how we are now 1 of the 2 leaders in this space. At the same time, we are the only one in this market providing SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale. We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously. \n Our unique approach is resonating. Our cloud architecture reflects real-world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation. Azure revenue grew 140% this quarter in constant currency, with revenue coming from new and existing customers. \n We saw organizations like NTT Docomo, Honeywell, NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs, Dow Chemical and the UN Development Programme deploy innovative solutions on Azure. We see that Azure customers who also purchased Office 365 consume 8x more Azure than other customers. More than 70% of the Fortune 500 have at least 2 different Microsoft Cloud offerings, up 13 points year-over-year. \n And now, we're continuing to grow in new ways. Together with Red Hat, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we will increase our ability to address real-world infrastructure needs. These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications with our cloud. \n We are leading innovation in new agile and dev ops workloads as well, with Azure App Service's power apps and Visual Studio team services, where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions. We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas, finance, e-commerce, consulting and health care. \n As we expand into new markets, our revenue from premium services like security, mobility management and analytics nearly tripled year-over-year. Enterprise Mobility solution customers have more than doubled year-over-year, and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months. \n Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption. As threats become more frequent and sophisticated, Azure's unique technologies like machine learning empower customers to adapt to these new realities. This quarter, we organized the enterprise cybersecurity group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks. We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the U.K. that address customers' data access and sovereignty needs. And we continue to release new capabilities like Advanced Threat Analytics as part of our $1 billion product innovation and security, spanning Azure, Office 365, Windows 10 and our Enterprise Mobility Suite. \n At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence, powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future. Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence. We released Cortana Analytics last July. It's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people, places and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation. \n Coca-Cola, Russell Reynolds and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers, uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized health care. Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform.\n In the More Personal Computing segment, I'm encouraged by our progress to unify our installed base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem. As of this month, we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10. \n Near term, in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year, we are focused on 3 ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft: first, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers, who need advanced productivity, security and device management; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third, continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me briefly expand on each.\n First, in November, we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios: security, manageability and ease of deployment. More than 76% of our enterprise customers are in active pilots, including organizations like Kimberly Clarke and Alaska Airlines, and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10. We are well positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half. \n Next, as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform, we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows Store search and gaming. This holiday season, we doubled Windows Store paid transactions from PC and tablet customers. This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up and the addition of new Windows 10 applications. \n This quarter, Netflix, Pandora, Uber, Wall Street Journal, NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences. For example, you can ask Cortana to recognize a song in Shazam, play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber. \n With Search, the clearest indicator of our progress is U.S. search share, where Bing now exceeds 21%. Nearly 30% of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices, partly as a result of user engagements with Cortana. We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions. \n This holiday, we saw record engagement on Xbox LIVE. Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs. On December 28, we had more fans using Xbox LIVE than any other day in the Xbox history. Clearly, with Xbox One now upgraded to Windows 10, a vibrant community joined the Windows ecosystem.\n Our games also performed strongly this quarter. We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft published titles year-over-year. Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10, iOS and Android, and we grew monthly active users by 18% year-over-year.\n Lastly, we're innovating in new device categories and driving growth. With Surface, we created a new type of device, the 2-in-1, and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success. At the same time, this was the best quarter for Surface ever with over $1.3 billion in sales, driven by the launch of Surface Pro 4 and the initial rollout of our brand-new Surface Book. \n We see more opportunity ahead with Surface Book coming soon to China, Japan, the U.K., France, Germany and other markets in Europe and Asia. We believe in our ability to grow the Windows ecosystem. Near term, we are taking the right steps. We are also clear that long-term Windows growth and vibrancy rest on our ability to reinvent personal computers and personal computing. We accept that challenge as we see it as one of the greatest opportunities to prudently expand into new markets and generate shareholder value. \n Before turning over to Amy, I want to briefly reflect on the past few months. I've had the opportunity to meet with customers from all over the globe and observe the effects of the macroeconomic trends impacting business today. Of course, any macroeconomic uncertainty will create pressures for our business. \n But increasingly, I think it also creates opportunity for us. Every organization is looking for ways to gain efficiencies, insights and ultimately transform. This is at the heart of our mission. I believe Microsoft is uniquely positioned to empower them to find new growth areas while finding new growth for ourselves. \n With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions. \nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $25.7 billion, down 2% and up 3% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly, but was up 5% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 3% and 13% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.78, growing 11% or 23% in constant currency.\n We achieved strong results this quarter through targeted investments and innovation and consistent execution. From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as expected. The key markets like Brazil, China, Japan and Russia continue to be challenging. \n Our commercial business once again delivered solid results as we executed well in a large quarter for annuity renewals. Commercial bookings increased 12%, up 19% in constant currency, and commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $19.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. \n In addition, our contracted not billed balance reached an all-time high of $25.5 billion. With our continued cloud growth, our commercial annuity mix reached 83%, up 5 points year-over-year. This quarter, more than 60% of customers with enterprise agreements attached Commercial Cloud services, up 15 percentage points year-over-year. \n Additionally, we continue to make progress in improving our cloud gross margins. In Q2, total Commercial Cloud gross margin was 46%, an increase of 9 points year-over-year, driven primarily by improvements in both Office 365 and Azure. \n Last quarter, I provided the expected foreign currency impact on total revenue as well as across each of the reporting segments. In Q2, the FX impact came in nearly as anticipated though the U.S. dollar trended stronger-than-expected in December. This resulted in less than 1 point of additional negative impact to total revenue as compared to expectations, rounding up to 5 points. \n Consistent with Q1 and as Chris explained, we are not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses, and therefore, segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 3% on operating expenses at the total company level. \n Now let's turn to each segment's results. This quarter, our productivity and business processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.7 billion in revenue, declined 2%, but growing 5% in constant currency. \n In Office commercial, revenue declined 1%, but grew 5% in constant currency, driven by ongoing strength from Office 365 while revenue increased nearly 70% in constant currency. 80,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers, and our installed base continued to expand across Office, Exchange, SharePoint and the Skype for Business workloads. \n Office consumer revenue declined 14%, down 8% in constant currency, ahead of the consumer PC market. Subscribers increased to 20.6 million, attach rates grew and recurring subscription revenue continued to more than offset the impact of the customer transition to the cloud. \n And our Dynamics business grew 3% or 11% in constant currency, with triple-digit installed base growth for Dynamics CRM Online for the fifth consecutive quarter. We look forward to the upcoming launch of Dynamics AX, our ERP cloud solution built on and for Azure, that increases the breadth of our offerings in the business process market. \n Segment gross margin declined 6%, up 1% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined, reflecting the increasing mix of cloud services within the segment. Segment operating expenses decreased 3%, and we repositioned resources to align with our highest growth opportunities. And as a result, operating income declined 8%. \n The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered over $6.3 billion in revenue, slightly ahead of our expectations and grew 5% and 11% in constant currency. Our enterprise customers continued to choose, adopt and use our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in server product and services growth, revenue growth of 10% in constant currency. Additionally, Enterprise services revenue increased 10% or 16% in constant currency, driven by our premier support services.\n Segment gross margin grew 4% or 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat. As the rapid and continued growth of our cloud mix offset margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise services. Given the addressable market opportunity and enterprise customer demand, we continued our investment in research and development as well as sales and marketing resources. This quarter, operating income declined 1%.\n Now to our last segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $12.7 billion, down 5% and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 5% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 3%, outperforming the consumer PC market as we expected. \n Driven by a higher mix of premium and midrange devices, which led to higher average revenue per license than the prior year. OEM Pro revenue declined 6%, slightly better than the commercial PC market. Pro license inventory is slightly above historical levels, which we expect to work through in Q3. \n Windows volume licensing grew 3% in constant currency, with annuity growth partially offset by transactional declines. IP licensing declined, impacted by both the decrease in total unit volume and the higher mix of low royalty units. Our Search business performed well again this quarter. With higher revenue per search, higher search volume and U.S. market share growth, which resulted in continued profitability.\n Devices revenue decreased 26% or 22% in constant currency, primarily due to phone, where revenue declined 49% in constant currency, reflecting our change in strategy announced last July. Surface revenue increased 22% or 29% in constant currency, with the launch of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, with continued channel expansion and growing commercial sales.\n On a constant currency basis, device gross margin dollars declined 18% and gross margin percentage improved, driven by a shift in revenue to our higher-margin Surface portfolio. As Satya referenced, we had a good holiday for Xbox. Gaming revenue increased 5% or 9% in constant currency, driven by record Xbox LIVE transactions as well as first-party game releases. \n As expected, hardware revenue decreased due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Segment gross margin declined 1% or increased 5% in constant currency. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily due to reduced expense in our Phone business as well as a successful transition of display advertising sales to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 35%. \n And now back to our overall company results. Customer adoption and usage of our cloud services continues to accelerate globally, and we are investing capital into our data centers and servers to respond to this demand. This quarter, we invested $2 billion, up sequentially from the $1.5 billion invested last quarter. \n Other income was negative $171 million due to interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividend and interest income and net recognized gains on investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations, with the year-over-year decrease primarily due to an IRS audit adjustment in the prior year and lower nondeductible operating losses in the current. This quarter, we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders, an increase of 42%. \n Let's move to the outlook. I want to preface my remarks with 3 overall comments and then move to more specific comments by segment. First, FX. I previously stated that we expected the FX impact on total revenue to be about 3 points in H2. For Q3, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect an overall impact of 4 points. \n By segment, we expect 5 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 4 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. And we anticipate continued lessening of FX impacts by segment and on total revenue in Q4, assuming current rates stay stable. \n Second, our Commercial business. We expect our Commercial business to remain healthy, with ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services. Therefore, even with continuing currency headwinds, we expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $18.8 billion to $19 billion. \n Our Commercial Cloud run rate trajectory remains on path, with continued focus on gross margin improvement across each of our key services. Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online -- though the total commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be impacted by the mix of revenue. \n Third, we will continue to meet global customer demand for cloud services and will increase our investment in data centers and capital equipment in the second half of our fiscal year. \n Now let me share some additional commentary on each segment. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, which reflects 5 points of negative FX impact. This represents 6% year-over-year growth in constant currency, driven by Office 365 momentum and Dynamics Online. \n For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, which reflects 4 points of negative FX impact. Continued customer preference for our hybrid solutions will drive sustained growth in server products and cloud services and robust demand for Enterprise services. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits as it has throughout the first half of our fiscal year. \n For More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion, which includes 3 points of negative FX impact. As this segment has both devices and software, I'll provide a bit more detail. \n First, Windows. As I mentioned earlier, we will return to normal levels of Pro inventory in Q3, and we expect non-Pro revenue to align more closely with the consumer PC market. In Search, Bing will continue to gain share and will remain profitable. For Phone, we expect similar year-over-year revenue declines and the gross margin percentage for Q3 to look similar to Q2. \n After a solid launch quarter with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, we anticipate continued momentum and growth, with Surface Book expanding into additional countries. And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday seasonality. \n We expect COGS to be $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. And for the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion as we continue to improve efficiencies and invest in key growth opportunities. We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q3. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense, offset by dividend interest income. We expect our Q3 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.\n In closing, our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook demonstrate our execution discipline and our investment in strategic areas to sustain long-term growth. We remain focused as we both create new markets and take share in existing ones. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A. \nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. \nPhilip Winslow: I just wanted to focus in on Commercial Cloud and Azure specifically. I mean, Commercial Cloud, as you mentioned, the run rate was up $9.4 billion. I mean, that's up $1.2 billion quarter-to-quarter, 70% year-over-year. That's higher growth rate than even last quarter, Azure a similar thing, accelerating growth versus even last quarter. A question, Satya and I'll follow up for Amy. So Satya, when you look at the growth rates there in Commercial Cloud and particularly Azure, you talked about new customer wins, but also existing customers transitioning more workloads to Azure. I hope you could give us may be some more color there as far as what you're seeing and kind of how you're thinking about the growth going forward there. And then Amy, based on our calculations, it seems like Azure had a pretty meaningful improvement in just the gross margin year-over-year. I wonder if you could help us with sort of the 2 curves in that business, and sort of where we are in Azure's, call it,  gross margin life cycle, you\u2019ve got the fixed costs and the variable costs and how you're thinking about that. \nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Phil, for the question. The way we think about Cloud is how I described it in my remarks, which is it's the combination of the work we're actually doing in the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and also our hybrid cloud layer, because we don't think, for example, of our servers as a distinct part, but it's, in fact, the edge of our cloud and we're building for that with things like Azure Stack. So we think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future, we speak to more of the real-world needs, I think, of an IT organization or a business organization that's trying to transform through digital technology. I mean, if you put yourselves as a CIO of an organization -- in a multinational organization, and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty, and then you want to be able to take some workloads, move them all to the cloud, some you want to be able to tier with the cloud. That's the kind of flexibility we provide. And we also see network effects between -- if you're using Office 365, you want to extend the data in Office 365 by building applications that join it with some other data inside of our Data Lake service in Azure. Obviously, Azure becomes a natural choice for such application development, and we're increasingly seeing that. So that's really our strategy. Our strategy is not to compete in these constituent parts independently with different competitors. It is to bring one architecture and really drive the value for our customers because of that. \nAmy Hood: And Phil, let me quickly cover, I think, your gross margin question. You're right. We did actually make significant progress in both Azure as well as Office 365. And then the mix of those obviously impacts the overall commercial cloud gross margin. What's important, the dynamic's actually quite similar even though the services are quite different. There are really 2 fundamental components to gross margin improvement. Number one is obviously scale efficiencies and where we are in that curve, which we are doing and continue to make consistent improvement in. The next obviously is the mix of premium services. And Satya talked about some of the increasing mix of premium services in Azure. That's been encouraging, especially in existing customers over time and through adoption curves. And Office 365, as you know, we continue to be excited by our premium mix in the Commercial segment. So those 2 combinations each quarter impact it as well as the overall. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. \nKeith Weiss: Satya, you mentioned a -- both new and existing customers increasingly using the Azure Cloud. I was hoping you could give us some color into what that looks like, specifically when an existing customer starts using Azure in terms of how does their overall spending get impacted? And what happens to sort of their spending for the more traditional server and tools? How does that get impacted as people use the public cloud utility more and more? \nSatya Nadella: Yes, I mean, the thing that we sort of notice is that with anyone who's moved to the cloud, there is a real opportunity for us to expand to multiple workloads over time because it's a design win. It's like essentially an ISV win in the client/server area, where you could get someone to build on your core infrastructure, they build their first application, and it turns out that once you've done that, you would want to look at our infrastructure for a second workload and third workload. So that's one side of what's happening with the expansion. The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you're an Office 365 customer, you have data in Office 365. You want to build applications that tap into that data, then you use Azure. So that's the other piece. The EMS growth is also very much related to that, which is if you deploy Exchange Online, you have Azure AD and then the natural expansion from there is the full EMS suite with device management for all your mobile devices and also Advanced Threat Protection and what have you. So we see those -- both those trends of -- from an application workload development synergy as well as infrastructure from identity management, device management workout. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. \nBrent Thill: Amy, macro is on everyone's mind. I'm just curious if you guys could comment a little bit about what you're seeing. I know it may be too early to see some of the weakness that others have seen. But how are you looking at the demand environment? And how does that change your plans as you look towards the back half of the year? Just any assumptions change in your mind? \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent, for the question. The geos I specifically called out obviously, are where we are the most impacted and they are the bigger geos. But really I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be, focus on our own execution, focus on continuing to drive cloud services, focus on continuing to drive annuity mix. Those movements actually, and as we help customers transform, is really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you're clearly asking me about. But I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. \nHeather Bellini: I was just wondering, Satya, you mentioned, and I know there's been a lot of questions on Azure. But you mentioned strong growth in compute and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5x. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads. I mean, is it right now more new workload growth and there's -- it's very little existing workloads moving over. I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. And I'm also wondering if you see it helping with share. You mentioned it's kind of like a design win or an ISV win. Wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus say Linux or versus other types of infrastructure platforms. \nSatya Nadella: Yes. The thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before. In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as Intelligent Cloud, we are operating in a much bigger market. And that's because, first of all, the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories, as well as take something that you mentioned, which is Linux. We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20-plus percent of Azure is Linux workloads, which is sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud, which we didn't have previously. And even take something like EMS, which is a service, you could say in the past, we participated with Active Directory. But we -- and some amount of System Center. But now, with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications, our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client/server era. So clearly, we are migrating some workloads, and structurally, some of that helps us because we had that position in the client/server space. But when we look at what we are doing in the cloud, it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications. So those are all things that we participate in, which we didn't participate in the past. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. \nMark Moerdler: So I got a question for Satya and then a quick follow-up for Amy. Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PaaS, Infrastructure as a Service, hybrid are all related, but as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PaaS versus Infrastructure as a Service? PaaS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity big, bigger? How should we think about that? And then I have a follow-up for Amy. \nSatya Nadella: The opportunity, I believe, in both cases is high because it just comes in different forms. IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. So I think that depending on what -- if you're bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PaaS will grow. If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine. So I, myself, in fact, one of the things that Amy and I do is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. In fact, we amortize our CapEx across all of these, and we pay attention to margin and premium mix because what we have come to understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start, have different mix profiles. So it's the all-up as long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remains strong. We feel that the mix can be different and it's okay. And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have. \nMark Moerdler: Perfect. Amy, a slightly different topic. Free cash flow grew 25% year-on-year, much faster than the other metrics. How should we think about this trend continuing? \nAmy Hood: That was impacted, Mark, in the prior year by some integration and restructuring charges on the cash flow statement. \nMark Moerdler: Okay. So it's really a onetime event more than anything else? \nSatya Nadella: Yes, just always make sure you check the integration and restructuring in the prior year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. \nRaimo Lenschow: Quick question for Satya. Now that Windows 10 is on 200 million devices, what do you see on the developer network because one of the big aims was you have a uniform platform for developers to go against the PC, tablet, et cetera. What do you see in terms of them kind of starting to embrace the platform and use the opportunity there? \nSatya Nadella: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, you're absolutely right. That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with store integrated into the install base and in the user experience so that we could increase the success for developers. And we're seeing good early signs. In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers, like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others. And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1, and of course, now with Xbox as well, which has got great attraction to gaming developers. And so those are the natural places, where you will see us gain more developers and gain more traction. We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified store. And then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. \nWalter Pritchard: Just a numbers question for Amy. I noticed your long-term unearned revenue was up quite a bit. I mean, that's kind of been a flattish trend, and it was paired with commercial bookings being much stronger, I think, than I was modeling. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand what drove the unearned and how that contributed to those commercial bookings. \nAmy Hood: Sure. A couple of things, Walter, which I know you recall. We do have a bit of lumpiness in our explorations, as I said on the call. This was a big exploration quarter for us. And so on occasion what that does even with the negative currency impact on C&B is have a bit of lumpiness over time. Now that being said, I want to point to the core, which is that renewal rates were very good in a big quarter. There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong. \nWalter Pritchard: And then if I can just -- one other numbers question. It looks like in the Q, you called out actually Windows Server declining as an offset to Intelligent Cloud growth. And I'm wondering we haven't seen that comment in the Q before. Was there something sort of one-off driving that or any further detail on that? \nAmy Hood: The way I would think about that one, Walter, is, in general, our premium or enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, System Center, et cetera, grew double digits. And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads. And that is where macro pressure on occasion shows itself first is in some of that non-annuity lumpiness. So that's the nature of that comment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. \nKarl Keirstead: Amy, relative to your 2Q guide, the upside surprise really came in the personal computing business. And at least relative to our third quarter estimates, it's again the personal computing guidance that beat. I'm wondering if you could repeat the key factors that are contributing to the outperformance in that pretty important business. \nAmy Hood: Sure, Karl. In Q2 -- let me talk about 2 key ones. Number one is really the device launches. We actually launched a very broad portfolio of devices into the quarter, with Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. And so between all of those hardware products as well as our gaming performance, and other sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. Now when you launch mid-quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that. But I feel very good about the execution of those, and that is a meaningful component of that outperformance. The second one, which I talked about, is OEM Pro. We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. I expect to work through that in Q2 -- I mean, Q3. And that was a couple of points of impact, for example, on OEM Pro in quarter. \nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. And then, Amy, for the third quarter, your guide for that business is also pretty good. Is that due to some of these similar factors? Or are there 1 or 2 others that are driving the -- what appears to be pretty solid 3Q performance in that unit as well? \nAmy Hood: Well, it's similar drivers. In that segment, there's also some topics I tend to not get asked about in Q&A. Let me take the opportunity to talk about them, which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. Frankly, our display business has been quite good. And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially. I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos. And so if you think about all those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength. You see them again in Q3. And so I'm not sure there's anything \"new\", Karl, I would say other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. \nKash Rangan: I was curious to get your thoughts, Satya, on the Windows 10 upgrade cycle in the enterprise, and also the consumer market, particularly after you've anniversaried the free offer for Windows 10. And secondly and finally, thoughts on Surface. It's off to a great start with the latest model. Could that play a more important role in the corporate computing landscape? \nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Kash, for the question. I thought the upgrade momentum, the fact will we crossed 200 million active devices, we feel very, very good about that. And the pilot, the most -- the place, which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us, is the enterprise deployment. And that's where I think there's real excitement because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability that I think is going to create great value for enterprises and that's showing up in all the pilots. And the accelerate -- I've never seen a Windows release in the enterprise with this level of accelerated deployments -- deployment plan. So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we are focused on it. As far as Surface, Surface is playing an increasing role for us in both consumer as well as in the enterprise market. And also, we just -- we created a new category of 2-in-1s, where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface. And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth. \nAmy Hood: I would just add one thing is that we've actually announced a number of important partners to help us take the Surface portfolio into commercial customers. I think we'll expect to see progress on that over the course of the year. \nKash Rangan: If I could, your excitement is pretty palpable. What could be driving that 140% increase in adoption relative to Windows 10. We all thought XP to 7 was a major transition, but it looks like there's another big transition happening here. \nSatya Nadella: I mean, I think there are 2 aspects of it. We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user. And second, I believe, is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement with the browser or things like Xbox LIVE, with the store or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios. So I think it's the combination of all of that. But it starts with having a good product truth which Windows 10 does deliver on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. \nRoss MacMillan: Satya, I had a question on commercial Office 365. I don't know if you gave us the number, but I think the last couple of quarters, you talked about monthly active users, and I'm curious if you have an update on that number. And then I also was curious about thoughts around ARPU because you introduced the E5 SKU in December. Where are we on the path of penetration, if you will, with the higher value SKUs and the ability to see price lift across the base over time? \nSatya Nadella: Yes, I'll start and Amy, you can add. I mean, I think that's right. Last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. In fact, there is always, I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then -\u2013 or subscriptions sold, and then there's deployment and there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate. And we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. But I feel very, very good in the growth of that. And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, because if you look at what we do is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure and you see that increasing. And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean, the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that's the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products in Office 365 that's most evident with E3 and now E5. Even in Azure, we have things like EMS. We have our data services, even our developer services. So I think all of -- both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on, and we see in our results. \nAmy Hood: That's right. I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up at Office 365 on the commercial side as you were noting. And really E5 has only been in market for the last month of the quarter. We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers, but I would expect that to sort of be a longer-term evolution as opposed to in Q2. \nRoss MacMillan: Can I just a quick follow-up? Amy, that was great. Just on Windows just so we all calibrate correctly. You've had this benefit from the RPL comps from last year. Should we think about Windows really now beginning to trend in line to PC units? Or can there still be some variability around that? \nAmy Hood: Yes. In my guidance comments, I talked a little bit about that. On the Pro side, as I mentioned, we'll have a couple of point impact that will make a difference between that on the Pro side. And I would expect -- I think we actually even talked about that last quarter that the RPL delta, which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market. \nOperator: And our last question will come from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. \nEdward Maguire: I wanted to ask if you've been able to quantify some of the uplift since you've been opening up Office to different platforms like iOS and Android, and now with the recent alliance with Red Hat, opening up a lot of opportunity to Linux developers. Have you been able to quantify how much uplift you've gotten and how do you see this impacting your broader market opportunity? \nSatya Nadella: Let me sort of speak to it in generic terms because I don't think we have sort of quantified it as narrowly perhaps just to address those specific moves we made. But overall the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers is valuable across all of their devices because it speaks to the vision that we have, which is the cloud is what enables the mobility of the human experience across all of the devices in your life, because increasingly, there will be more devices. And we want to make sure that we are adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription. So that's been our goal, and that's working well and it sort of shows up in our all-up growth. And similarly with Azure, we are making sure that as people are tapping into the cloud and moving to the cloud, we can get all workloads to be as first class as on Azure so that's why we've done the deals with Red Hat. We even did previously deals with Oracle. So Azure is a complete open platform where, of course, you can run all the Windows workloads, the .Net workloads, but we are increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you and more interestingly the mix of all of them because it's -- the enterprise is heterogeneous, it has been heterogeneous. We participated only in a portion of it. Whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. And that's how we thought about it, and that's what we're executing on. \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Ed, and thanks, everybody. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you very much. \nChris Suh: So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast, and you can follow the comments at microsoft.com/investor. Please contact us if you need any additional details, and thank you again for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 1, "year": 2016, "date": "2015-10-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.\nChris Suh: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our website also includes information related to our new financial reporting segments announced in September. This is also the first quarter that reflects the revenue recognition accounting for Windows 10. As a reminder, we report Windows revenue prior to any accounting adjustment in our More Personal Computing segment. The corresponding revenue deferral for Windows 10 sales is then reported in corporate and other in our segment reporting. Earnings commentary today and going forward will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact as we believe this is the best reflection of business health. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges and the current Windows 10 net revenue deferral. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges. All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to the recent change in our segment reporting groupings we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and income growth at the company-wide level. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission and in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 21, 2016. During this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm looking forward to today's call. This quarter we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue and group profit. Also as part of our commitment to balance capital returns, we meaningfully increased our quarterly dividend and continued our stock repurchase plan. More importantly, we are focused and making progress towards the goals for fiscal year 2018 that we shared six months ago. Now more than 110 million active devices are running Windows 10. We are well on our way to reaching 1 billion Windows 10 active devices. People are moving from needing to choosing to loving Windows. Similarly we are making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion. The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity and the speed at which customers are adopting our service. As I reflect on the quarter, it is important to note that we are investing in significant addressable markets where we also have meaningful differentiation. Today we'll walk through our financial results for the first quarter and discuss how we are delivering new innovation and growing users and usage across each of our three segments. Let's start off with productivity and business process. Clearly, how people work has changed dramatically but one thing remains true, everyone wants to get more out of every moment of their life. After all, time is our scarcest commodity. That's why we set out to reinvent productivity and business process. The recent release of Office is a big step forward. We designed Office 2016 and Office 365 to take the work out of working together. We want to help change the nature of work within organizations of all sizes by focusing on the mobility of the person's experience, enabling collaboration and building a rich service that spans all aspects of how people work today. This approach is resonating with both our consumer and commercial customers. More and more consumers are using Office across device platforms, which is driving Office 365 growth. There are now more than 18 million consumer Office 365 subscribers. We surpassed 200 million downloads of Office Mobile, more than 1 billion to-do lists have been created so far in Wunderlist and more than 0.5 billion people manage their documents and photos in OneDrive. We continue to see strong adoption in the commercial space as well. From our largest customers, such as Kraft, GE, Louis Vuitton, to schools and small businesses around the globe. Of note, commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million with nearly 60% of our installed base using premium workloads. And we added 50,000 new small business customers in each of the last 19 consecutive months. As customers move to our cloud, it enables us to deliver even more value and push for new growth by entering new categories. Information protection is a great example where we have done this because of natural synergies with our existing services. In fact, nearly 20 million people already use our new premium information protection capabilities in Office 365. That's a tremendous validation of how the cloud accelerates the adoption of new workloads and grows our ability to monetize new value in the $10 billion information protection market. The new organizational analytics market is another area where we see growth opportunity so we are investing with our acquisition of VoloMetrix, a powerful cloud-based tool for analyzing organizational productivity. The ability to visualize how people engage with others inside and outside an organization is something the cloud is uniquely suited to do. It is exciting to be on the forefront of creating a new technology category. This illustrates how our vision for productivity goes beyond helping individuals to empowering groups of people and entire organizations to accomplish more together. Our addressable opportunity will expand further as we launch more advanced security, voice and analytics workloads in our new premium Office 365 SKU next quarter. Let's talk about business process. With Dynamics we are making great progress in breaking down the boundaries between business process, collaboration and productivity to truly empower organizations. The companies I talk with every day are under pressure to grow revenue while differentiating themselves on customer experience. It's one reason usage of CRM is growing. Dynamics CRM Online enterprise seats more than tripled year over year. Dynamics AX revenue also grew double digits as the operational system for agile business processes. And we have a new release for Dynamics NAV for small businesses that is tightly integrated with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM. Moving to the intelligent cloud. Before I talk about the great progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform, I want to pause and reflect on where we are as an industry. While many companies are developing commercial cloud offerings, there are really only two driving enterprise cloud platform innovations at massive scale, Amazon and Microsoft. We push each other and we each have a unique approach. Microsoft has bet on a strategy to build a hyper-scale public cloud as well as reinvent servers as the edge of our cloud. This approach gives customers a true hybrid distributed computing platform that reflects their real world needs. Our unique hybrid approach coupled with high value services is clearly a structural advantage. It's great to see our customers like Walmart, jet.com and Alaska Airlines seize the benefits of the cloud to transform and push for growth. Azure revenue and compute usage more than doubled year over year and we are continuing to channel our innovation into high growth scenarios with new features and services. In the last quarter alone, we have made major updates spanning Azure app services for building enterprise web and mobile apps, Azure Data Lake for infinite data management and analytics, advanced threat analytics which help organizations identify breaches and threats using behavioral analysis. CIOs are increasingly adopting our Azure premium service for security and manageability. Enterprise Mobility services has more than doubled to 20,000-plus customers. Our installed base has increased nearly 6 times year over year making EMS the largest mobility and identity management solution in a new and growing market. Our acquisition of Adallom, an innovator in cloud security, will bring customers with ability and control over application access and company data stored across popular cloud applications including Office 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow and many more. To be a worldwide cloud player, global scale is a must. With that in mind, we launched new data centers in India bringing our global total to over 20 regions, more than any other major cloud provider. We aren't just selling into these countries, we see the cloud as an accelerator of local economies by offering tools that empower emerging businesses, transform public sector services and create value for new local partners. Our differentiated hybrid capabilities mean customers get to choose how they adopt the cloud and distribute their workloads. This in turn is driving the growth of our server business. Premium versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center all grew double digits. Lastly, we reached a big milestone with SQL Server, one that has been 20 years in the making. The database software market is still one of the largest and now we are an unparalleled leader in Gartner's Operational DBMS Magic Quadrant. That speaks to our differentiated vision in the category and the value we deliver to customers and we are certainly not done innovating. This milestone with SQL juxtaposed with our rapid growth in Azure and its position in the cloud Magic Quadrant shows the overall strength and progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform. Now let's shift to progress in our More Personal Computing segment, specifically how the launch of Windows 10 is sparking new growth opportunities for the entire Windows ecosystem. As a platform company, we think about bringing the needs of multiple constituencies together, developers, IT professionals and users, and we have seen great response from all three. There are now more than 110 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The majority of the upgrades in the first 10 weeks were naturally from consumers and are three times that of Windows 7 over the same time period after launch. We are also seeing a fast start to business adoption with more than 8 million business PCs now running Windows 10. We are adding more enterprise features and we are making it easier for businesses to buy and support Windows devices. Our early success in attracting developers' apps and store visits is also growing. Our stores have seen 1.25 billion visits and developer revenue per download has grown four times since the Windows 10 launch. Developers are responding to the opportunity, including Facebook, which will release universal apps for Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Windows 10 is also driving increased usage of other Microsoft services. Specifically, Bing's share is up to 20.7% in the US and advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide, helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions. Further in gaming, we have also seen an increase in active users as we extend our gaming experiences from the console to Windows 10 PCs. Xbox Live continues to grow active usage and every day nearly half of the Xbox One user base is engaged in the service. It'll be a great holiday for all gamers. The beta release of Minecraft for Windows 10 is off to a strong start, with players having already placed over 0.5 billion blocks. And next week we are excited to launch one of the most anticipated new games this holiday with Halo 5: Guardians. This new Halo includes an epic hunt for Master Chief along with groundbreaking multiplayer matches on Xbox Live. As a result, I confidently predict that time will become much more scarce for Xbox One owners starting on Tuesday. We see all of this Windows 10 usage as an early indicator of our ability to drive growth over the lifetime of a device. Two weeks ago we took the next major step in our journey with announcement of new Windows 10 premium devices from us and from our OEM partners. It's an incredible lineup across a broad spectrum of categories from the new Surface Pro 4, Surface Book to Lumia 950, 950 XL, to Microsoft Band 2 and HoloLens developer edition. Early reviews are generating excitement with customers and we are delighted that our preorder sales are reflecting the positive sentiment in the market. We're also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners, the widest range ever for this holiday. It's clear that by bringing together our applications, operating system and hardware, we will invent new personal computers and new personal computing. Overall, I'm proud of our results this quarter and I'm optimistic about our growth prospects. We are poised to seize the opportunity of the largest technology shift of our generation with the enterprise cloud. We are increasing users and engagement in services that cross every aspect of a person's life, from Office at work to Xbox at home, while at the same time we are positioning Windows for growth. Our transformation is well underway. Quarter after quarter we build new capability, we enter new markets, scale our new businesses and new business models and we are being disciplined in our execution. I'll now handed off to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in greater detail and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.\nAmy E. Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Before addressing this quarter's results, I want to briefly comment on the reporting segment change we announced during the quarter. We believe our new segments in combination with the supplemental metrics and the profit measure of operating incomes provide transparency into our progress against our ambitions. As Chris mentioned, my commentary today on our results and outlook will reflect the new segments and excludes the net revenue deferral impact of Windows 10. Last quarter, we discussed the material impact that foreign exchange movement would have on our financial results through fiscal 2016. In Q1, the FX impact on total revenue was 5 points, with most of the impact in the Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments given their high annuity mix. This was in line with the expectations we shared in July. This quarter, revenue was $21.7 billion, down 7% and 2% in constant currency, primarily due to the changes we've made in our phone business. Gross margin declined by 3% but was up 3% in constant currency. We were thoughtful with operating expenses, realizing savings but investing as well. As a result, operating income grew 1% or 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.67 growing 3% and growing 15% in constant currency. We continued to see solid performance across most developed markets while the challenging macro conditions in Brazil, China, Japan, and Russia persisted this quarter. Commercial results are now included in each of the reporting segments, therefore each quarter I will cover overall commercial results in my commentary. Our commercial business continues to be healthy, with momentum in cloud services and a higher annuity mix across all segments. Commercial bookings were slightly better than we expected and grew 10% in constant currency. We executed well on expirations and commercial unearned revenue came in as expected, growing 3% to $21 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance was more than $23.5 billion, in line with seasonality for the quarter. As Satya remarked, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $8.2 billion, growing nearly 70% year on year and in line with our expectations. Consistent with the revenue pattern across our commercial business, we typically derived the largest volume of renewals and new agreements in June and consequently see a lower sequential growth rate in Q1. Importantly, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage improved again sequentially from Q4 as we benefited from increasing scale and efficiencies. As I will talk about shortly, our leading indicators around usage, new cloud services and customer demand remain healthy, and we are clearly on track for our $20 billion goal in FY 2018. Now, let's turn to the detailed results of each segment. Our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is made up of commercial and consumer Office including Office 365 as well as Dynamics delivered $6.3 billion in revenue, declining 3% and growing 4% in constant currency. In Office commercial, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was slightly better than we expected. Increased channel sales capacity, a higher adoption of premium services and continued installed base growth all contributed to our performance. We saw broad-based Office 365 seat growth across both large enterprise and the SMB customer base. Office consumer revenue declined 4% in constant currency, better than the underlying consumer PC market and slightly better than we had expected. This quarter, recurring subscription revenue more than offset the impact of customers transitioning to Office 365. Our Dynamics business grew 12% in constant currency, slightly better than we expected. Growth was driven primarily by Dynamics CRM Online. We continue to make progress by investing in product innovation organically as well as adding capabilities through acquisitions like FieldOne and FantasySalesTeam. Segment gross margin declined 6% but grew 1% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages have been impacted by the mix shift toward our rapidly growing cloud services, including our consumer properties like OneDrive. As Chris mentioned, this year we can't provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore operating income. That said, FX in general as at the company level had a favorable impact on operating expenses, which declined 6%. The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes our portfolio of server products, Azure cloud services and Enterprise services, delivered $5.9 billion of revenue, up 8% and up 14% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Our differentiated cloud platform offerings and rapid pace of innovation continue to be compelling to both new and existing customers. Segment gross margin grew 8% or 15% in constant currency. We continue to invest in research and development resources to realize the large and growing addressable market opportunities and are accelerating our plans to add incremental sales capacity to support growing customer demand for cloud services. Segment operating income grew 14%. Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search. Revenue was $9.4 billion, declining 17% and 13% in constant currency, mainly due to the changes in our phone strategy. As Satya mentioned, since the launch of Windows 10 in late July, we have seen solid momentum in our ecosystem and with our customers. And importantly, we saw positive engagement and usage signals across services like search and gaming that provide post-sale monetization opportunities. Overall, our OEM business declined 6% this quarter, outperforming the PC market and better than we had anticipated, driven primarily by non-Pro OEM. As we discussed previously, this was a transition quarter as the ecosystem moves to Windows 10 and we believe overall inventory in the channel is at normal levels as we head into holiday. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 4% as we saw OEMs focused on premium devices aligned to the Windows 10 launch. This drove a richer mix to market leading to improvement in the average revenue per license. OEM Pro revenue declined 7% slightly ahead of the overall commercial PC market. Windows volume licensing grew 4% in constant currency with annuity growth in mid single digits. Search revenue increased to more than $1 billion this quarter and we passed an important milestone as our search business reached profitability. In our devices portfolio, revenue declined 49% and 45% in constant currency, mainly due to phone revenue which decreased $1.5 billion. As expected, Surface revenue slowed with the market anticipation of a new Surface Pro device for the holidays. Surface continues to gain ground with businesses and schools, creating opportunities for our rapidly growing partner channel which includes Accenture, Dell and HP. Both the number and size of deals in our commercial segment for Surface have increased double digits year on year. This quarter in gaming, revenue grew 6% in constant currency. We saw growth in Xbox Live transactional revenue and our first-party game portfolio, offset by declines in hardware revenue due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Government gross margin declined 10% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat year over year, excluding the phone. Segment operating expenses declined 13% due primarily to lower phone expense. As a result, segment operating income decreased 4%. Now back to our overall company results. As usage of our cloud service grows, we will continue to invest capital into our data centers and servers globally. This quarter we invested $1.5 billion to support that demand-driven growth. Other income was negative $280 million due in part to foreign currency remeasurement and interest expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21%, below our guided range. This was driven by the change in geographic mix of our earnings and lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone. This quarter, we returned $6.9 billion to shareholders, up 51%. This includes our recently announced 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36. With that overview of the quarter, let's move to the outlook. I'll start with some overall comments and then move to a discussion by segment. First on FX. Based on the current rates and the forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 4 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q2. By segment, we expect a 7 point drag in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. In H2, we expect the impact to lessen to around 3 points in total, weighted toward our segments with the highest percentage of annuity. Next to our commercial business, which we expect to remain healthy in Q2. Our annuity mix should trend up with good execution on contract renewals and continued adoption of our commercial cloud services. Accordingly, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within a range of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, benefiting from these positive trends. With the ongoing increase in cloud demand, we expect to accelerate our investment in data centers and capital equipment for the remainder of the fiscal year, expanding geographic coverage and capacity. Now let me share some additional thoughts on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion. Adjusted for 7 points of expected FX impact, the revenue growth reflects the continued momentum of Office 365 and our Dynamics portfolio. And as Satya discussed, with our new E5 SKU in Q2, we're expanding our opportunity into security, analytics and voice. For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion, including a 6 point FX impact. Our hybrid approach continues to drive growth in our server licensing business and robust growth in our services. Gross margin in this segment will reflect the accelerating mix of cloud services. We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $12 billion to $12.4 billion, including the 3 points of FX impact. Because of the mix of devices and software in this segment, let me provide a bit more context. First on Windows. Overall in Q2, we expect our OEM business to look similar to Q1 with non-Pro outperforming the underlying PC market. As we move deeper through the fiscal year, the device mix should evolve as our OEM partners produce more models at a wider range of price points. In search, we expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the year. We will continue to see the impact of the phone restructuring. Revenue declines and gross margin percentages in Q2 should look similar to Q1. And with the strong holiday Surface lineup, we expect revenue to grow in Q2. Gross margins will reflect the mix of device life cycles between Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and a growing mix of Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by the device sales. We expect operating expenses between $8 billion and $8.1 billion in Q2. For the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.9 billion to $32.1 billion. We are and will continue to thoughtfully reinvest operating expense savings to accelerate growth in key areas, to expand our addressable market and transform how we work, to better deliver products and services to our customers. We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q2, similar to Q1. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend and interest income. We expect our Q2 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Similar to Q1, this reflects the changing geographic mix of revenue as well as lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone. In closing, during Q1 we exceeded our own expectations across many of our businesses and more importantly, we saw healthy indicators of future growth. Through business model transitions and strategic shifts, our solid execution paired with a focus on achieving our bold ambitions has enabled us to take share in existing areas while we enter new ones. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Eric Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter indeed. I wanted to ask about the Azure in particular and the public cloud performance that you saw this quarter. It again seems like you're seeing an acceleration in that overall business and more broadly it seems like industry-wide both you guys and AWS are seeing something of an inflection point going on in terms of more and more business accruing to those public cloud environments. So my question is just that, would you agree with that statement that there is an inflection going on in the business? And if so, what do you think is causing that and is there a changing nature in how people are using that cloud? And then maybe for Amy, is there something we should bear in mind in terms of your traditional business, sort of the on-premise business that may be impacted as that inflection takes place that we should bear in mind as you go forward?\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, I'll start, Keith, thanks for the question. Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. I grew up in our server business in the past. We were definitely the one to democratize servers by bringing servers to small businesses. But when I think about what's happening for example in Office 365, where we are adding 50,000 small business customers who now get the most sophisticated server technology, but now as a SaaS service, that's what's really happening world over with all application categories and that's where the growth is. I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. And in our case the vision also we have for distributed cloud infrastructure is just that, it is distributed. So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. I think of it as the edge of our cloud. If you look at what we are doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. Those are the kinds of things that we are excited about. But we clearly are seeing very rapid growth and adoption of our Azure cloud. But in our case there are two unique aspects. One is this true distributed hybrid. And second is we don't think of Azure in isolation. We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics, EMS, because really it's one cloud infrastructure first of all from a capital perspective that sort of serves all of these and there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well.\nAmy E. Hood: And Keith, your second question, the place you'll actually see it will be in the gross margin percentage. As Satya said, I do expect both to grow, both the on-premise and the cloud. But I expect the mix to increasingly shift toward the cloud given its sort of robust growth rate, which will impact the gross margin percentage over time.\nKeith Eric Weiss: Excellent. That's very helpful, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark L. Moerdler: Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter everyone. Two questions, but related. Let me give you the first one. The commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate grew slightly from $8 billion to $8.2 billion or a little more than each of those. You had Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and all of them seem to be growing very fast. How should we think about the difference? Should we figure that the run rate reaccelerates next year? Next quarter, excuse me. And then I have a follow-up.\nAmy E. Hood: The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. For me that is more symbolic of how you should think about the pace. And that is a very fast number on a increasingly growing base.\nMark L. Moerdler: That makes perfect sense. Thank you. The second one is the cloud margins improved nicely. Given the data that's in here, it looks like they've all started to move up. Azure seems to move up. You'd said in the FAM the gross margins for 2015 (37:31) should be about 44%. How should we think about cloud gross margins for 2015? I know you don't know obviously the mix of all the cloud products, but how should we think about the improvement there?\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks, Mark. Looking in the old segments, I know you all have done, we saw a year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year over year. We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. And if you think about our launch of E5, which is a premium SKU in Office 365, it continues to give us the opportunity to both get more efficient in the infrastructure and to add higher margin products especially at the fast end.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, just one thing that's structurally I think, that we think a lot about and we're very disciplined about is our capital allows us to build all of the cloud services from Office 365 to EMS to Dynamics to Azure. And that diversity of workloads long term is what lead to margin improvement. And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us.\nMark L. Moerdler: Beautiful. It's great to see that improvement happening. Thank you very much.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Mark. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. Just a question for Satya then a follow-up to Amy. Satya, you talked about your good adoption of Office 365 on the commercial side both in SMBs and large enterprise. I wonder if you could just break that down and where you're seeing the faster adoption as you start to get into the enterprises, especially that might have enterprise agreements with Microsoft. How is that sales motion going and what is the pitch there? And then to Amy, I thought this was a key point, something that we've been looking for. You noted that the subscriptions recurring business now has offset the cannibalization on the license. Is that something that we should think about going forward or was there something specific about this quarter that would push that out? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah first, as far as the Office 365 usage itself, I talked about some of the numbers of 60 million monthly active users, the fact that our seats grew 66% year over year. The small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. These are all the growth numbers and the usage growth numbers. The mix even, that information protection, I mean that's just another very important point which is amongst the customers who are using Office 365, already 20 million are using some of these premium services like information protection. And of course we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365. So I see that stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end. And we see nice attach as far as EAs to the cloud as well and that's definitely a big driver of our growth.\nAmy E. Hood: And so let me take the second and I'll add something to what Satya said. One of the important things that's distinct about the small business market is that there tends not to be much of a lag in terms of buying and deployment. They want to be able to instantaneously use and get value very quickly and that's something we've actually seen and a real testament to our ability to add so many customers in every quarter. And what you've seen in consumer side, which it was an important point. Once we've built this installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does in fact offset the deferral from new, and so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter. Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thanks guys and congrats.\nChris Suh: Thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Anne Bellini: Great, thank you. I just had two quick questions. I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for just a high level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure and maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving. And then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10. You gave the Bing example for the month of September and the solid pull forward there, or pull along there. I'm just wondering if you could share with us any other areas where you're seeing a similar kind of pull along with Windows 10 adoption. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Sure, Heather. On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services. I mean to put it very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory. That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. It could be as someone coming from Office 365. It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS. All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory which is our largest PaaS service because it's got even developer API, so that means more developers are using it. More IT professionals are using it as the control plane. So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. We see a lot of growth there. We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services. Hadoop is another good example. We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth. So I would say there is a real good mix of those two. And then on Windows 10, I mean I'm very, very excited obviously about what's happening with Bing. I think Amy talked about we have a $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States. That's fantastic to see. But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox Live now that spans both console and PC. We see increased engagement because of that. We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft. So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed\nBrent John Thill: Good afternoon. Satya, Michael Dell mentioned with you on stage a week ago that he's seen from his perspective stronger Windows 10 adoption among enterprise customers faster than he had seen in the past. And I'm curious if you're starting to see a halo impact where those that are looking to move up are saying we want to go with more of the complete infrastructure set? And are you seeing different sales motions among those enterprise customers as those customers are coming back to you?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Brent. I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise. We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. But to your point, the fact that there is pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7. And so to me that's all positive news, and but yet we're very, very focused on delivering I think new value to the enterprise customers. Because if you look at Windows 10 we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value. But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle.\nBrent John Thill: Real quick just for Amy on cash flow, is there anything that we should take into account this year versus what happened last year?\nAmy E. Hood: I don't think anything unique that I would bring up, no.\nBrent John Thill: Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks, Brent.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Beside Azure in the intelligent cloud, you obviously have very, very good momentum on the classic server and tools business. Can you talk a little bit about the volume versus price effect that you see playing out here and how is it now and how do you expect that to play out going forward? And one of the things on Azure was usage, and you mentioned how that kind of improved quite significantly. Satya, can you talk a little bit where you see that current usage standing and where do you think that can go? We obviously didn't get a number, just a growth rate. But where do you see usage? Because that's obviously one of the things that one of your competitors keeps talking, trying knock on you. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, I mean I think the usage number is the one that, Raimo, that we talked about, which is doubling of compute, doubling of storage. We talked about the growth of our EMS, which is a higher level service. We talked about the growth in Active Directory. So we have usage growth in Azure which is very, very healthy.\nAmy E. Hood: And on the server question you asked at the beginning, let me say that we did see I think around 9% constant currency growth of the core server product, and a lot of that was premium driven. Now, I have a distinction between a price question that you sort of asked versus seeing the value of a premium SKU. And so I do think it was premium driven as opposed to sort of a price driven in particular.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. That's helpful thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Raimo. Next question please\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl E. Keirstead: Thanks very much. I wouldn't mind going back to Windows 10. Three months ago on the June quarter call, the messaging was that Windows 10 would not likely lift Microsoft's performance results until the second half of fiscal 2016. Yet it feels like as early as this first quarter, it's creating a lift at least to the Windows OEM business. And I just wanted to understand what's changed in the last three months such that it's having an earlier than expected positive impact on Microsoft. Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks, Karl. Why don't I take that and Satya can add. In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction. And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance. And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business. But really some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought. Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded. And so I do think we are encouraged, as Satya said. But we're a quarter in. And I think what's exciting for us is really the opportunity we have going forward. We're excited about Q2 when the devices hit the shelves. We're excited to have so many first party devices in Q2. And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Karl.\nKarl E. Keirstead: Okay. Thank you, Amy.\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks.\nChris Suh: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Hi. Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about on the computing side, the personal computing side, you talked about this quarter seeing growth ahead of the PC market. You alluded to a diversity of devices coming in the second half. How do you think about that variable in the model say beyond this sort of launch period where you have a little bit of a differing mix going on in devices and you get to more of a steady state out in kind of years two and three of the Windows 10 launch? Do you think you can grow ahead of the PC market? Or do you think \u2013 I know for the last few years you've grown below the PC market. Just wondering how we should think about that.\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks, Walter. Let me talk a little bit about what I said in my outlook. This quarter, as I just talked about, the non-Pro outperformance versus the market was really due to a higher revenue per license. I expect that actually to continue in Q2. I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs. Once we work through sort of the end of XP bump, that really should be in the line. And as we talked about, as we move through the year, I do expect things to more normalize overall in terms of RPL comparisons. But I do think that's probably the best way to think about the curve over the course of the year.\nWalter H. Pritchard: And then on the commercial licensing part, specifically within productivity, I know you sort of had an old breakout and a new breakout where we don't see commercial licensing necessarily within Productivity. But would you expect that piece, the commercial licensing within Productivity given the transition going on to be stable? Or would that decline as you see the transition over to the cloud in Productivity specifically?\nAmy E. Hood: Let me try and if I missed the question or misunderstood it, you can help me again. I think you're asking about our core Office commercial business, the product side versus the service side.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Correct.\nAmy E. Hood: And really, okay good. The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis. That was 70% cloud minus 8% on prem. That's a trend that's not new for us. We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base. So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that. New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side. Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling. And then in terms of renewals, they're quite good, which we talked about. And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. I think what's important is our ability to switch it to the services and add more over time that really I focus on.\nWalter H. Pritchard: Okay. Thank you.\nChris Suh: Great. We'll move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark R. Murphy: Yes, thank you very much. Amy, I see the commercial bookings numbers in the KPI sheet, but I do not see the total bookings numbers. I'm wondering if you could just comment on that so that we can try to maintain a consistent analysis there if it's relevant. And also, Satya, now that SQL Server has taken over this number one position in the Gartner Quadrant for the database market, could you help us understand how the roadmap evolves from here? As we did notice Amazon made its debut also in the leader's Quadrant, and I think we're trying to understand how the movement to cloud platforms like Azure could further alter the database landscape and how you could capitalize on that.\nAmy E. Hood: Why don't you go first.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, I'll go first. I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change. That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, in both on-premise and off-premise. And what we want to make sure as a company is to cover all of that landscape with a very rich data platform. So if you look at what we're doing, the length and breadth of our ambition as well our delivery today, everything from what SQL itself is doing, we have now all in-memory workloads for OLTP, BI, data warehousing built in. We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud. This is all the things that are coming in SQL 2016 and we're excited about that. When it comes to the cloud itself, we have a PaaS service with SQL, which is very unique in terms of SQL Azure. We have now the Data Lake service for basically petabyte, exabyte scale data management. We have higher level data services like Azure ML, which is about advanced analytics, a category we didn't even participate in the past. So we've entered that category, Revolution R fits into that. So we have a very rich story and this is not even talking about some of the other end-user BI capabilities like Power BI. So I think we have a very rich vision and execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity. And it's nice to see us innovate on the new services while we also in what is still the big market, which is the relational database market, claim a leadership position.\nAmy E. Hood: And Mark, on the total bookings number, the reason we moved to commercial bookings is it's a far more comparable number to look at period to period. Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business. If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it. But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one.\nMark R. Murphy: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nRoss MacMillan: Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I just had a couple. The first one, just your comment that the consumer Office business you're seeing, basically the subscription revenue now being larger than the offset, if you will, the license side, where do we stand with regard to that on the commercial side of the Office transition?\nAmy E. Hood: The way to think about that how is I look at \u2013 well, the way I would generally say it is you look at each of the KPIs we give. So the Office commercial business grew 5%. It was negative 8%. If some transition earning back off the balance sheet, the total cloud is 70%. When we start to get to this point and the percentage we already have in the cloud, it is really an offset. And that's probably frankly been true a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. Now that can technically, Ross, be interesting in certain quarters of the year where we have very heavy expirations. And so it just depends year over year, but that's why the commercial is slightly harder to do it on because there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality.\nRoss MacMillan: Just if I think about the incremental subscription revenues from the commercial side versus the license declines, it sounds like this year, this fiscal year, we're making that pivot like we have made on the consumer side. Would that be a fair statement?\nAmy E. Hood: I want to make this simple and unfortunately it's just slightly complicated. Because so much of our installed base was already on an annuity contract, it makes the transition mathematically hard. I think what you're asking is specifically for a transactional component when the old transactional component has gone. But it's a very hard \u2013 but that's a component of the number, not the total. So it's why it's technically difficult to answer the question you're specifically asking, Ross. But the way I would think about it is we are moving such a substantive piece of our EA business and with our annuity mix all up in commercial, up to 86% percent, we're feeling very good about our ability to transition people at LTV and grow the business overall at a very high level.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Ross.\nRoss MacMillan: Thank you very much.\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks.\nChris Suh: So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast and you can follow our comments at microsoft.com/investor.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris, and thank you to everyone joining on the phone. This quarter, we delivered $24.7 billion in revenue, up 10% in constant currency. For the year, we\u2019re at $96.7 billion in revenue, up 5%. I\u2019m proud of the progress, particularly the strength of our commercial cloud results. FY 2017 all up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with cloud, AI, and digital transformation. Our technology world view of an Intelligent Cloud and an Intelligent Edge is resonating with businesses everywhere. Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth, as well as a strategic partner who can help build their own digital capability. Microsoft is that trusted partner. Now let\u2019s look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process. The workplace is transforming from changing employee expectations, a need for more diverse skills and globally distributed teams, and an increasingly complex threat environment. Only Microsoft gives customers a comprehensive approach for this new culture of work. Earlier this month, we introduced Microsoft 365, which brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility & Security in a complete, secure solution to empower employees, safeguard businesses, and simplify IT management. Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design, build, and go-to-market to address customer needs. Fortune 500 customers Fed-Ex, Dow Chemical, Staples, Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365. The success of our Secure Productive Enterprise offering with its triple digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for businesses of all sizes. We continue to see strong growth of Office 365 with customers like Nissan, Quicken Loans, Key Bank, Deutsche Telekom all choosing Office 365. And importantly, customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt higher value workloads. For example, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage, which nearly doubled year-over-year. The classroom is also transforming. This quarter, we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education, the digital hub for students and teachers.  Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern classroom environments. With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students, share materials and manage assignments, Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love most, teaching. Now I\u2019ll talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We are investing in the LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth. We saw continued momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform, with sessions up more than 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform. We launched a new messaging overlay resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn, and introduced a career advice marketplace that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world. On top of that, Talent Solutions saw record level growth in confirmed hires and InMail response rates this quarter. I\u2019ve talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn. Earlier this month, we launched Microsoft Relationship Sales solution, bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as Dynamics 365 solutions for Retail and Talent. In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process, we continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern, modular business applications that are infused with AI. We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process applications, build new ones using Dynamics 365, Power BI, Power Apps, and Microsoft Flow. A global healthcare solution provider and partner Indegene is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales. Customers like HSBC, Best Buy, and Dolce & Gabbana all chose Dynamics 365 to transform their own businesses processes and experience the benefits of moving away from monolithic suites. Now, let\u2019s talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $18.9 billion. This quarter\u2019s cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR in fiscal 2018. More than ever before, customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft cloud. Azure revenue accelerated this quarter, growing 97% year-over-year. CIOs and Business Decision Makers increasingly prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy. They value our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted approach. And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity, as we\u2019ve done with our South Africa datacenter expansion, bringing Azure to 40 regions globally - more than any other cloud provider. And as part of our commitment to trust, we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline. AXA Global, KPMG, Dun & Bradstreet, Hearst, Walgreens, T-Mobile and Sephora all chose Azure to transform their businesses. Box announced that it will bring its content and collaboration services to Azure and plans to use our AI to simplify discovery and use of all types of content across the enterprise. And Baidu will use Azure to take its autonomous driving platform worldwide. The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. It all starts with having support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. Azure Cosmos DB is the industry\u2019s first globally distributed database service. It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at unprecedented scale and performance from IoT to AI to mobile and much more. Retailer Jet.com is using Azure Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day. Customers are infusing AI into their products & services using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as Bot Framework and Cognitive Services. Sabre, a leading technology provider to the global travel industry, is piloting AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers. And Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our Cognitive Services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent, seamless experience across online and in their stores. Azure is also unique in its support for this emerging intelligent cloud and intelligent edge applications. Azure IoT Edge extends cloud intelligence to edge devices. This means IoT devices can act locally at the edge, while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale. Azure is the first cloud to provide true hybrid support that customers predominately choose. Azure Stack extends Azure to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way whether they run on the intelligent cloud or at the intelligent edge, so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or disconnected locations like cruise ships or oil rigs. Now I\u2019ll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Against the backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10 monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem, I want to highlight a couple of key strategic areas this quarter. Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling employees to transform the way they work. Increasingly, commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation for a secure, modern workplace. Enterprise and education deployments increased 33% over the last quarter, as companies like NASCAR, Emirates Airline, BMW Group, Bank of China all adopt Windows 10. This quarter, we introduced Windows 10 S, streamlined for simplicity, security and superior performance and tailored for the classroom. Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern devices that enables affordable, powerful new scenarios from Windows ink to 3D. We also introduced Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device categories. Now on to gaming. Our gaming business is now more than $9 billion, and growing profitably. The gaming world is evolving faster than ever before - from game play across multiple devices, to the explosive growth in streaming and eSports, to new subscription services and mixed reality scenarios. We are uniquely positioned to capture a large share of this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live, now 53 million strong and growing, and to enable new experiences across PC, console and mobile. Our approach is to let gamers play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. At E3, we celebrated the passion of gamers by introducing Xbox One X, broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world\u2019s most powerful console. We launched two new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience, both of which are off to a very strong start. Mixer, our new live streaming service, makes it easier than ever before for gamers to create and share across platforms and to interact in entirely new ways. The Xbox Game Pass is a digital subscription service that expands our existing gaming value proposition. In closing, I\u2019m proud of the progress this year, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally transform. As technology disrupts every industry and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone, we strive to create local opportunity and growth and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers\u2019 success. Transformation is a continuous process of renewal and reinvestment. We will continue to invest in the high growth opportunities, lead innovation in cloud and AI, and bring our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock new value for customers. Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter\u2019s results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy Hood : Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $24.7 billion, up 9% and 10% in constant currency, with stronger than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 13% and 16% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.98, increasing 42% and 43% in constant currency, which includes $0.23 from the utilization of phone-related losses from prior years that were previously non-deductible. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth. LinkedIn\u2019s operating loss of $361 million was a 6 point drag on total company operating income growth, and is entirely attributable to the $371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx. From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends, though large markets like the US, Germany, and Japan performed better than we expected. We had a strong quarter in our commercial business, reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year. We increased commitment to our commercial cloud and healthy renewals on a record volume of expirations. We closed the highest number of multi-million-dollar Azure deals to date, and improved our annuity mix to 86%, up 3 points year-over-year. As a result, commercial bookings grew 30%, and commercial unearned revenue was $27.8 billion, significantly higher than we expected. Our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $31.5 billion. As Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $18.9 billion this quarter, growing 56%. We finished the year with nearly $15 billion in commercial cloud revenue.  At the start of the year, we committed to material improvement in commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 52%, up 10 points year-over-year, with positive gross margin in each cloud service. Commercial cloud gross margin dollars grew 92% from strength across all services. Our company gross margin was 66%, up 1 point from the prior year, as sales mix of higher margin products and services offset the impact of the growing mix of cloud revenue and $217 million of LinkedIn amortization costs. FX was mostly in line with our expectations, with 1 point of negative impact on total revenue growth even with a slightly weaker than expected US dollar. At the segment level, FX had a negative impact of 2 points on Productivity and Business Processes, 1 point on Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office Commercial revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43% and 44% in constant currency with continued installed base growth across all workloads, ARPU expansion and emerging E5 momentum. For the first time, Office 365 Commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business. Office Consumer revenue increased 13%, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, and Dynamics 365 grew 74% and 75% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately$1.1 billion, a bit better than expected. Segment gross margin dollars grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, with 12 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $217 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined from an increasing cloud revenue mix and the impact of LinkedIn related amortization. Operating expenses increased 41%, with 40 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 8% and 5% in constant currency, with 12 points of impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Our server products and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency with double digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 97%, up 98% in constant currency. Azure Premium revenue grew triple-digits for the twelfth consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements, partially offset by growth in Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 2% and 3% in constant currency with continued investment in sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income increased 15%, up 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $8.8 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency, with 4 points of decline from phone. Our OEM business grew 1% this quarter, as both our commercial and consumer OEM businesses were slightly ahead of the PC market. OEM Pro revenue grew 3%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Windows 10 deployment cycles continue to drive commercial customer hardware demand. OEM Non-Pro revenue was flat, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from Windows premium device mix. Inventories remain in the normal range. Windows commercial cloud products and services grew 8%, driven by annuity revenue growth. Enterprise customers increasingly chose Windows 10 on new and existing devices, which led to install base growth and higher adoption of our cloud security solutions. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume. Devices revenue declined 28% and 27% in constant currency. Our Surface business performed better than we expected, declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch in June. Our gaming business grew 3% and 4% in constant currency. Xbox software and services growth of 11%, 13% in constant currency, offset declines in hardware. And our engaged user base grew 8% to 53 million monthly active users across console, mobile and Windows 10 platforms. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to sales mix shift to higher margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 10%, and 9% in constant currency, from lower Phone expense, as well as Surface and gaming marketing spend in the prior year. As a result, operating income grew 68% and 72% in constant currency. Now back to the overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $3.3 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, up sequentially in part due to the planned Q3 datacenter spend pushed into this Q4. This includes approximately $2.3 billion of cash paid for property and equipment, which was down year-over-year as we utilized more capital leases. Free cash flow grew 50% year-over-year, driven primarily by operating cash flow growth of 30%, as well as lower cash outlays for CapEx. Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings growth, as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business. Other income and expense was $215 million, more than originally planned, as we continue to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains throughout the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6%, significantly lower than we expected, due to a $1.8 billion impact related to the utilization of prior years\u2019 losses from our phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred. Excluding this item, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter and 20% for the full year. This quarter, we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now let\u2019s turn to the outlook. The key trends for FY 2018 from the Financial Analyst Briefing remain largely unchanged. For the full year, we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact assuming current rates remain stable. In our commercial business, we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive a higher annuity mix. Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline driven by the transition to the cloud. We remain focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services. As a reminder, given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will experience quarterly variability. Cloud migrations, deployments and new scenarios are driving greater customer usage. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. Total CapEx spend will continue to have variability quarter-to-quarter. At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about a point in FY 2018 with increasing cloud revenue mix, a full year of LinkedIn amortization and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X. We expect LinkedIn quarterly amortization expense in COGS to be approximately $220 million, or about $880 million for the full year. Next, operating expenses. You should think about our FY 2018 operating expenses in two categories. First, organic Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth. Second, LinkedIn. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth. Additionally, we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses, including $620 million of amortization expense. Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about a point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn amortization in COGS and OpEx. Excluding the LinkedIn impact, operating margin should be flat year-over-year. Next, our effective tax rate. As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least three major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests. As cloud revenue mix increases, we anticipate our tax rate will move higher. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23%, plus or minus 2 points. And finally, we expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be non-dilutive in FY 2018, as it was in Q4. Now, to the outlook for next quarter. Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $24.85 to $25.05 billion.  In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.1 and $8.3 billion. Office 365 commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by install base growth, ARPU expansion, and adoption of premium services like E5, and should outpace the rate of transactional decline. We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business given prior year comparables. In our Dynamics business, Dynamics 365 will continue to drive our cloud mix higher. And we expect approximately $1.1 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion. Customer demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings remains strong, and we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements. We expect More Personal Computing revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion. We anticipate OEM revenue will move more closely in line with the PC market. Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior year phone comparable. Surface revenue will continue to be driven by the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. In Search, Bing\u2019s revenue growth ex-TAC should be similar to prior quarters. And we expect gaming to have the typical seasonality revenue pattern for a pre-holiday quarter. We expect COGS between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion, including approximately $400 million from LinkedIn. LinkedIn COGS include about $220 million of amortization. We expect CapEx, on an accrual dollar basis, to be similar to Q4 as we grow our investment to meet demand. We expect operating expenses of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, with about $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which roughly $155 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be about $250 million, as we expect to realize more gains from our equities portfolio. Given the volume of equity vests that occur in our first quarter and based on today\u2019s stock value, we expect our first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 4 points lower than the estimated full year tax rate. Finally, we adopted the new revenue standard, ASU 606, effective at the start of fiscal year 2018. To assist in the transition, Chris along with our Chief Accounting Officer, Frank Brod, will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss these changes, present historical restated financial results, and share Q1 guidance converted to the new standard. And with that let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. We will not move to the Q&A. Reyna, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you very much for taking the question. Amy I had a question about commercial cloud COGS, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of these roughly is related to depreciation and how should we think about the pace of your CapEx deployments versus what you have been experiencing in commercial cloud to support the initiatives in the vast growth opportunities that you see ahead as we look out over the next 12 months to 24 months if there is anything you could share with us around that. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Let me break down the question in a couple of ways. Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change. It\u2019s generally over a three-year period and there is other pieces of equipment that have a longer, shorter depreciation life. So that piece of depreciation doesn't change per se. If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure.  I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services. I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we are getting. All of those things I think, it\u2019s not really about the pace, it is much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can and I feel really good about the team's execution.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you.\nChris Suh: We will move to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. There\u2019s lot of rumors and speculation around sales reorganization of you guys sort of shifting around resources is sort of better distributed to cloud and new technologies, I was wondering if you guys could dig into that for us a little bit, what kind of changes are taking place in terms of go to market distribution heading into FY 2018?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, first of all thank you for the question Keith. Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it\u2019s the product creation, how we\u2019re organized in the R&D, how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past, how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach, and then of course even with the go to market, and this transformation is ongoing. This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much bigger than anything that we have participated in the past, so the total addressable market is much bigger. And second, our customer expectations and our partner expectations of how we show up with them has changed, and so over the years we have been making changes and now that we have a lot more momentum and critical mass, we are going to that next phase and that\u2019s what you are seeing us in terms of changing the skill set, changing the scope of how we show up to support the digital transformation needs of both large customers, as well as small businesses.\nAmy Hood: And I think in many ways Keith what we have done is a really a natural extension of some of the investments we\u2019ve made over the past 18 months to add technical resources to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes. You are seeing it even in our intelligent cloud results for the last quarter and this quarter. We\u2019re taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they will have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Keith. We will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Question for Amy, Amy there were a lot of numbers in this print that look very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%, you did touch on it a little bit in your remarks, but if you don't mind I\u2019d love to ask you a few questions, one is you mentioned that may be part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals, does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush and in other words it might have been a one-time phenomenon? Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract, structure, or invoicing to that would result in bookings being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more upfront? And lastly, is it fair to interpret the strong bookings performance as giving us and I suppose you comfort in your revenue growth profile in fiscal 2018 as all those bookings obviously convert to reported revs? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Karl. Let me make sure I cover of on most of those. Let me start by saying, the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals. The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall. There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, that\u2019s definitely not an impact on that number. And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it is really I think to your point; it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY 2018 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Thank you, Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Karl.\nChris Suh: Thanks Karl. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thank you. Amy I\u2019m wondering on the gross profit growth, I was looking through the slide deck, and looks like gross profit growth in PBT was up about 2%, you saw some strong trends in different parts of that business and I think that 2% I would have thought would have been higher, could you help us understand the puts and takes around gross profit growth in PBT?\nAmy Hood: There\u2019s a couple of things, but in general it is almost always mix shift. While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that it is also the balance, right. This is the first quarter where we\u2019ve actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual. So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.\nChris Suh: Okay. Thank you, Walter. We will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Amy commercial cloud ARR grew 24% Q-over-Q, which is the largest Q-over-Q growth so far. Completely understand that Q4 is a big quarter for closing business, but 3.7 billion is a large number, can you give us some more color on exactly what is driving this growth and then I have a quick follow-up.\nAmy Hood: Sure. When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well. But you also saw - and what really does matter, especially in Azure is usage of growth, really consumption growth having customers use deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think sort of meters up and running and that continues to build on itself, and so when you start to see that you can, and I do think and we will continue to see good growth in this number.\nMark Moerdler: Excellent. As a quick follow-up, how should we think of how that sets us up to 2018 in terms of hitting expectations, beating expectations, continuing, you know strong 40%, 50% year-over-year growth.\nAmy Hood: Let me start by saying, first I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR. Next, I think across every service the momentum we\u2019ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings. One of the things we often talk about is, we sell Microsoft 365. That\u2019s Windows 10 with securities and services. It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS. We really did see strength across all of them. So I don't really think it\u2019s about a percentage, but it\u2019s about each of them continuing to make progress.\nMark Moerdler: Excellent and congrats.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks Mark. We will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter. Question first for Amy on Office 365, Office 365 commercial revenue continues to outpace the unit growth monthly active users, so are you still seeing that trend up to E35 cetera, I wonder if you could take us through where we are in that life cycle and also just to follow on your comments to the last question, you know Satya you launched at Inspire your Microsoft 365 that Amy just mentioned, how should we think about Microsoft 365 in the context of Office 365, also just given the fact that Windows commercial actually accelerated this quarter as well.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, maybe I can start and then\u2026\nAmy Hood: Why don't you start and I will do the next one.\nSatya Nadella: So one of the things that we are very excited about and have learnt a lot from is the secure productive enterprise offer that we have had now last year and impacted Q4, it really accelerated significantly, and so that has helped us in fact come up with Microsoft 365 at this very strong offering that brings together Office 365, Windows 10, as well as our enterprise mobility and security. And support even cross-platform devices.  So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, and security across all of this estate of theirs, and that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition. So that\u2019s what Microsoft 365 embodies.  It\u2019s today available for enterprises and in the fall you will have the midmarket version of it, which I think is a another very big opportunity because it really helps take what we have learnt in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute and so we are excited about that and at Inspire the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well.\nAmy Hood: And so to your point and it\u2019s a nice transition from Satya's point about, especially the midmarket offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365 is installed base growth. You are right, in terms of Office commercial 365 the primary driver is still installed base, both the transition as well as new. I think we are optimistic as we head into FY 2018 for the installed base growth possible in particular for some of these midmarket offerings that we\u2019re quite proud off The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen in the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition. When we mentioned E5, I think that\u2019s frankly encouraging for us because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion. People start using E1 then they use E3 and then you start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that. However, in terms of ARPU impact very, very small in quarter. So that\u2019s something that over time you will continue to see improvement in terms of impact on ARPU.\nPhilip Winslow: Awesome guys thanks a lot.\nAmy Hood: Thanks.\nChris Suh: Thank you. We will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. I'm curious if you can shed a little bit more light on commercial bookings growth of 30%, clearly that\u2019s off the chart and also when I look at the $18.9 billion of annualized revenue and judging from the fact that the commercial business non-Azure component of it was about steadying growth rate up [indiscernible] Azure went through some significant acceleration, which is yet to be reflected in your forward-looking revenues. If you could just shed a little bit more light and drill into any two or three products SKUs or areas or geographies that contributed to that on the chart performance that will be great? That's it from me, thank you very much and congrats.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Kash. Let me go through the bookings, again with that 30% the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter. It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4.  Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings. I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we\u2019re pretty broad-based across industry. I would also say across geo.  And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way you\u2019d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good. That\u2019s in the KPI Windows commercial products and services. It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors.\nKash Rangan: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I am going to - if I add one thing, I will just say that nothing shows up in just one quarter. We have been working on this for a long time whether it is the product and the approach we have taken from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, even the diversity of our SaaS offerings, and also how we think about going to market. All of these have been multiple years of hard work, and clearly there is momentum across the board, and that I think is what you are seeing and we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future, but the key is for us to recognize that this is about the sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity in making sure that you line up your execution against that.\nAmy Hood: And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but it\u2019s also the investments we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve committed, we did sales overlays. We added technical resources. We put resources at customers ahead of the curve, we did that you saw that and the operating in the intelligent cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters, that execution is what\u2019s landing.\nKash Rangan: Clearly something inflected and looks like you're gaining share. So congratulations thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Kash. We will move to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you very much and I will add my congrats. Amy, going back to the size of the large size of the expiry base in Q4, when we look back three years to June 2014, in that quarter the commercial bookings grew 23%, I am just curious, is that representative of the portfolio that flowed through into this quarter on a three-year cycle, or is it more complex than that and also does it include or exclude LinkedIn contributions for the current period? And just finally, I\u2019m wondering again looking back three years, it was a different number in the September quarter that follows. And could you help us just with the year-over-year growth of the expiry base for the September quarter, I\u2019m not sure if you had commented on that?\nAmy Hood: Okay, you are right, Mark it\u2019s not exactly if I said is the Q3 from three years ago exactly the expiry base it is not exactly, but it is directionally. And so that\u2019s a good example to say, every three years tends to be the length of our agreements and so you to tend to see that repeated, and that\u2019s what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base and that is the pattern. In terms of LinkedIn having any impact? It did not. So that is the cleanest way to think about that number.\nChris Suh: Thanks Mark. We\u2019ll move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Please proceed.\nRoss MacMillan: Thanks very much and my congratulations as well. I\u2019m actually going to ask a question about the traditional server products business, which once again had a pretty strong growth rate up 5%. I think the last three quarters you have been trending at mid-single digits or even higher, and Amy I just love your thoughts as we progress through fiscal 2018, just so we think about this in the right way, you know how would you expect that sort of growth rate to trend and should we be sort of aware of the comps that come up in Q2 and beyond?\nSatya Nadella: Maybe I can start and at least give you what or how we think about it technically and product \u2013wise, and then we can go into talking about the future in terms of the results itself. First of all, we don't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud. In other words, there is intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is the architecture of pattern for which we are building, whether it is SQL server 2017 or with Windows server, the container service everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain distributed, and it turns out that it\u2019s helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their portfolios of apps as they lift shift modernize as to what they run in their data centers are in our data centers, but also forward-looking new workloads.  If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud, is cloud applications that actively require an edge Azure IOT, or Azure Stack are becoming the runtimes of the edge where you do need not only the ability to do compute and storage, but to run the AI inference and the edge. So to me that\u2019s what we\u2019re building to. It\u2019s actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications, but I quite frankly feel very, very good about leading and so in that context our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and mix shifts, but from a forward-looking perspective, I want us to be very, very clear that we anticipate the edge to be actually one of the more exciting parts of what\u2019s happening with our infrastructure.\nAmy Hood: And so that leads why I always tend to say, I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that\u2019s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem. And so I think, we remain confident that double-digit target that we have for that KPI and is it really, I don't think sort of a comparability challenge per se, but that\u2019s why we try to keep it at that high level to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion that\u2019s possible, we know we can grow within it. And I apologize, I didn't answer Marks last component, so let me just go back and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1, the answer is, it is up a little year-over-year, but in certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable. When we tend to have these, we tried to call them out like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So, Q1 I would say is just up a little. So I wouldn't expect any material impact.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Ross. We will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill in on the premium services in Azure, Satya you talked a little bit about SharePoint taking off and being a big part. Can you talk a little bit about the portfolio you have there, and I also wanted to contrast it a little bit with one of your main competitors who keeps coming up when new products just to kind of get to that premium service, and the advantage that you guys have given the IP that you build up over the years? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I mean I think we have premium services whether it\u2019s an Office 365 or in the SaaS side with a Dynamic 365 and that\u2019s where the SharePoint comment came, but there is a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond exchange or email. On the Azure side, my comments in fact walked that entire tree so to speak, which is the infrastructure there wherein flat even in the infrastructure side there is no such thing as one generic infrastructure when I look at the diversity of the virtual machines, what\u2019s happening with AI infrastructure with GPU compute. So there\u2019s a lot of richness there.  The layer about that for me is the data state, one of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, data warehouse product, the Datalake, so that is a place where we are seeing significant attach. On top of the data is where the AI services, where the bot framework, the cognitive services. So that\u2019s all the rich services where we are seeing significant customer action. The other side of it is the edge, so Azure IOT, our service both in the cloud and the edge and Azure Stack now truly are starting this quarter is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud deployment.  So that\u2019s what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have. And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services, as well as Azure is Azure active trajectory. 90% of all the enterprises use Active directory and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what applications they have in whichever cloud because that becomes a very key control plane for IT.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks Raimo. We will just have one more question Reyna, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great thanks very much. Amy, as the Azure business continues to gain scale and to Raimo\u2019s question the premium mix continues to be kind of bigger part of that, is there any reason to think that the gross margin gain shouldn't accelerate in 2018 versus where they were in 2017? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Brad. The way I tend to think about it is, with any service you want the gross margin itself to improve, and that includes in the Azure services components themselves. The difference between core compute in-store versus the premium layers can be significant and we\u2019ve had improvements across all of them. So, the real question on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about sort of the ultimate mix of those. Anyhow, we saw significant improvement this year. We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but that\u2019s why I tend to not focus at that layer it\u2019s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time you\u2019d expect a higher mix of premium versus core.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much.\nChris Suh: Thanks Brad. So that wraps up the Q&A portion in today's earnings call. As Amy mentioned, Frank and I will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss the changes under the new revenue standards, you can find additional details for that on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when available. Thank you again for joining us today.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results of the third quarter and discuss what's ahead. I'm proud of the progress this quarter. We delivered $23.6 billion in revenue, up 7% in constant currency. Across all industries, organizations are looking to digitally transform with the state-of-the-art cloud services, AI, and new natural user interface technology. Increasingly, these organizations are turning to Microsoft as a partner they can trust for the innovation and building their own digital capability. Now let's look at the progress we made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial. Office 365 Commercial seats grew 35% year over year, and revenue is up 45% in constant currency. Across industries, customers recognize Office 365 is the productivity platform of choice, companies like H&R Block, Johnson & Johnson, and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, LVMH, as all chose Office 365. And we continue to innovate and add new value. This quarter we made Microsoft Teams broadly available to Office 365 customers in 181 markets. Our new chat-based workspace is already empowering a new way to work for more than 50,000 customers, including Accenture, J. Walter Thompson, J.B. Hunt, and Expedia. Teams also creates a new platform opportunity for developers to reach 100 million Office 365 users with rich extensibility for bots, apps, and services. Additionally, we are expanding the relevance of Office 365 to new segments. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing companies have a huge need to empower their front-line employees. Our expanded offering for this segment includes Microsoft StaffHub, Teams, OneDrive, Skype for Business, and more to give these critical employees a robust collaboration toolkit to maximize their impact. Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing Business Process. Accelerating our growth with LinkedIn by driving value for members and customers remains our top priority. This quarter we redesigned the LinkedIn desktop to create a more seamless intuitive experience across devices. We continue to invest in the LinkedIn Feed, bringing curated news and views to help members stay informed on what's most important to them. Our innovation across both the desktop and mobile is driving strong engagement momentum, with sessions up more than 20% again this quarter. LinkedIn marked an important milestone this week, exceeding 500 million members, and our jobs platform hit new record levels with more than 10 million jobs posted. This strong momentum with jobs and engagement is continuing to fuel the growth across talent, marketing, sales, and learning solutions. We took significant steps this week to redefine social selling with deeper integration of Sales Navigator with Dynamics 365, enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. Customers like Visa are choosing Dynamics 365 because of our deep integration across Office 365 and now Sales Navigator. I'm excited to put the Microsoft enterprise sales force and partner ecosystem behind this new opportunity. Dynamics 365 solves a critical challenge for businesses, helping them break free of monolithic siloed suites of applications to unlock insights across the entire organization. You see this in our new Dynamics 365 talent applications, which combines HR business processes with LinkedIn Recruiter to help companies manage the employee lifecycle from recruiting to retention. Our innovation in Dynamics is driving strong revenue growth, with Dynamics 365 up 82% in constant currency this quarter. Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $15.2 billion. Customers are increasingly choosing the Microsoft Cloud. They value our differentiated approach as the most trusted global hyperscale cloud with hybrid support and higher-level services to help drive their digital transformation. Moreover, they appreciate the agility, operational consistency, and security across the entire digital estate, spanning enterprise mobility, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure. Take Maersk, the largest transport and logistics firm in the world with operations in 130 countries and a fleet of over 1,000 vessels. Maersk began their journey to the Microsoft Cloud with Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security in Windows 10. They chose Dynamics 365 for operations to streamline container production and maintenance. Now Maersk is using Azure to digitally transform its supply chain management and global trade. The intelligent services in Azure deliver up-to-the-minute insights on carrier performance and equipment usage with real-time data visualization and advanced analytics, enabling them to trim costs and create new revenue streams. For a company that ships 17 million containers annually, the ability to react quickly can mean the difference of tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. This is a great example of our three clouds coming together to enable deep digital transformation. Across industries, customers are choosing Azure. UBS announced they're using Azure for risk management, and GEICO chose Azure for hybrid capabilities. Publicis Groupe announced that they will use Azure and Cortana Intelligence Suite to deliver AI-powered marketing solutions at scale. Flipkart, India's this leading online marketplace, chose Azure as the platform to enable their rapid growth. We continue to rapidly innovate and add new capability to drive further customer value. Microsoft IoT Central is the first SaaS offering that provides the end-to-end solution for organizations of all sizes to manage their entire IoT ecosystem across devices, cloud, analytics, networks, and software. This week at Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial trade show, manufacturers showcased how they're using our solutions to transform all aspects of manufacturing, from water management to food and beverage packaging, to improving safety on the factory floor. When it comes to AI, this quarter we made our cognitive services for face recognition and computer vision broadly available to enable any developer to become an AI developer. We're excited about how Azure Stack and SQL Server are helping define the edge computing paradigm. Azure Stack will enable customers to extend Azure capability to their private data center in a truly consistent hybrid computing environment. SQL Server 2017, coming this fall, is the first database with cloud tiering and artificial intelligence built in. It runs on Windows and Linux, supports docker container deployment and popular programming languages such as R and Python for machine learning and data science. We will share more about all these advances and more at our upcoming Build Developer Conference. Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Almost two years ago we introduced a new approach with Windows 10, transforming the way customers experience Windows on all their devices. Now customers are always up to date running the most secure Windows ever. This quarter, the Windows business grew 5% in constant currency, and we delivered the next phase of innovation with the Creators Update. Creators Update is about inspiring the creator in us all. We create technology so that others can create their own content and technology. We want to empower people to paint in 3D or paint with numbers in Excel. We empower people to create in Word or in Minecraft. These new forms of creation and expression are shaping Windows for the next generation. Gaming is a key scenario to expand our opportunity across the PC and console. We are building on our already strong foundation with Xbox One and our Xbox Live community, up 13% to 52 million active users this quarter. With Creators Update, we integrated gameplay broadcasting into Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. We're off to a very strong start with both streamers and viewers. In fact, the majority of the streaming in this industry today is on the PC and console, and we are uniquely positioned to provide the best, most complete gaming experience, from hardware to software to broadcast services. It's early days and we are excited to pursue this new growing opportunity. This quarter, we also revealed more about our forthcoming Project Scorpio, which will be the most powerful console ever and will enable true 4K gaming in the living room. Our commercial customers continue to adopt Windows 10 as the secure trusted platform of choice. Customers like the Department of Education in the United Kingdom, British Telecommunications, the Adventist Health System, one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, all chose Windows 10. When I talk to businesses and government leaders, they value security and privacy of their data, the reliability of their systems, and choice and control over how and when they deploy. We remain committed to our core values of trust, transparency, privacy, and security for every customer. Finally, devices; this quarter our Surface results fell short of expectations, impacted by end of product lifecycle and increased price competition. We continue to innovate and invest in creating new computers and computing experiences. Surface Pro, Book, Hub, Studio, HoloLens are all creating new markets for the Windows ecosystem and pushing differentiation with new natural user-interface capabilities, ink, vision, voice, touch, and mixed reality. In the context of mixed reality, we just passed the one-year anniversary of Microsoft HoloLens. We now have more than 150 exclusive HoloLens apps in the store. Moreover, many of our commercial customers are using HoloLens to drive digital transformation and seeing real impact. HoloLens-based innovation was featured front and center at NRF, HIMSS, and most recently this week at Hannover. Digital transformation across these industries is being shaped by new technologies, from IoT to mixed reality to AI and the cloud. thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens and Azure to digitize their entire sales and order process, shortening delivery times by four times, and they chose Dynamics 365 to enable transformation in their Steel division. Leading global medical technology company Stryker chose Office 365 to empower employees and is using HoloLens to improve operating room designs for surgeons, staff, and ultimately the patients. All this creates a strong foundation for the broader opportunity ahead with digital transformation. I'm proud of the progress this quarter. I'm enthusiastic about what's to come. In the coming weeks, we will share more about how Microsoft is innovating uniquely to empower every customer, from students and teachers to business professionals to developers. Now, let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, up 6% and 7% in constant currency; gross margin grew 7% and 9% in constant currency; operating income grew 2% or 5% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $0.73, an increase of 16% and 19% in constant currency. This was the first full quarter of company results of LinkedIn, which had a significant impact on revenue, gross margin, and operating income. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth, which includes $371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles. From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends. Our performance in Japan was better than expected, driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions. Our commercial annuity mix was 88%, even with another quarter of higher than expected transactional revenue results. Commercial bookings increased 12% or 11% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue followed historical seasonal trends, coming in at $20.4 billion and growing 9% and 10% in constant currency. And our contracted-not-billed balance increased to more than $27.5 billion. Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased to 51%, up 6 points from last year, with improvement across Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics. And gross margin dollars grew 74%, keeping us on pace for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year. As a reminder, our commercial cloud includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, but does not include LinkedIn. Our company gross margin was 66%, better than anticipated and up 1 point, as the sales mix of higher-margin product and services coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement more than offset the impact of $218 million of LinkedIn amortization. Now to FX. This quarter, the U.S. dollar was weaker than expected. As such, we had 1 point less FX impact across our individual reporting segments, even though overall company impact was still approximately 1 point as guided. FX impacted the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments by 1 point and had minimal impact in More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense. Now, let's move to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 22% and 23% in constant currency to $8 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 45%, driven by installed base growth across all workloads and continued ARPU expansion. Our transactional results came in higher than expected, mostly from performance in large markets like Japan and Western Europe. Office consumer revenue increased 15% and 14% in constant currency, primarily from recurring subscription revenue as well as growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with Dynamics 365 customer momentum contributing to double-digit billings growth. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was $975 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Gross margin percentage declined due to a higher mix of cloud revenue and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization. Operating expenses increased 44% and 45% in constant currency, with 43 points from LinkedIn, including $153 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency, with 13 points of impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 15%, up 16% in constant currency, demonstrating durable double-digit growth. Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency, and annuity revenue again grew double digits. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using our premium services. Our Windows Server and SQL Server transactional business continued to perform well; with better than expected results mainly from Japan and continuing post-launch demand. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue declined 1% and was flat in constant currency due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements. Segment gross margin dollars grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 11%, with ongoing investment in sales capacity, cloud engineering, and developer engagement. Operating income was flat and up 3% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $8.8 billion, declining 7%, as Phone and Surface results offset healthy growth in Windows, search, and gaming. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 10%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Additionally, the commercial PC market was slightly below our expectations, negatively impacted by channel production timing changes and upcoming Windows SKU pricing changes. Commercial end customer demand signals remain consistent and positive. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows Premium device category. Overall, inventory levels remain in the normal range. Windows Commercial products and services grew 6%, with healthy enterprise demand as customers continued to deploy Windows 10 for its advanced security and management capabilities. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume. Devices revenue declined 51%. We had no material Phone revenue this quarter. Our Surface business declined 26% and 25% in constant currency, as heightened price competition and product end-of-lifecycle dynamics resulted in lower than expected Surface Pro unit volumes. Our gaming business grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, as Xbox Live revenue growth offset declines in hardware. Xbox Live monthly active users grew 13% across Xbox One, Windows 10, and mobile platforms, which contributed to software and services revenue growth of 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with the sales shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 11% and 10% in constant currency from lower Phone expense and Surface launch-related marketing spend in the prior year. Operating income grew 20% in 23% in constant currency. Now back to overall company results, we invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, less than we expected, as a portion of the expense will move into Q4. Other income and expense was $322 million, greater than originally planned, as we saw more opportunities in the equity market to realize gains during the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23%. We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation through share repurchase and dividends. After a period of accelerated buyback, we've resumed a buyback pace consistent with our historical trends. Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX. Given current rates, we now expect less FX headwinds in our fourth quarter. We expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Second, our commercial business, the fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of Commercial Cloud services. We expect unearned revenue between $26.8 billion and $27 billion, in line with historical seasonality. Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted-not-billed balance and commercial bookings growth. Third, capital expenditure, we expect CapEx to grow sequentially and year over year. Quarterly spend variability will continue, and we remain on track for our full-year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow. Let's move to the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and Commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior-year comparables. We expect consistent growth from Dynamics and approximately $1.05 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. Similar to Q3, we anticipate that LinkedIn, excluding amortization, will have minimal impact on segment operating income, and we continue to expect it to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this fiscal year. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion in revenue. Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline with lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate that revenue growth will be more aligned with the overall PC market. OEM Pro growth will continue to be driven by Windows 10 Enterprise momentum and aligned to a commercial PC market that should return to typical seasonality. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, with continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q3. In gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3 in June, where we will share more on Project Scorpio and new titles for next fiscal year. And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from Phone. With Surface, we expect a more moderate rate of decline given the prior-year comparable and current market dynamics. We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. This includes approximately $420 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with roughly $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which $150 million is related to amortization. We now expect full-year operating expenses between $32.9 billion and $33 billion, with approximately $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. That includes about $360 million of amortization expense. Other income and expense should be about $150 million. And for tax, we expect the full fiscal year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% plus or minus 1 point. Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events, our Education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3, and the upcoming keynote from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY 2018. We will also host our financial analyst briefing on May 10. The webcast will be available our Investor Relations website. Chris, let's move to Q&A.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of today's call. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent, thank you very much for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. You gave us some really interesting statistics about gross margins going up, premium mix going up. One of the concerns I hear a lot from investors is what happens when we get these price cuts that go back and forth between you guys and AWS? It doesn't seem like the price cuts this quarter really affected you guys. So I was hoping you could shed some light on how \u2013 to what degree do those price cuts actually affect you. And then on the flip side, where does all that growth come from? Where do you get that tripling of premium growth from what kind of workflows are coming on board to actually drive the underlying growth in that business?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Sure, thanks for the question, Keith. Let me start and then, Amy, if you want, you can add. Again, Keith, when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture, and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these themes across Azure or 365, Dynamics 365, and also the things that we're doing with Xbox Live, for example, all billed as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud. So for example, some of the cognitive capabilities that are there in Azure first come because of our first-party AI investments, whether it's been speech or vision or anything else. Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again Bing in other areas. So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together. And that same thing is reflected even in the customer journeys. I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one, where it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. In the case of Maersk, they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365. So to me, those high-level services will over time attach in Azure, but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365. So to me, that's why Azure is pretty strategic for us, not just for the attachment of high-level services in what is defined as Azure, but the all-up digital transformation opportunity. That's how Amy and I even think about our margin structure. We need to improve in each one of the elements, but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what's unique about our approach.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not. And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Outstanding, thank you very much.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Keith. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks. I've got a follow-up, actually, on Azure, maybe to you, Satya, and it's the interplay between the cloud piece Azure and mostly the on-prem piece, what you guys call the server product. Most of your peers obviously, when they're pivoting to the cloud, are seeing weakness on the on-prem side. But what's unique about Microsoft is not only is Azure growth accelerating, but your server product growth at 7% is up meaningfully year over year as well, so we're not seeing that trade-off with Microsoft. I suspect part of the explanation is that a lot of the Azure growth is net new, but I'm just curious. When do you think customers will actually start migrating existing on-prem Microsoft workloads into Azure such that that server product line might start to decelerate? Do you think there's a prospect of that occurring in fiscal 2018? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. The timeframes of these migrations and so on are a lot more complicated than they perhaps appear on the surface. So here's what we think of. For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge. So if you look even at our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge. Of course, we have an amazing cloud with the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting. Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid. I mean, GEICO example is a good one. What's happening with SQL Server, SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise. It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. A single table can be extended to the cloud. The queries will work across both the tiering. And so to me, the innovative work we're doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that's what we are building towards. We'll talk a lot more and build on that about that architecture and what we're seeing with customers. Then given that what you are saying is true, which is there will be some which will be lift and shift of workloads, but then there is lift, shift, and modernizing of workloads. And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. And so that's the transformation at play. That's a multiyear and a generational transformation. Quarter to quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility. But what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft's engineers is that we have a very clear world view of what is it that we want to get done, and we stay focused on it.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction. And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out. It tends to be \u2013 in this instance, Japan was a little better. It can be product-launch related. It can be macro-impacted. But whether or not you see that in transactional, the Uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamic Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about, whether it's a quote-unquote, on-prem server launch or an Azure feature, about the integration of the two.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect, thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Karl. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Again, I had a follow-up on Azure as well. I was just wondering, Satya, if you could share with us \u2013 and I know I've asked this in the past \u2013 but just any qualitative commentary you could give us about PaaS adoption. And I'm also wondering in particular, given the high percentage of workloads on Azure running Linux, what type of services are you typically seeing run on top of the OS? And how do you see your monetization of those workloads playing out over time? And then, Amy, just the follow-up for you would just be \u2013 and I apologize, we had another earnings call tonight, so I might have missed it \u2013 but you usually give a comment about out-year OpEx on the call, and I was just wondering if you had any high-level thoughts there. Sorry, thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Sure, Heather, thanks for the question. Overall qualitatively, in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about, like IoT. We now have a much higher-level managed service. We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions, instead of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services. Same thing with data, the DocumentDB is a massive thing for us. It's the planet-scale database that supports JSON and much more, and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many, many applications. We even see, obviously, the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to enterprise mobility. So all-up, we have multiple pieces. The other areas, course, the entire toolchain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration, to continuous deployment, and that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which in some sense you can think of as like the Office 365 for developers. But that's all part of Azure. So those are the places where there are PaaS services. But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers, because we know that over time, it may be not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be in fact a Dynamics 365 module. The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service. So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, excellent, two questions. What were the drivers of the big growth in Dynamics 365? Is this large seasonality specifically in this quarter? Is it a big deal, or should we expect growth in the same vicinity for the near future? And then as a second question, as discussed in, one of the previous questions about Server & Tools and the healthiness of that growth, I'm trying to understand the drivers. Is this the product refresh cycle? Is it Azure driving customer upgrades? Is it something else? Can you give a bit more color? That would be helpful. I appreciate it.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Sure, Mark, and let me start and then Amy, you can add. On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern modular SaaS service. The Dynamics 365 momentum is picking up. I talked about the revenue growth rate, and that's definitely going to be what's going to be true in the quarters to come and the years to come. But we do have a huge on-premise base. There is still a need for those on-premise products. That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud. And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365. You've seen us do that with Azure. And now we're ready to do that mainstream across what has been traditionally known as CRM and ERP without in fact us thinking and talking about those suites because we think that is a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern, and much more efficient for customers. So that's what's happening in Dynamics. Same thing on Azure, which is \u2013 the driver is \u2013 a lot of it is net new. IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world, whereas it's one of the big workloads for us. Same thing with AI, not an old workload. So there's new growth in Azure. There is the lift, shift, and modernize motion as well, as well as a new need for the edge of the cloud. So all three of them are in play, while recognizing we had a large business called the Server Licensing business. So we have three new things that we're driving and a lot of large licensing pieces that are just transitioning into these three motions.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us. The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter. In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature. Japan happens to be one of those geos. And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent. So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent, I appreciate it. Thank you and congrats.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks, two things, Amy. I think you mentioned in the script that Windows \u2013 there was some Windows volatility around some new SKU pricing. Could you go into some detail there? And then secondarily \u2013 I know we may get this at Analyst Day, but around ASC 606, I knew you're going to adopt that early, and I think that will change to some degree your annuity revenue. I wondered if you could give us any color, even directionally, on what percentage of that annuity revenue is licensed that after ASC 606 will go up front.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Great. On ASC 606, we will talk about it in detail actually on May 10 in terms of the timing and what you can expect. You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example. The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change in some ways back to how we thought about OEM revenue. So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then a question on...\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Windows, I'm sorry. I answered them in the opposite order. And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value. This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. And so what you'll continue to see is that would normalize. Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Walter. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, so two quick questions. First off, Amy, there's been a lot of talk about tax law changes on the corporate side. Would a repatriation holiday impact how you guys allocate capital back to shareholders? And then just real quickly, on the OpEx side, I know you don't want to get too specific, but over the last few years you've been able to effectively reallocate upwards of $2 billion from the Phone business elsewhere. Is there still a fair amount of ability to reallocate internally? Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Great, let me take both of those. Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking two that I probably don't relate as directly, and I should do that for you. We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out. And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us. Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return, as you know, I think we've been and executed a significant capital return program over the past couple years, including accelerating the buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created. And so I wouldn't say that I view those two things as waiting for one to do the other. We've in fact continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends, as well as repurchase shares. And we've continued to do that this quarter as well. I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related. The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS. At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them. So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities. We learn, frankly, I think every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate. That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. More I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more and if we aren't, it won't. And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number.\nBrad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks very much.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Brad. We'll take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nKirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I want to follow up on your last point around investment and return on it. Around this time last year, you guys started spending a lot more or investing a lot more in OpEx on the Intelligent Cloud side in particular. This quarter, you saw Intelligent Cloud operating profit on a constant currency basis get back to growth again, which I think shows that those investments indeed made some sense. Now that you have spent a lot, you've obviously added a lot in sales and marketing resources, R&D resources on that front. Could you just give us I guess qualitatively how you're thinking about that? It seemed like last year, you needed to catch up to a certain degree in terms of go-to-market capabilities. Do you feel better I guess where you are today versus your position, say, a year ago, just in terms of being able to capture the opportunity on the Intelligent Cloud side? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I'll start and then I'll transition to you, Amy. I don't view it that narrowly quarter to quarter or even year to year. These are generational opportunities that what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter to quarter or year to year, we'll completely miss the trend. We definitely need to be smart about two things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. And most importantly, what's our role in it? Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing, or is it well served by others? That's where we spend most of our cycles in. The fact that we put some salespeople and then there's increased productivity is something that we obviously celebrate and we track very closely. But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. And it won't be very transparent to you, and that's how it is. If we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't have even had Azure. But I completely understand that all of you measure us to what we have done for you lately. And that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments. And are they earning the right return? Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the might market? Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities? What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers. And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Great, thank you, Kirk. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, thank you very much. Satya, I'm curious, how is the pace of the conversations around Internet of Things, machine learning, and cognitive services? And also, what are you seeing as the killer app types of use cases that could resonate with customers in terms of the more mainstream applicability? And also, Amy, just given the strength in commercial bookings and also commercial bookings guidance, macroeconomically do you see any signs of enterprise budgets opening up somewhat or different activity levels, more receptivity to transformative projects? I'm just trying to understand maybe how we can separate out your company-specific momentum against any conceivable incremental macro tailwind.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: That's great, so let me start. The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome. So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency, or how they can change the products and the business models and the products. And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they are trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative. There is machine learning in AI. There is IoT. There is new type of business process automation with operations. All of that is transforming Maersk. What thyssenkrupp has done in their Elevator business and other business units by using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it. Those are the killer transformation opportunities that we are seeing. And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these. And in that context, of course, they're lifting and shifting some of the older workloads, but they're modernizing the entire business process flow. And that's what's I think the killer opportunity, not any one technology, but the entire flow.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think your question about is it really budgets, I think you used the phrase opening up. What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do. Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen. For me, what I think is missing in that question is really \u2013 it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more. These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself. And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently. And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly. This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much. Two, I think both for Amy. The first is that now that Azure gross margins have turned positive, would you say it would be reasonable to assume that the Creative Cloud gross margins should continue to increase sequentially going forward, or could other factors still create some volatility quarter to quarter?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better. That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement. Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really. The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change. And so while year over year you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past six quarters, even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying and underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful, and maybe one other, if I could. Just on CapEx, I know there was a timing delta here between Q3 and Q4, but I just wanted to step back. If you think about your CapEx plans ex-LinkedIn as you came into the year and how you think you'll end up, are you going to be about on plan, or do you think you'll be above or below? Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks. In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track. And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3. I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, thanks so much.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Ross. We'll have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Awesome, thanks, guys, for sneaking me in. Just a question on Office commercial. You guys reported another strong quarter here, about 8% constant currency growth. And, obviously, you're continuing that acceleration that you've had over the first three quarters of this year. Now, I guess the question to Satya and then Amy. Satya, you still have a positive mix shift going on here because we see the unit count growth, but also the revenue growth, so positive spread there. Maybe help me walk through where you think we are in this life cycle of Office 365 because you obviously have a lot of SKUs. And then, Amy, in that context, to the last question on gross margins for commercial cloud. Obviously, we've made a lot of headway on Azure. How do think where we are similarly on the life cycle on the gross margin side of Office 365?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah, I can start. I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions. A lot of what we are still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth. Now we have a good start with what is at the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5, some of the value we have. Whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates. And we're learning, we're improving, and we're pushing forward on that front. At the same time, we're also introducing new SKUs for the front-line worker. This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space. It comes at a different ASP point, so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365. We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business. The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets. And we finally get to do that with the service offering. So those are all the areas. Where there's significant room left \u2013 and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out. And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition. So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving. We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature. I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results of the second quarter and discuss what's ahead. We had a solid quarter overall, delivering $26.1 billion in revenue, up 4% in constant currency. More importantly, we are making progress by innovating in new areas, growing our addressable market opportunity, and transforming our culture. Wherever I go in my travels, whether it's in conversations with heads of state, NGOs, or CEOs, the common thread is the transformative power of digital technology to unlock new opportunity. Everyone I meet is talking about building their own digital capability to transform their products, service, and business model. They're looking to Microsoft for security, productivity, business process, cloud, and AI platforms to help drive their own transformation. In this last quarter, we have continued to build momentum across all of these areas, and in particular AI. Just this month we acquired an AI deep learning startup, Maluuba, whose work in natural language processing will help advance our strategy to democratize AI for everyone. With that as a backdrop, I'll turn to progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. Office 365 commercial seats grew 37% year over year and revenue is up 49% in constant currency. We're changing the nature of work, with Office as the universal tool kit to help people and teams accomplish more together. To that end, this quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams, our new chat-based workspace for Office 365. It brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365 as well as connections to third-party services, all in a secure hub for teamwork. We are seeing strong demand for the preview from our existing Office 365 customers due to the deep integration of the rest of the Office platform. And at the same time, customers not yet on Office 365 are excited about this new way to work to see Teams as a potential first cloud workload. In addition to collaboration, our innovation and security and compliance continues to drive customer preference for Office 365. This quarter we added new capabilities to give IT better ways to help their users safely connect to third-party applications. And for compliance, new eDiscovery capabilities make it easier and faster for organizations to find and analyze information related to legal and regulatory requests. Customers also find value in the integration of SharePoint with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow to quickly and easily build mobile apps and automate workflows. In fact, just eight weeks after availability, we have seen more than 0.5 million people use PowerApps or Flow. This combination of productivity, security, and agility is incredibly valuable to customers, particularly in sectors like financial services and healthcare. Take Willis Towers Watson, a global financial services firm, who chose our premium enterprise offering, including Office 365 E5. Global Fortune 500 companies TD Bank and AXA as well as Partners HealthCare and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center all chose Office 365 for its powerful security and productivity platform. And AstraZeneca recently upgraded Office 365 E5 for its advanced voice capabilities. We're also expanding our growth opportunity beyond information workers by creating productivity solutions for retail, restaurant, hospitality, and manufacturing employees, who have traditionally been underserved by technology providers. Microsoft's StaffHub, a new application in Office 365, provides shift scheduling, messaging, and sharing capabilities for all these front-line workers. Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We completed the acquisition of LinkedIn in December, marking the start of our journey to bring together the world's professional cloud with the world's leading professional network. Our top priority is to ensure we innovate and drive value for LinkedIn members and grow their daily engagement. The LinkedIn business solutions, hire, market, sell, and learn, represent an expanded market opportunity for Microsoft, and we plan to diligently execute on this opportunity, keeping the member-first ethos in focus. We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016. This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page views and feed interaction, creating a healthy foundation for LinkedIn's marketing solutions, which include the rapidly growing Sponsored Updates. We also saw members engage with LinkedIn's hiring products at record levels as part of talent solutions. And LinkedIn's sales solutions have also seen rapid growth, with Sales Navigator seats up more than 20% year over year during the quarter. Sales Navigator's success on multiple CRM platforms makes it an essential tool for every B2B salesperson and one of our first integration scenarios will be to redefine social selling by enhancing Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn capabilities. The combination of LinkedIn's business solutions and Dynamics 365 gives us a more comprehensive portfolio of business SaaS solutions and strengthens our position in this growing and competitive market. Dynamics 365 paid seats more than doubled again this quarter and new enterprise customers are increasingly choosing our cloud solutions, with more than 80% choosing Dynamics 365. DefenseReady is using Dynamics to give military leaders a 360-degree view of their organizations to quickly make informed decisions about capacity planning, and operations. Amway is using Dynamics 365 to modernize and empower their entrepreneurial sales force around the globe. Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $14 billion, and we're on track to achieve our $20 billion in fiscal 2018. Customers choose the Microsoft Cloud for the following reasons. They want a trusted global hyperscale cloud provider that meets enterprise-grade needs. They want hybrid support that is architected into the hyperscale service as well as the cloud service. They want higher level services to help build their own digital capability across IoT, enterprise app dev, advanced analytics, and AI capability. Moreover and most importantly, CIOs, CSOs, BDMs, and developers are all seeing the benefit from operational consistency, productivity, and security across their entire digital estate, spanning Windows 10 Cloud and Security Management, Office 365, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility, and Azure. A prime example is Mars, a $35 billion business with 60 brands. An early adopter of Office 365, Mars is using Office and Windows 10 to transform how its 80,000-strong global workforce collaborates while staying secure. And more recently, they have begun running mission-critical workloads on Azure with hundreds more on the way, including inventory management using Azure IoT. Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is digitizing work for nearly 20,000 drivers with Office 365 and Skype and is using Azure to harness the data from their sensor-equipped trucks to optimize driver productivity and safety. Across industries, we continue to see strong customer demand for our differentiated cloud solutions. Azure revenue grew 95% in constant currency this quarter. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 10th consecutive quarter, and more than three out of four Azure customers are using Premium services. We are also leading the next-generation programming model in developer services innovation with conversational bots, microservices, and event-driven serverless compute to help businesses rapidly gain the benefits of cloud infrastructure. Our bot framework is being used by more than 77,000 developers to do everything from e-commerce to customer service. Azure functions is helping companies like AccuWeather and Plexure to quickly and easily implement business-critical event-driven serverless processes. And everyone from game developers to financial services companies are using Azure Service Fabric for their low-latency high-scale microservices applications. We're also rapidly expanding our portfolio of data and AI capabilities in Azure. Cognitive services, now deeply integrated with Azure Data Lake, enables customers to use industry-leading AI capabilities to easily analyze images, text, emotions, speech, sentiments at terabyte scale. In our push to meet the needs of any developer on any platform, we joined the Linux Foundation, welcomed Google to the .NET Foundation, and announced a new Azure partnership with OpenAI to accelerate our vision. At the edge of our cloud, Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016 give enterprises Azure-inspired scale and innovation for secure infrastructure and cloud applications. Customers have already deployed more than 1 million instances of Windows Server 2016, and the new SQL Server drove a 5X increase in developer downloads in Q2 versus Q1. Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. This quarter, we saw growth across Windows broadly. First, Windows 10 commercial customers are rapidly adopting Windows 10, driven by their need for a secure and trusted platform. In fact, this quarter enterprise and education deployments increased 52%. Accenture, Broward County School District, UnitedHealthcare Group, are just a few that are choosing Windows 10 as their modern, secure enterprise-grade platform. These three commercial customers alone have already deployed more than 300,000 seats with commitments to deploy over 0.5 million. The consumer PC market is also stabilizing. Gamers are increasingly turning to Windows 10 premium PCs for the best gaming experiences, logging more than 26 billion hours of game play on PCs and tablets this year. One reason gamers love their Windows 10 PC is because they can connect to their favorite games and social network on Xbox Live. Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 55 million this quarter, a new record, with growth across PCs, mobile, as well as the console. Windows 10 Creators Update will bring 3D, mixed reality and game broadcasting to all Windows 10 customers. Partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Acer are investing to deliver cutting-edge virtual reality experiences for customers using Windows 10 Holographic platform. We are also broadening our opportunity through partnerships with chipset makers Intel as well as Qualcomm, who have committed to build the next generation of modern Windows PCs with advanced security, connectivity, AI, mixed reality, and gaming. Our services innovation and user engagement on Windows 10 continues to grow. Users have asked Cortana more than 18 billion questions to date, and we are opening up new addressable markets with Cortana Devices SDK. BMW, Renault-Nissan, Harman are all using Cortana to embed voice-activated intelligence into their portfolio of products. Finally, let's talk about devices. I'm excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in the Surface line and a new device category. Overall commercial demand for Surface remains strong, with three consecutive quarters of more than 25% growth. Organizations across industries are looking to Surface to help them achieve more, such as Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs in the United Kingdom rolling out Surface to more than 25,000 of its employees. We're expanding into new markets with HoloLens. Commercial customers like ThyssenKrupp Elevator are using HoloLens to enable servicing up to four times faster than ever before, and we look forward to making HoloLens available in China in the first half of this year. As customers embrace these new computers and computing experiences, we're generating enthusiasm for Windows 10 and new forms of expression, creativity, and gaming that it can unleash. I'm proud of the progress we made this quarter and during the entire first half of the year. We look to the second half with a clear focus on execution and innovation. We have a significant opportunity this year and beyond for growth across every one of our segments. We're uniquely positioned to build the technology to help every person and organization take advantage of new innovations like AI and use them to drive their own growth and transformation. Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to reiterate that my commentary reflects our performance inclusive of approximately three weeks of LinkedIn results. For this quarter only, I will comment on our results excluding LinkedIn for consistency with the guidance provided last quarter. I encourage you to reference our earnings slides for supplemental information. Our second quarter revenue was $26.1 billion, up 2% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency. Operating income grew 5% or 8% in constant currency. And earnings per share were $0.83, an increase of 9% and 13% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, our second quarter revenue was $25.8 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. Gross margin increased 3% and 4% in constant currency. Operating income grew 8% and 11% in constant currency. And our EPS was $0.84, increasing 11% and 15% in constant currency. Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our results were largely in line with macroeconomic trends, with additional benefit from a healthier PC market, particularly in the commercial segment. Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year over year to 84%, even with better than expected transactional revenue performance. Commercial bookings increased 7% or 12% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $21.1 billion, growing 8% and 9% in constant currency, even with an FX headwind of approximately $150 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar through the quarter. And our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high, exceeding $28 billion. Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48%, up 2 points from last year, largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud. We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year. Now to company gross margin, gross margin was approximately 62% inclusive of LinkedIn, up slightly from the prior year. This quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major currencies created additional negative FX impact on total and segment level revenue. On total revenue, FX had a 2-point negative impact, a point more than expected, with no additional impact from LinkedIn. In both Productivity and Business Processes and the Intelligent Cloud segments, the FX impact was 2 points, 1 point more than expected. And in More Personal Computing, FX had a 1-point impact, in line with expectations. Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were under our guidance range primarily due to a favorable one-time legal settlement and FX benefits. Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10% and 12% in constant currency to $7.4 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 7% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased by 47% or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of install base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion. We also continued to see higher than expected results from our transactional business, in part due to an improving commercial PC market. Office Consumer revenue grew 22% or 21% in constant currency, as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue. In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period. Our Dynamics business grew 7%, up 9% in constant currency, and our Dynamics 365 install base more than doubled. LinkedIn revenue for the three-week period from December 8 to the end of the quarter was $228 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly a point of impact from LinkedIn. Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition. Operating income declined slightly but was up 1% in constant currency and up 7% in constant currency excluding LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion of revenue, growing 8% and 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher than expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth declined this quarter 4% and 2% in constant currency due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency. And segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower Enterprise Services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency. Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger than expected performance from our Windows business. Overall, revenue declined 5% and 4% in constant currency. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro grew 6%, better than we anticipated, driven by an improving commercial PC market and enterprise demand for Windows 10. OEM non-Pro grew 5%, ahead of the consumer PC market, as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category. Inventory levels remain normal. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and install base expansion. Patent licensing declined this quarter, driven by lower unit volume and revenue per unit. Our search business ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with improving profitability and continued growth in Bing from higher revenue per search and search volume. In our devices business, revenue declined 35%, down 34% in constant currency. Phone revenue declined 81%, and we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter. Surface revenue was down 2% and flat in constant currency, as we continued to phase out the Surface 3 device. Importantly, Surface gross margin dollars grew 6% and 17% in constant currency from an increasing mix of Pro 4 and Book replacing Surface 3 in the portfolio. In gaming, revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency due to lower console hardware pricing and Xbox 360 volumes. In this holiday quarter, as Satya mentioned, we reached an all-time high of active Xbox Live users, which helped to drive our gaming software and services revenue to 18% and 21% growth in constant currency. This marks our first $1 billion quarter of digital transactions for our gaming business through our Universal Store across Windows 10 and Xbox One. Segment gross margin percentage and dollars both increased this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 3% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage expanded with the continued shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined by 12%, also 12% in constant currency, from lower phone expense, a one-time legal settlement, and reduced marketing spend. Growth from Windows 10, the shift toward higher gross margin products and services in devices and gaming, and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33% and 37% in constant currency. Now back to our overall company results, we invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of capital leases, as we continued to support customer and partner demand across our commercial and consumer services. During the quarter, other income and expense was $186 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. We returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, completing our prior $40 billion share repurchase program this quarter, as we committed. Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX. We had originally expected FX rates to lessen going into H2. However, given current rates, we expect continued currency headwinds for the rest of the year. For Q3, we now expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing. In Q4, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on total revenue, 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Second, our commercial business, we expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth as we expand our install base, grow consumption, and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud. Third, CapEx, we will continue to meet customer demand by expanding data center capacity while driving efficiencies through new technologies. With the addition of LinkedIn, we expect our capital expenditures, including capital leases, to grow sequentially to support a broader portfolio. For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year. Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion. This reflects the continued annuity shift to the cloud with Office 365, Dynamics double-digit billings growth, and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services revenue should decline again due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. And in More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.35 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate revenue growth will exceed the overall PC market. Continued growth in Pro, driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10, should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market, with some additional benefit coming from the prior-year inventory build. Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market due to strength in the premium device category. In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2. As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we've passed the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated change in revenue recognition. And in Gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing balanced by higher engagement, usage, and transaction volume. In Devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone. Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book. We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses. LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. Other income and expense should be $150 million. We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests. Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our BUILD Developer Conference in May here in Seattle. We will share more details as we get closer to the date. Chris, let's move to Q&A.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of today's call. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent, very nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question about LinkedIn and what our expectation should be for achieving revenue synergies on LinkedIn. It seems like there's a lot of really interesting things you can do with that asset in combining it with your own portfolio. And how should we think about the potential for achieving some expense synergies? Obviously, there's a big cloud base that you could utilize under their assets, and Amy, you've always been very good at keeping expenses very well managed. So just as we go forward past the forward quarter, how should we think about the timeframe for achieving those benefits?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Amy to talk about the specifics of the synergies. The core focus, Keith, for us to start with is to ensure that the innovation roadmap we have is all driving member value. The core ethos of LinkedIn needs be about member-first. How do we increase the engagement on the mobile flagship application as well as the revamped desktop experience that's now rolling out? We think that's at the core of being able to in fact then have all of the revenue \u2013 have revenue growth in their business solutions with across higher market sell. So that's how I see it. It's a two-sided market which starts with the health (35:02) of membership and member engagement. And that is where the product roadmap, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, we'll be staying focused on it. We expect to see that roll out pretty rapidly. And as far as the guidance we have given at close in terms of what to expect, for example around EPS impact, those are things that we'll stay committed to. And I'll let Amy add more to it.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah, I think Satya is correct. The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on \u2013 excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses. As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue. So the in-quarter revenue and the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses, which will also hit. We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Keith. We'll move to the next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. There are a number of investors that had been wondering about the sales reorg that takes place February 1. Perhaps this has been a worry that's been overstated. Can you just give us a sense? Are there changes that are happening that will take place February 1 that are different, or is this a minor tweak to the go-to-market going forward?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I can comment on it. I'm not particularly sure exactly what's happening on February 1. I would say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for I would say the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model, where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the front-line sellers so that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists. Because it's super-important for us in this phase when people are looking for solutions to help them visually transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales, and that's the transformation. And so we have really reorganized ourselves, both in the headquarters and in the field, to be able to recognize that shift. What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore, and that's a pretty fundamental change. It's by consumption of cloud capacity in many cases. And this is happening all over the world. So that's the transformation that you will increasingly see us push forward, and no status quo on any part of Microsoft's organization should be counted on. If anything, we'll push to make sure that we are addressing what is our growth opportunities pretty aggressively.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think, Brent, in terms of there being a date, a very particular date, this is something, to Satya's point, we've been doing in a step function improvement over time for the past couple years, and we'll continue to do it. And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business. In fact, in some ways, it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas. So I think that's how I tend to look at it.\nBrent Thill - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Brent. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure gross margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us. I guess given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative? And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS, what you can back into from the financials of AWS? Can you walk us through the puts and takes? And then once you hit that scale point, is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly? Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 365, as well as our Azure core and premium services. And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud. It benefits margin, not just in Azure but across actually the entirety of the cloud. That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected. But I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety. But I do respect people always wonder, so I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure specifically.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you. Thanks, Heather. We'll take the next call, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Amy, I'm going to ask another question on gross margins, but this time at the Microsoft level. So your prior guidance was for ex-LinkedIn fiscal 2017 gross margins to be down 100 basis points. So the quarter you just posted gross margins ex-LinkedIn were actually up. And if I ran the math accurately, it looks like for your March quarter ex-LinkedIn, you're expecting gross margins to be about flat. So it feels like you're outperforming the core Microsoft gross margin guidance you gave before. So are you sticking with the down 100 basis points or has that improved? And if it has, what are the one or two biggest drivers of the gross margins feeling a little bit better ex-LinkedIn? Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Karl. I am sticking with it being about a point. That's the guidance we gave. And even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it's about a point. So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it. Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business. And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows. That tends to have a very good margin profile. And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve. And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile. So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year. But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Amy.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Karl, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking the question. So, Amy, the on-premise Server & Tools business grew 5%, 7% in constant currency. It was obviously helped by Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016. How should we think about on a longer-term horizon over the next 12 months or even longer how those two should help on the on-premise license or annuity business, on the cloud in Azure? How should we think about the impact of that? Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying it's why we tend to focus all up at that server products and services KPI being double digits generally an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the on-prem business. But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter, and then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward. We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year. That value prop is resonating. We saw some growth. I feel very good about that. And so I do think that can have an impact in H2. You heard me talk a little bit about it. With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us. It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2. And so it will be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide. But I would reiterate the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent, thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Mark.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you can talk about \u2013 we're still seeing the majority or really all the growth in operating profits come from MPC on a year-over-year basis. And I'm wondering how we should think about the factors impacting and the timing in the handoff of profit growth from MPC to IC and PBP, if that's something that you expect. What are the factors and timing there?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn. So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth. But the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition and IC. The way I think about it, we really \u2013 Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago \u2013 it's been a little longer than that now, to over-index on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud. We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition cost. We invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities and our sales force. We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers. That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number. And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts. A lot of that account value frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue. Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be. And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have. And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making. It's starting to pivot to consumed. It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet. But I think you're right. We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. People often think we focus on cut here, add here. It's also about, are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful? And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, whether it's how we build products. And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I think Amy described it well in answering the very specific technical question about segment reporting and the margins in it. But architecturally, some of the examples I used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. In many cases, it starts with advanced set protection of Windows 10 estate. And then how does that relate to Office 365? How does that relate to Azure Active Directory? And then the workloads that they want to put, which are Tier 1 workloads in Azure. It's very similar to what happened even in the client server era, but of course the starting points and how this progresses is very different. So we are always thinking at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique and differentiated spanning all of it. And so I don't think of it as margin shifts across the segments, and that's why we think of all of this as one digital estate at least from a customer-end perspective.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Walter. We'll go the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, thank you. Satya, I'm wondering what you think would be required to extend the hyper-growth trajectory for Azure into the future. For example, are there incremental waves of activity on the horizon that you would tie to Tier 1 workloads or large data center migrations or serverless usage which would enable that? And separate from that, Amy, I'm curious just philosophically. How do you plan to handle price cuts for compute and storage when they occur? Do you think you're better off matching them, exceeding them, or does it make sense perhaps warranting a premium in many cases due to the differentiated IP that you have up the stack?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah, let me start. Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. Even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example. For example, in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a PaaS service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale, that's a place where we are seeing in fact activity, whether it's game development or trading applications. We are seeing even interesting use cases of Azure functions, which is completely serverless. In fact, you can think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about being very, very smart about cloud consumption. Going serverless is something that we in fact advocate. So across the board, I feel we have the right mix of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and per user SaaS services like Azure Active Directory, which gives us the right mix to be able to even have the right margins long term. We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design because our vision has always been that we want to of course offer all of these layers, and customers will choose depending on their needs and their scenarios. And we are now seeing even a single customer estate spanning all of these.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors. But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate. And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core.\nMark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, congrats on finishing up a great quarter as well. One for you, Amy, and one for you, Satya. One, Amy, when I look at your comments on gross margin, clearly you're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin. But I'm wondering if we can take a composite of (52:37) your commercial cloud. Targets are about $20 billion. So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best-of-breed companies, I could get about 70% \u2013 75% gross margin when you hit your targets. I'm curious what you think about that. Is that too aggressive or within the ballpark? And for you, Satya, as cloud computing moves to the enterprise, there's some belief among investors that AWS is going be a big, strong competitor in the enterprise, which is typically not a stronghold for them. How do we think of Microsoft's enduring strength in the enterprise? And how confident can we be that you should be able to capture your fair share of enterprise workloads as they move to the cloud? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Let me start with the second part, and then you can add.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Yes.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: So, Kash, the way I think about it is, even in the client server era, we had tough competition. We had Oracle. We had VMware, and we had many other players we competed with and I grew up competing with. And we now have AWS I think who is going to be a credible competitor. So I feel that, as I said, we have a cloud strategy that is not just about infrastructure. It is about really SaaS and infrastructure. And we want to uniquely think about what are the things that we can do to differentiate and add value to our customers' digital estate in the cloud in that context. And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from by competing hard where we have to but also mostly thinking about differentiation.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications. And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution. The margins weren't as high either. And so I do think it will be a blend of those. But certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thank you, Kash. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Just wanted to focus back in on Office 365 on the commercial front. You had another strong quarter of revenue growth obviously at 49% constant currency, but it continues to meaningfully outpace the seat growth, which is still strong, about 37%. So that commentary that you all had given about premium mix in the past, two questions here. First to Satya, when you think about where we are in the progression, call it up to E5 so to speak or E3, how do you think this plays out? And how do you think about the mix of unit growth versus that premium mix and translating it to revenue? And then to Amy, I guess I'd argue that maybe we've done the low margin or low gross margin parts of the Office 365 transition. And now as this mix goes up, you're actually not just increasing revenue, but the margin is better too. Is that fair? And then how do you tie that back to your commercial cloud gross margin expectations long term?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. I can start. On the product side, we think of actually three things we are trying to do on a continuous basis in Office 365. First, even for the customers who are already on Office 365 at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity. So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. And so we focus quite a bit on adding additional value even to the existing licensing levels and increasing intensity of usage. Then things like what we are doing to even go to non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling for example. That's a way to expand seats even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker. Of course, we have significant more opportunity in small and medium sized businesses, although we have had good healthy growth there. I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. Those are all opportunities ahead. And then the last one of course is the new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security. So all those three dimensions, there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what's happening. But in terms of our investments in that core product value, it is actually happening on all those three.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. Transitions take time. And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice. But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3. And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads. And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Great, thank you, Phil. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillian with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much and congratulations from me as well, two questions, one for Amy first. When we look at CapEx, it actually declined year over year ex-capital leases, but even with capital leases the growth rate decelerated. And for the full year, it's obviously a pretty wide range, roughly zero to 40% growth. I'm just curious, Amy. With LinkedIn, have you made any changes to your CapEx assumptions for core Microsoft? And I guess I'm pointing to the fact that it did seem to decelerate quite a lot this quarter. And I wondered if there's any additional color you could frame around the growth rate for all-up CapEx plus capital leases. Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously. I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer. I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful. I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter, and it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn. Our real goal for LinkedIn is \u2013 over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets. But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure. So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Ross.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: We'll have time for one more question, please, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and congratulations as well. I wanted to ask on Windows 10. Satya, you talked at the beginning about customers starting to adopt it, and you mentioned three large ones already. Can you talk a little bit about that cycle and how you see everything that's unfolding and what the customer feedback is in terms of their intention to adopt it now versus waiting for a little bit? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows, and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows, and that's what's been the driver. But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service. We're increasingly seeing that resonate, not just in small business and some of the high-tech industry as it has been in the past, but now even in the regulated parts of the enterprise. So we are very excited about that. The other piece also that's driving is hardware innovation by the entire ecosystem. In fact, the work that we did with the Surface line has really stimulated the entire ecosystem to do some of the best innovative work, and you saw that even at CES. And the enterprise adoption of these new devices is also driving the overall excitement around Windows 10 and Windows 10 innovation.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Raimo. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast, and you can follow our comments at the Microsoft Investor Relations website.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you Chris and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I will share the results for the first quarter and discussed how we are innovating into growing each of our segments. Overall we are off to a good start in FY '17. We delivered $22.3 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% in constant currency. I am proud of the continued progress. Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation outcomes for both people and organizations. At our IT conference Ignite, I talked about how we are innovating in AI across the entire text back and how I will be infused into everything we do. To accelerate our innovation we've created a dedicated organization to focus on artificial intelligence. As I turned to progress we made by segment this quarter, I will highlight how these investments we're making in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions. Let's start with productivity and business process. We're helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar office apps they use every day. We recently introduced cloud power intelligence within Word, Excel, PowerPoint and outlook that uses machine learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate related content and connections focus your inbox and more easily create compelling content. We are also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers. This quarter we announced Office 365 threat intelligence which analyzes billions of signals across office Azure Windows and external data sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments. We're extending intelligence to compliance with our new data governance service which helps customers achieve organizational compliance and automate data retention. These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen security for Office 365 customers. We\u2019re seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises, small business and consumers. Monthly active users of Office 365 commercial are now over 85 million, up more than 40% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial seats were also up 40% year-over-year and revenue up 54% in constant currency. Across industries, customers such as eBay, European airline, jet, global pharmaceutical company, Allergan, the Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure. Customers love the power of office on any device. We now have more than 45 million outlook monthly active devices on iOS and android more than 70% increase year-over-year. Last week we unveiled a new class of purpose built intelligent apps in Dynamics 365 designed to remove any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration and business process. Using advanced analytics a machine learning, these new apps glean insights from previously siloed data to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing and customer service. They monitor customer relationship help, reveal connections, forecast demand and predict risk and the deep integration with Office 365 makes it easy to take action communicate and collaborate in real time or schedule a follow up. Our innovations the Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum, dynamics online paid seats more than doubled year-over-year and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions with more than 70% of the new dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing dynamics online. Companies like HP, Inc. are replacing their existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence and our latest release and transforming engagement with customers and partners. Overall, we are well positioned to compete and grow our Sarah in this large and growing market. Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Customers continue to choose the Microsoft cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 million in fiscal year 2018. Once enterprise customers choose one of our cloud services they continue to adopt more services. More than 60% of the fortune 500 now have at least three of our cloud offerings, up 20 points year-over-year. And as with last quarter, we continue to grow our commercial annuity mix which is now at 88%. Customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They wanted trusted global hyper scale cloud provider to meet the enterprise grade needs, they want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyper scale service and the cloud servers, they want higher level services to help them build their own digital capability inclusive of DevOps, productivity, new IOT and enterprise app development, advanced analytics and machine learning in AI capability. These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth. As revenue once again through to build it just wanted to 21% in constant currency with Azure compete usage more than doubling year-over-year. We continue to invest in and expand our data center footprint which now totals 38 regions including the announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. Enterprises like Nissan alliance, hotels, as well as public sector customers such as the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, the islands, health services executive are choosing brand tends to transform their organizations while meeting European data sovereignty security and compliance needs. Security and compliance remain paramount for enterprise customers. Azure is already the most trusted most compliant cloud with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider and our US government cloud has the highest number of certifications and dedicated data center regions in the industry to meet the stringent requirements of our public sector customers. We are applying AIT security with the new Azure security Center which leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to detect threats and help enterprise customers respond with comprehensive cyber security and management. Looking beyond infrastructure services, across industries customers like trucks North America, and are using Azure intelligence services to build powerful new offerings for their customers. More than half of the fortune 500 have our enterprise mobility services up more than 20 points year-over-year. This quarter we released a premium version of our enterprise mobility service that includes advanced security management for SaaS applications, automatic document classification and encryption, advanced identity protection, and we crossed three quarters of 1 billion unique user identities in Azure active directory. This quarter we announced a number of key partnerships. Adobe and as a be recognized Azure's leadership in the cloud on bringing their industry leading marketing and human resource solutions to our platform, giving our mutual customers powerful new ways to transform their business. Customers and developers are also choosing Azure for its openness. Enabling digital transformation for everyone means supporting the widest range of platform frameworks and tools. This quarter we announced that we are open source Windows power shall, our industry-leading infrastructure management tool and made it available on Linux. We continue to see strong interest in the previous post SQL Server with 19,000 customers registered including more than half of the fortune 500. It's opening conversations with customers spanning their entire data state both on premise and in the cloud. Azure fabric on Linux enables to high skill microservices and cloud applications. And we announced that our new power platform in Azure capable of extra scale compute will support Caf\u00e9, torch and our own frameworks for deep learning.  Finally, we're building our server products to become the edge of our cloud to support true hybrid computing. The new Windows server 2015 gives IT professionals new layers of security and brings Azure inspired innovation for infrastructure and cloud applications. And we expanded our partnership with doctor to make the commercially supported Docker engine available to Windows 2016 customers at no additional cost. Now let's talk about more computing were very also seeing intelligence transform Windows 10 and our ecosystem of devices. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200,000,000,000 hours of usage. And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and an area such as gaming. Last quarter I outlined three aspects of our Windows strategy. First deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform. Third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me talk to the progress we're making in each. This quarter we release Windows 10 anniversary update with advanced security features including Windows defender, threat protection, our cloud enabled service that helps enterprise detect, investigate and respond to advance networking tax. And with threat intelligence sharing capabilities we enable IT to investigate and respond to security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365. Our advancements in security helped to drive by three times at present Windows enterprise deployments over the last six months. The growth and customer option is also driving increased developers search and Cortana engagement. The number of developers building and updating universal Windows apps is up three times year-over-year, more than 1000 application of been developed using the Cortana API and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million monthly active users with almost 13,000,000,000 questions asked to date. Gaming is a leading driver of engagement on Windows 10 and opens up new experience it and scenarios across Windows devices. For the past three consecutive months Xbox one has been the number one selling console in the United States, giving a strong momentum heading into the holiday season. Our highly engage Xbox live database continues to grow across Windows 10 IOS and android up 21% year-over-year, and we have more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets, more than 500% increase year-over-year. Our commitment to grow Xbox live community led us to acquire beam this quarter, and innovative and interactive live streaming service that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time. Finally, let's talk about her progress in new device categories. Surface continues to drive category growth and more commercial customers are choosing to deploy service with the deals of 500 devices or more increasing 70% year-over-year and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. The Windows holographic platform and Microsoft Hololens are opening up new differentiated opportunities on Windows. This quarter we made Microsoft Hololens development edition available to all developers and business customers in the US and Canada and last week we expanded our presence to six additional markets. Enterprise customers like Volvo, Japan Airlines and the PGA tour, all embracing Microsoft Hololens to transform the way they work and create new mixed reality experiences for customers. It's still early, but it's great to see the innovation and creativity that developers are bringing to the platform and coming in 2017 we will enable our hardware partners to deliver entirely new mixed reality experiences with Windows holographic and on Windows 10. In closing, we are leading digital transformation across all industries and geographies. Creating enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. As we infuse AI into all of our computing platforms and experiences, we will drive even greater transformational value for our customers. In the coming weeks, I'm looking forward to sharing news about our new innovation in Windows 10 and Office 365. Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $22.3 billion up 3% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat and up 2% in constant currency. Operating income was flat and grew 4% in constant currency and earnings per share was $0.76, increasing 9% or 13% in constant currency. I'm pleased with the strong execution was on the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem. Across both our commercial and consumer businesses. Across most markets our results were in line with microeconomic trends. With strength in key markets like the US, Western Europe and Japan. Momentum and cloud services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88%, up two points from the prior year. We again saw higher than expected transactional deal volume, primarily driven by office commercial products and our small and midsize business segment. This quarter the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than the prior year, and was solid renewals from that base, we grew our commercial bookings by 18%. The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than 25 The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than $25.5 billion. Strong execution resulted in better than expected commercial revenue of $22.3 million or an 8% increase in constant currency. Our commercial cloud revenue run rate exceeded $13 billion this quarter, growing 59%. As I assure previously, we expect our commercial cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the year. This quarter our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 49%, up seven points sequentially, although we do expect variability from quarter to quarter. Importantly, gross margin dollars grew by 61% across the total commercial cloud.  Now the company gross margin. Our company gross margin was approximately 65%, down a little less than two points from the prior year, impacted by an increasing mix of commercial cloud revenue, slightly offset by improvements in more personal computing. The revenue performance in more personal computing largely drove COGS above our expectations. This quarter the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a two point negative impact on productivity and business processes and Intelligent Cloud results, and a one point negative impact on more personal computing results. Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1% in constant currency from investment supporting our commercial cloud. At the company level, operating income grew 4% in constant currency. Let's turn to each segment where we can now discuss constant currency impacted the revenue and operating income levels. This quarter our productivity and business processes segment delivered results above our expectations with approximately $6.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% and 8% in constant currency. In office commercial revenue increased by 5% and 8% in constant currency as Office 365 growth continued to outpace the shift from our on premise business. We again grew our install base across all the workloads. In our Office 365 commercial business are premium workload mix was above 60%. As mentioned earlier, our transactional results were higher than expected in the small and mid-size customer and segment and benefited from a stabilizing commercial PC market. Office consumer revenue grew 8% also a percent in constant currency benefited from a stronger than expected consumer PC market. Subscriber fee growth and recurring subscription revenue and our dynamics business grew 11% up 13% in constant currency as customer preference for cloud services and CRM online and dynamic the X the timber the two billings and seat growth. Segment gross margin dollars were flat up 2% in constant currency. Segment gross margin percentage declined on an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expenses grew 2%, also 2% in constant currency primarily driven by investments in cloud engineering. Operating income declined slightly but was up 2% in constant currency. Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $6.4 billion in revenue above our expectations and grew 10% or 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 11% and 13% in constant currency. Demand for our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on premise server business. Server premium products grew double digits in constant currency. As expected, enterprise services revenue growth slowed this 12.45% and 2% in constant currency, largely due to a decrease in volume of support agreements associated with Windows server 2003 and support. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency and segment gross margin percentage declined primarily due to increase in cloud revenue mix, partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Given the growth opportunity in cloud, we increased our operating expenses by 21%, also 21% in constant currency to fund cloud engineering, sales capacity and developer engagement. Consequently, operating income declined 14% and 11% in constant currency.  Now to our final segment, more personal computing. Revenue was $9.3 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency and better than expected across multiple businesses. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business was flat this quarter were in line with the PC market and better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue grew 1%, reflecting the stabilizing commercial PC market, particularly in the US. OEM non-Pro revenue declined by 1%, slightly ahead of the consumer PC market driven by a higher mix of premium devices. Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels. We're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 deployments. The annuity portion of our Windows commercial business grew again in constant currency as customers continue to commit to our differentiated security and management solutions.  Overall, our total Windows commercial business revenue across small and mid-size businesses enterprises and academic institutions was flat and grew 2% year-over-year in constant currency. Patent licensing revenue increased this quarter, primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements. Our search business grew again this quarter driven by rate and volume improvements in being. The our growth rate is moderated we continue to gain share and scale while delivering profit. As expected, devices revenue declined this quarter. Revenue decreased 27% down 25% in constant currency due to a revenue declined 72% to 71% in constant currency. Surface revenue increased 38% 39% in constant currency driven by year-over-year growth for surface Pro and bulk which launched in Q2 of the prior year. In gaming revenue decline 5% or 4% in constant currency, due to lower console hardware revenue. We continue to see strong engagement on our platform with monthly active Xbox live users up 21%. Our software and services revenue from console, PC in other gaming devices grew 6% or 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars.1% up 1% in constant currency as decreases due to Xbox consoles and phone were partially offset by our search and surface results. Segment gross margin percentage improved slightly given the revenue shift to higher margin products and services. Operating expenses decreased 13% also 13% in constant currency primarily based on reduced phone spend and lower marketing spend resulting in segment operating income growth of 26% and 31% in constant currency.  Now back to our company results. We invested $2.3 billion in capital expenditures, a decline from Q4 but consistent with our plan for investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer cloud services. During the quarter we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio which resulted in other income and expense of $100 million from net recognized gains on investments in income from dividends and interest partially offset by interest expense. Our Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 70% this quarter. As I mentioned before, our income tax rate is impacted by three sectors. The proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity and our first quarter equity best impact of the REIT more significantly been in other quarters. We returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 8% to $.39. With that overview of the quarter, let's turn to the outlook. My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include LinkedIn. We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. Turning to FX, we expect one point of revenue impact of both the total company and individual segment levels. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy, but we will still see and experience variability our transactional business. We were also see strong annuity growth driven by solid renewal execution and increasing customer adoption and use of our cloud services. Therefore, we expect commercial revenue to be within the region $21.05 billion to $21.25 billion. Next on CapEx, we will continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend. We expect the sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter. For the full year our total expected CapEx growth rate should be lower than FY '16 event efficiency improvements. Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment. In productivity and business processes we expect revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive install base growth with continuing declines in our transactional business. For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of 6.5 5 billion For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.55 billion to $6.75 million driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and cloud services. We anticipate the enterprise services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows server 2003 service agreement. We expect more personal computing revenue to be $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion. This segment is impacted by different trends in our other two segments so some additional detail. First on Windows. We expect our OEM business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned. As a reminder, our OEM Pro business we exited Q2 last year with a slightly higher level of inventory. We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel which will dampen year-over-year growth of it. In search we expect things revenue growth to be similar to Q1. Additionally, we expect that total search revenue growth will slow considerably as we pass the one year anniversary of our young to deal and the associated change in revenue recognition. Phone revenue will continue to decline and as we previously announced, we anticipate closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2. We expect surface revenue to decline as we anniversary the product launch from a year ago. And in gaming we expect strong share performance in key markets like the US and the UK this holiday, but overall revenue will decline given lower price points and lower overall console units as mix shift towards Xbox One and Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform given the holiday season. We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.85 billion and $7.95 billion in Q2, and we remain on path for full year operating expense of $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be $150 million as we continue to balance games on equity investments and income from interest and dividends against the interest expense in the net cost of hedging. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be 20% plus or minus two points with variability due to three factors discussed earlier. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks Amy. We will now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Satya on Azure the numbers were really impressive given how hard the comp was, I'm curious if you could just help out a little more color in terms of what you saw during the quarter and maybe how some of the ticket sizes or sizes these are signs changing from the past year ? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Overall, again I go back to how we think about Azure. We really have a view of distributed computing which is more expansive doing just even our HyperScale cloud. We think about Azure and our servers as one distributed computing fabric that\u2019s building. We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent, we think of them altogether building out our commercial cloud because it takes one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT but it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. They collect the data, they store the data, the analyze and do predictions on it but then after you do predictions you got to do something about the predictions. So in many cases they choose to use especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module automating field service. So it's those higher level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. This is a decision we made many, many years ago in some sense inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server area. I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. \nKeith Weiss: I want to drill in on Office 365 a little bit, 40% growth in commercial space is a really nice number but even nicer number on the revenue line I think 54% of constant currency growth in Office 365 commercial, that seems to imply you guys are seeing some nice ASP increase as the platform matures. Can you talk to us about where we are in that cycle of moving from a E1 to E3, is the E5 part of the equation yet? Are you guys actually moving there yet?\nAmy Hood: When I talk about the premium services mix, in our Office Commercial 365 business being about 60%, that is what's driving whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time. I don't really think about there being sort of a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage because part of it is as you know not just adding the first few in notes in E3 is continuing to add E5 and new scenarios over time that will continue to create. So hopefully that's helpful but you are right, it is ARPU driven the performance outside of the 40% growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. \nHeather Bellini: Satya I know that Brent asked you about Azure but I'm just wondering if you could share with us you mentioned that compute usage on Azure I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see coming pass [ph] coming along and where do you think we are in getting kind of the easier workloads to the cloud and are you now starting to see the inflection given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter where you are starting to see production significant production workloads that are on premise actually starting to move over as well?\nSatya Nadella: We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on premise, but I think the more interesting thing Heather for us is to see new workloads. When I look at what's happening with say some of the most innovative work we've done around distributed computing which is service fabric and how people are in fact going straight to building out using our past services some of the new HyperScale cloud services using microservices and not only are they doing that but we're also seeing great growth in our serverless infrastructure which is Azure functions. So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers so the much interesting thing that I am observing is that it could be the same model customer that was participating with us in the client server area. We are not just building or moving their IT but they are building new digital services for HyperScale and that's what it is probably unique in terms of what is changed year-over-year for us. It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore, it is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company and we are well positioned to serve them and that's good to see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Question for Amy. The operating cash flow generation $11.6 billion was extraordinary. I don't think you've had a 50% plus cash flow margin since early 2012. Is this a little bit of an anomaly may be driven by unearned revenues or is something changing in the business model that might change the rate of cash flow generation in coming quarters as well? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: It is actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is about a $1.3 billion on settled cash settlement impact. So you actually see that revert in Q2, although our free cash flow growth of 8% in the quarter was actually very good, and I do feel good about that, but I want to make sure you don't miss understand the root cause that makes the number a bit of an anomaly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: So want to drill in a little more. The margin for commercial cloud improved 7% which given the size is a large improvement. Can you give us some more details on what exactly is driving that margin improvement. You said it's going to be improving over the year, but how sustainable is that drive to improvement?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start market and then Amy you can add to it. Again Mark this goes back to a little bit of understanding I guess how we think about both X as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. The architectural design we have for example when we do X we are buying the four everything that Microsoft does which is everything from Azure to Office 3652 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services like Xbox live. And you see the growth that we talked about across all of this. Then we have a very common platform both for first party workloads as well as our third party business. And so then as we drive efficiency and our cloud infrastructure, when we for example use to be more out of our network, that's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost and gross margin that spans everything that we do. Then also what we think about as the mix our goal is not just to sell commodity services, but to actually use commodity services in some cases as a bootstrap for higher level services because of things like data gravity. So there will be differences quarter to quarter. We may impact on board a few customers who first on board a lot of storage at commodity service levels, and then later on start some of the high level services. So the margin improvement on a lot over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see, but from quarter to quarter there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we're building. We're not just building Azure we're building from 13 Office 365 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services withdrawal cloud oriented and it's a combination of that that's driving margin, but Amy I will let you add there.\nAmy Hood: But I would say in terms of sustainability are quarter to quarter, Satya is right. There is going to be very ability the variability is really two things. One is the case of the mix shift to Azure as it grows at the pace we're seeing it does impact quarter to quarter. The overall commercial cloud revenue mix, but I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin for example which recent significantly improved we expect to continue. Certainly over the course of this year as we have discussed. So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct and I think the variability can certainly occur from any of the reasons Satya talked about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter Pritchard: I think Amy am wondering on the segment operating margins guided those per se, but you have sort of flat performance in operating income in an declines in IC with growth in do you expect to see as you get towards the end of the year that the enterprise cloud segments move positive and MPC is not as much of a driver how should we think about the evolution of the product contributions of the over the year?\nAmy Hood: Sure. I am actually going to cover in commercial segments as one because really when you think about the commercial cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions which include dynamics and office plus some components of Azure which is I think really the trend you'll see us talk about from here on out. So what I would say is, he will continue to see us focus on gross margin improvement and we talked about that. You also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales capacity as well. So I think we have pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. He will continue to see us do that. But we also expect revenue growth in gross margin growth to come out of that investment. So I do believe that's a continued pace you will see us on, and we feel good about the ROI of the investments we have made especially in those commercial segments. In MPC, I generally expect he will continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year, that's not new. Use all the same mechanism last year through the year. As we pivot from our phone business to some of our higher margin product. And so, I suspect you will see a similar pattern on a similar desire by Satya to continue to invest toward growth especially on the commercial side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy : So Amy, you are reporting an impressive buildup of the long term deferred revenue itself 162% year-over-year. At the same time, some of your partners feel that you are gradually doing away with a three year that have existed for so long at that you are replacing them with the vehicle which is a little more flexible in terms of length of contract in there could be some shorter lengths. Could you help us in terms of how to think through the long term deferred revenue buildup as you do start to mix over to the MPSA?\nAmy Hood: Let me break report that long term earned balance a bit. I do really focused and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. Our overall long term under imbalance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past. And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seen the underlying trends. That being said, our commercial under balance is seeing good growth I'm proud of our performance this quarter. Both sequentially and year-over-year. If you think about any change we're making or not, in our partner agreements our customer agreements. We still do generally rely the vast majority on three year agreements so whether or not the term were to change, given how we recognize revenue, I will you know if it's going to be material and I do not expect the change are talking about to be material in any way on the commercial unearned balance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Quick question more on an industry theme for Satya. We obviously saw a very interesting answer from AWS and [indiscernible] which kind of seems to suggest a hybrid cloud is the way forward [indiscernible] has to react. Can you talk a little bit about your customer feedback around the hybrid cloud offering from you and how your customer is thinking about that working with you together? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: I spoke to this a little earlier because from day one we have this vision of how we want to build for the future distributed computing would include our hyper scale cloud service which is Azure an impact Azure is built on Hyper-V and we always said that we were going to build our server as the edge of our hyper scale cloud and so that's what Windows Server 2016 represents, that\u2019s what SQL Server 2016 represents and so we have this unique capabilities like be able to stretch even a single table in a database in SQL 2016 all the way to the cloud for having infinite table capacity and then having your apps and queries work. How we're doing containers for example in Windows Server 2016 we have great container support as well as support for things like our service fabric so that people can have absolute application portability and in fact people can even [indiscernible] applications. We have many customers who tier their storage and compute across a hybrid backplane. So this is an architectural design point that we have built from the ground up from day one and it's good to see people validating it now and elsewhere and we will take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please proceed. \nUnidentified Analyst: Can you just compare and contrast AWS versus Azure versus AWS for me standpoint of the technology footprint that you are offering both these companies? And Amy if you could just comment on the margin structure of your business trip of the business relative to AWS and if you have time talk about the Windows 10 cycle. Why hasn't got to be the best Windows 10 cycle for the enterprise compared to the previous cycle thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: I would say I talked about sort of the reasons the three big reasons why customers choose our cloud in our cloud infrastructure in particular. One, it is about the hybrid design point that is at the core of how we are billed, both Azure as well as our servers. It is because of the higher level services that we have. It is also because of the design point we have around not just Azure but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and the extensibility of our cloud services across all three of them, and that's really the fundamental reasons why customers choose us. The other thing I will mention is, we have more of a commitment I would say which is been there from a long time to build out a global footprint with more regions and anyone. We are more certifications than anyone in terms of adhering to both regulated industry as well as digital sovereignty. We've done many things we're the only cloud provider for example that operates in China. We operate in Germany under German law. And that matters to multinational companies but also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions. So those are our core attributes that are driving our growth and will continue to stay focused on them.\nAmy Hood: In terms of the gross margin question, I feel very good talk about this quarter about our improvement year-over-year and remain confident that we are heading in the right direction and so, I think when you think about that plus the rest of our offerings, I think we're pretty confident. I will take the opportunity and asked about Windows 10 in the enterprise market that we are encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof of concepts, and actually some of the stability we've seen in the commercial PC market in terms of starting to see some so I think overall I think we will continue to watch, but our security and management value prop I think really is paying off.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. \nRoss MacMillan: Satya, I actually had a question for you on SQL server as you think about the port to Linux, what if you can provide an update on two things, one, it's just the timing of when we should see that in market and then two, are there other things you need to do to meet that requirement across the landscape. So for example, you have to think about supporting Java runtimes inside of SQL server moving a little bit away from the traditional that development of armed. Just curious as to how your Dick about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems. Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux because the entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data as stated with customers. And to now be able to talk about the full SQL estate one of the other conversations that we are having is not just about SQL but our analytics and advanced analytics with where we've done some very, very compelling work again across Linux and Windows and then of course the cloud. So it's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud with things like Azure datalink that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and policy storage and processing capability they need. Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why for example on Azure itself Java is first class. We have Linux is first class. We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to, and that something that we stay very attuned to come out which is we are not trying to fight some old battles. This is all about being able to serve customers on their needs today and that's what is leading and driving a lot of our choices as well as how we think about our market opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Please proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: Satya your make a much bigger bet on AI and rightfully so and you highlighted some very interesting use cases having said that, Microsoft has worked on AI project for quite some time. So can you help us understand what degree of positive change you think will come from the combined group 8 you have recently formed including when you think material AI benefits will become truly ingrained in the customer's workflows and then secondly how should we think about the incremental investment in AI going forward?\nSatya Nadella: Overall, I am thrilled about both the AI group that we have formed, the AI research and the heritage we have with them even this week I think we publicly are talking about setting the state-of-the-art when it comes to something like speech recognition and something that we did even with image net an image recognition and object. So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn into products. So the way to measure from the investment side is to see AI when it is infused into everything we do. Take Hololens, the ability of Hololens to be able to see the world, reconstructed and in that world to be able to superimpose holograms, that is AI applied AI that is working today. When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without between languages, it's using a deep neural net pens bring together speech synthesis, speech recognition and machine translation with Skype data, that is fairly magical. When you seeing capable of running flow to create intelligence, that is what we are using impact from our speech and vision work. That is AI as applied today. So I am not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI, we're very much going forward even the office tools example I used. They're all using AI today. The PowerPoint designer if you want the most practical use of it, even identify great PowerPoint slides now because of AI. And so, that's how I measure progress. We are committed to long-term research, but we're also very focused on having the long term research translated into everyday use products, and that's what you will see from us going forward.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed. \nBrad Reback: Amy quick question with the recent release of WinServer 16, is there any reason to think that we shouldn't see some uptick in the transactional business, especially with easing comps in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact. You should think about in the next couple of quarters. And our focus will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity and so we are really trying to get away from some of that launch impact that you may normally expect to see.\nChris Suh: So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person these event will be webcast and you can follow our comments at Microsoft investor relations website. Please contact us if you have any additional details if you need any additional details and thank you again for joining.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. I\u2019m proud of our strong results this quarter and even more proud of what we have accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered more than $110 billion in revenue for the full year with double digit topline and bottom line growth. And our commercial cloud business surpassed more than $23 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 57%. The strength of our results reflects accelerating innovation and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation. I shared our vision for the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge a little over a year ago, a vision that is now quickly becoming reality and impacting every customer in every industry. Everything we have accomplished this year has been about accelerating our lead in this new era and the tremendous opportunity ahead. We focused on the right secular technology trends and growing markets and followed that up with solid roadmap execution. We reorganized our engineering teams to break free of the categories of the past and better align with the emerging tech stack from silicon to AI to experiences, to better serve the needs of our customers today and long into the future. We reoriented our sales and marketing teams, adding industry and technical expertise to partner more deeply with our customers on their digital transformation journeys. And, most importantly, we drove innovation to deliver differentiated value across the cloud and the edge. Now, I\u2019ll briefly highlight some of our innovation and momentum. We introduced Microsoft 365 to empower employees in the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is now a multi-billion-dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and underpenetrated markets, including more than 2 billion first-line workers, and industry-specific workflows. Across Microsoft 365, we are helping people be more productive, collaborate and stay secure on any device with AI infused experiences they use every day, and it\u2019s driving usage. We have more than 135 million users of Office 365 commercial. Outlook mobile is being used on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices. And more than 200,000 organizations are using Microsoft Teams as the hub for teamwork. We invested to make Windows 10 the most modern, secure, always-up-to-date operating system. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices, and the growth of the enterprise deployments this year exceeded our expectations. It was a record year for LinkedIn, now with more than 575 million members and revenue growth of 37% in Q4, the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue acceleration. We saw record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter, with sessions growth up 41% year-over-year. This strong engagement is driven by quality of the feed, video, messaging and acceleration of mobile usage, with mobile sessions up more than 55% year-over-year. We will continue to invest to make LinkedIn the essential platform to connect the world\u2019s professionals and help them achieve more with experiences powered by LinkedIn and Microsoft graphs. Dynamics 365 gives organizations an alternative to monolithic, siloed suites of business applications with modular, modern, extensible, and AI-driven apps that unlock insights across every part of the organization, from sales to HR. It\u2019s gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, with revenue up 61% year-over-year. Our investments in Power BI, PowerApps and Flow as the new analytics and application platform are gaining significant momentum with ISVs and enterprise customers. Azure is the only hyper scale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, security and management, and our differentiated architectural approach drove another strong quarter of growth. We are investing aggressively to build Azure as the world\u2019s computer. We expanded our global datacenter footprint to 54 regions, more than any other cloud provider, and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the last year alone, focused on both existing workloads and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the Edge. We introduced Azure Stack and Azure Sphere, two first-of-their kind cloud-to-edge solutions that are already seeing strong customer demand. We are democratizing data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure ML, and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and experiences for competitive advantage. The world\u2019s leading companies are running on Azure, and I\u2019m especially proud that Walmart chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to accelerate its digital transformation for their associates and customers. In Gaming, we are pursuing our expansive opportunity from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed, surpassing $10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We are investing aggressively in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. The combination of Xbox Live, Game Pass subscriptions and Mixer are driving record levels of growth and engagement. Not only are we investing to grow organically but we are also investing inorganically in opportunities that expand our total addressable market and accrue value to our platforms and our customers. Take LinkedIn. We have united the world\u2019s leading professional cloud with the world\u2019s leading professional network and proved that we have an integration model that works, enabling LinkedIn to accelerate growth while retaining its member-first ethos. With GitHub, we recognized the increasingly vital role that developers play in value creation and growth in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. Our pending acquisition will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences, while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its independence and developer-first ethos and community. PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile, PC and console. And the addition of five new gaming studios bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services. Microsoft has always been a partner-led company, and partners increasingly see more opportunity on our platforms, inspiring leading companies like SAP, Adobe and GE, as well as fast-growing start-ups like InMobi to play an even larger role in our vibrant and growing partner ecosystem, an asset that gives us scale in this new era. In closing, our opportunity has never been greater. We will continue to innovate and invest across our solution areas in serving our customers and their unmet and unarticulated needs. With this tremendous opportunity comes great responsibility. We\u2019re relentlessly working to instill trust in technology across everything we do. It\u2019s why we will continue to lead the industry dialogue on trust, advocate for customer privacy, drive industry-wide cybersecurity initiatives, and champion ethical AI. Our investments and business model are fundamentally aligned with our customers\u2019 long-term interests and success. This opportunity and responsibility grounds us in our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. I\u2019m proud of our progress, and I\u2019m proud of the more than 100,000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused on our customers\u2019 success in this new era. Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $30.1 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Operating income increased 30% and 24% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $1.13, increasing 7% and 3% in constant currency. As a reminder, FY17 included a $1.8 billion tax benefit related to previously non-deductible phone losses. In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results. We saw strong performance in most of our geographic regions against a backdrop of favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive IT spending trends. Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to increase. In FY18, we closed a record number of multi-million-dollar commercial cloud agreements and more than doubled the number of $10 million-plus Azure agreements. Our annuity mix increased 3 points year-over-year to 89%. As a result, commercial bookings increased 18% even with a strong prior year comparable. Commercial unearned revenue was $29 billion, growing 23% and 21% in constant currency, significantly higher than anticipated due to stronger than expected cloud billings. Our commercial cloud revenue was $6.9 billion, growing 53% and 50% in constant currency with strong performance across the U.S., Western Europe, and the UK. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points to 58%. In line with our commitment at the beginning of the year, we improved the gross margin percentage in each cloud service, with Azure seeing the most significant improvement. Our company gross margin percentage was 68%, ahead of our expectations, and up 1 point year-over-year from improvement in our More Personal Computing segment, driven by Surface. FX increased revenue growth by 2 points, 1 point lower than anticipated, due to a stronger U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a positive impact of 3 points on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing revenue. The FX impact to COGS was immaterial. This quarter, operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, above our expectations due to revenue driven expense, such as sales compensation given the strength of the quarter, and severance expense, primarily in our sales organizations, offset by FX favorability. Strong revenue growth, improved device gross margin percentage, and continued targeted investment in cloud engineering, cloud sales capacity, and LinkedIn created operating income leverage. This quarter, operating income increased again, up 3 points year-over-year. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.7 billion, increasing 13% and 10% in constant currency, in line with our expectations even with the headwinds from a stronger dollar and a higher than anticipated mix of cloud billings in our Office commercial and Dynamics businesses during the quarter. As a reminder, under ASC 606, cloud revenue is ratably recognized while annuity on-premises revenue has a component of upfront recognition. A higher mix of cloud billings is reflected in more unearned revenue and less in-period recognition in a quarter. Office commercial revenue increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 38% and 35% in constant currency and Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%. We continued to see healthy installed base growth and ARPU expansion from customer adoption of premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office consumer revenue increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in the subscriber base, now at 31.4 million. Our Dynamics business grew 11% and 8% in constant currency, with double digit billings growth. Dynamics 365 grew 61% and 56% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 34% in constant currency with strong execution across all businesses. As Satya highlighted, engagement continued to accelerate, and we also saw record levels of job postings, benefitting from a robust U.S. job market. Segment gross margin dollars grew 13% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year even as cloud mix increased, driven by margin expansion in Office 365 and LinkedIn. Operating expenses increased 7% as we continued to invest in LinkedIn, cloud engineering, and commercial sales capacity. Operating income increased 20% and 13% in constant currency. Revenue from the Intelligent Cloud segment was $9.6 billion, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency, with better than expected results in both our on-premises and Azure businesses. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 89% and 85% in constant currency. Azure per user services performed ahead of expectations with our Enterprise Mobility installed base growing 55% year-over-year to over 82 million. Our on-premises server business grew 8% and 6% in constant currency, with double digit growth in premium server products revenue and healthy renewals, benefiting from the significant value customers see in our hybrid solutions. Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage was offset by a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 11% with ongoing investments in cloud engineering and sales capacity to support top-line growth. Operating income grew 34%, up 30% in constant currency. Finally, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.8 billion, up 17% and 16% in constant currency, with better than expected results in Windows commercial, OEM Pro, and Surface. In the commercial space, we saw an accelerating pace of Windows 10 enterprise deployments this quarter. Customer demand for modern and secure hardware and stronger than expected PC growth in geographies where Pro mix is high contributed to OEM revenue growth of 14%, ahead of the overall commercial market. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 23% and 19% in constant currency, driven by double digit billings growth as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In consumer, OEM Non-Pro revenue declined 3%, slightly below the consumer PC market, driven by continued pressure in entry-level price category, even as we continued to take share in the premium category. Inventory levels were within the normal range. Search revenue ex-TAC increased17% and 16% in constant currency driven by enhancements to our advertising platform and Bing volume growth across both U.S/ and international markets. Surface revenue increased 25% and 21% in constant currency, driven by strong performance of the latest editions in the portfolio against a low prior year comparable. In Gaming, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency. Xbox software and services grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, mainly from a third-party title. Xbox Live monthly active users increased 8% to 57 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 21% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased driven by new Surface editions, offset by sales mix to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, driven by seasonality changes in advertising spend versus the prior year and investments in engineering across Search and AI. Operating income grew 38% and 32% in constant currency. Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.1 billion and increased on a sequential basis, in line with expectations. Cash paid for property, plant, and equipment was $4 billion, reflecting investments to support growth in our cloud business as well as a $250 million real estate acquisition. Free cash flow was $7.4 billion and down 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business. Cash flow from operations grew 4% year-over-year and included tax payments related to the adoption of ASC 606 and TCJA, as well as an earlier start to the hardware inventory build for holiday than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of these items, operating cash flow grew approximately 13%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Other income and expense was approximately $300 million, lower than expected due to FX re-measurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18%, higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of our revenue. And finally, we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 16%. Our Q4 share repurchase was $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, but down sequentially, given the suspension of share repurchase activity in advance of the announced GitHub acquisition. Now, let\u2019s move to the outlook. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from GitHub which we still expect to close by the end of the calendar year. Overall, the key drivers and trends of our business for the next fiscal year remain largely unchanged from April and assume a consistent macro environment. First, on FX. Assuming that rates remain stable, we expect no impact to full year revenue growth, with any FX benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, our commercial business. Given corporate IT spend optimism, an increasing demand for cloud services, our strong competitive product position, and consistent sales execution, we expect another year of strong revenue growth and higher annuity mix across our commercial business. As customer commitment to our cloud increases, we are seeing larger and longer term agreements. As a result, we may see increased quarterly volatility in commercial bookings growth and commercial unearned revenue. Productivity and Business Processes should continue to grow double digits driven by Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Customer demand for our hybrid offerings should drive high-teens growth in our server products and cloud services revenue KPI. And in Azure specifically, we expect an increasing mix of IaaS and PaaS consumption-based revenue. In Windows, we expect strong business fundamentals in our OEM Pro and Windows commercial businesses, though the rates of revenue growth will slow through the year against a strong FY18 comparable. Third, commercial cloud gross margin percentage. We expect continued improvement in each commercial cloud service, as well as in the overall commercial cloud gross margin percentage. The rate of improvement will moderate relative to FY18 as revenue mix continues to shift to Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services, and we realize less year-over-year improvement in our per-user services. We will continue to increase our investments in CapEx to meet the growing demand for our cloud services, although we do expect the growth rate for the year to moderate. Next, operating expenses. Given our strong execution, we will continue to invest in the trends and growing markets we believe are fundamental to long-term shareholder value creation. Investment in commercial cloud, LinkedIn, gaming, and AI should result in operating expense growth of roughly 7%. Even with these strategic investments and the continued shift to our cloud businesses, we expect operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year. Other income and expense should be slightly negative, in line with prior guidance, and with quarterly variability primarily due to changes in FX remeasurement, interest rates, and valuation changes with the adoption of the new accounting rules for financial investments. And finally, tax rate. We\u2019ve refined our estimates of the impacts from TCJA, the mix of service versus license revenue, and the geographic mix of revenue and now expect our FY19 effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability. Now, to the outlook for our first quarter. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by approximately 1 point and decrease COGS and operating expenses by 1 point. Second, our commercial business. We expect another healthy quarter with commercial unearned revenue down approximately 10% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will improve slightly on a sequential basis. Third, we expect another quarter of sequential growth in capital expenditures as we continue to support growing, global customer demand. Now to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.25 billion and $9.45 billion, driven by double digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain high on a stronger prior year comparable. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.15 billion and $8.35 billion. Azure revenue growth should reflect a balance of continued strength in our IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and a moderating rate of growth in our per-user services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion to $10.25 billion. In OEM Pro, we expect revenue growth in line with the commercial PC market. And in OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics as seen in Q4. In Surface, we continue to expect strong performance from our latest editions, including the new Surface Go, to drive growth similar to Q1 of the prior year. Search ex-TAC should see another quarter of mid-teens growth with consistent execution against rate and volume growth opportunities. In Gaming, we expect mid-teens revenue growth with continued strong user engagement on our platform. The software and services growth rate will moderate due to strong third-party titles launched a year ago. We expect COGS of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and operating expenses of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be approximately negative $100 million. And finally, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year rate due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter. Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And congratulations on a really nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. I think growth overall in Azure this quarter is probably ahead of most peoples\u2019 expectations. And it sounds like the type of business that\u2019s being done on Azure is becoming more strategic and changing a little bit. So, Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit about the types of workloads, the type of sort of services that are being used on Azure, how that\u2019s evolved over the past year. And Amy, for you, maybe there is a new KPI, I believe. You gave us sort of the growth in the Enterprise Mobility of 55%. Was that in line with your expectations? Because I know you were sort of tempering our expectations on growth in that part of the business. Is that growing in line with kind of the slowdown you were expecting or is that better than you had imagined?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. So, let me -- first of all thanks Keith for the question. And so, let me start. Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it\u2019s been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate. So, that means there\u2019s a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud, people use both Azure Stack plus Azure. So, that continues to drive a lot of IaaS growth for us as people are sort of looking basically to lift and shift a lot of their current data center workloads. Then, on top of it, we even have modernization of apps that is accelerating. And that drives a lot of the higher level services, in particular our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute, but what happens is all this compute then requires storage and data, and that\u2019s another place where we see increasing acceleration. The one thing that I would say that I am increasingly seeing is Tier 1 workloads. In some sense, when you think about some of the commitments being made by some of the biggest brands in the world in terms of what they\u2019re doing, one, it\u2019s very core to their operation; and two, they are running it in the cloud. And so, that\u2019s one thing that definitely is a market difference for us.\nAmy Hood: And to your question on the per user services, specifically Enterprise Mobility, Keith, it was a bit better than I had anticipated in Q4. And really, driver of these per user services, such as EMS, actually is the value proposition that Satya refers to, and we refer to as Microsoft 365 and we saw strength broadly. And if you think about that, it\u2019s the Windows commercial, it\u2019s Office 365 commercial and EMS. And really that I think what we heard a lot was the value of the security and management continue to add more supported endpoints, offer really tremendous value to customers. And we did see a bit more strength than I was anticipating in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Amy, the commercial unearned revenue and bookings were again super strong, and evidently Microsoft is benefiting from fairly strong EA renewal activity. So, when you look out into fiscal \u201819, how would you compare the degree of renewal activity versus fiscal \u201818 and fiscal \u201817? It sounds like you\u2019re still constructive, but I\u2019d love to hear some color whether it feels as good as the fiscal year you just ended? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Let me break up that question a little bit, because you actually asked a couple of things that are important. Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you\u2019re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. But, there was also very good execution of adding new workloads, adding new opportunity in Q4, things such as Azure, as an example or Dynamics 365, as an example. So, really Q4 wasn\u2019t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value. So, when you look into \u201819, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value, new opportunity. And the third component of the question was really how did the renewal base correlate FY18? And the answer is, it\u2019s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini: I was wondering, Amy or Satya, if you can help us think about how Azure Hybrid Benefit has changed the type of net expansion rate, you are experiencing on your ELAs that come up for renewal? And I know you are kind of a little bit touching on that with Karl, but is there any way to help to think about how that in particular might be helping the expansion rates of those accounts? And can you help us to think about how this might be -- how that might be helping drive growth in your existing contracts? And then the other question would be. You've mentioned that you are moving some per user consumption that you are going to see more growth in consumption based services versus per user Azure workload growth. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering, if you could share with us, is there any gross margin impact there? Does one have higher gross margins than the other? Is there anything that we should be taking from how you are parsing those comments about how we think of Azure's gross margin progression going forward?\nSatya Nadella: So, on the first one, I actually think that these hybrid used benefits are being sort of best kept secrets. So, I\u2019m actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year, we do a much better job and customers do a much better job, but they don\u2019t benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid used benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal, and we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week just really making sure that everybody understand those benefits. So, I don\u2019t think that, that is really played out. If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth. But to your second question I\u2019ll even say the following which is that, I think that there is clearly difference in GM between the per user and consumption. But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms, there is the IR services, there is the data services, and some of the higher level services. Some of these IoT services now even have SaaS components to it. So, therefore, I think that the mix will be different by quarter-by-quarter, but increasingly our strategy is in many times to get our customers to get going with what is core storage or core compute, but then they scale into these higher levels of services.\nAmy Hood: And I\u2019d say, Heather, the two components just to add. The Azure has a benefit. I think we are starting, as Satya said, we started to see some impact from that in my opinion in Q4 in the on-prem KPI. But it really was more in Windows. And the value as we continue to see in SQL next year I do think there is some opportunity for customers to realize the real value from these hybrid benefits. And so -- as to add confidence to my high teens KPI growth for the year is that this is a very customer value oriented offer. To your question on GM, Satya has obviously correct on that one. And I\u2019d say the way we think about it is actually more -- we're talking about Azure per user, it really does move more with M365 per user. It's almost better to put that in your mind as behaving more and having more structures more like Office 365 and behaves quite similarly; tends to have good quarters, when we do good execution on Office 365, and so my comments were more and continue to be around having people understand that sales motion, and that it tends to move in that direction.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: So, I\u2019ve two related questions. And the first is, if you look at this quarter, the intelligent cloud revenue grew 23% and the gross margin dollars grew the same 23%, given the SaaS growing lower margin Azure business, we\u2019re not seeing any longer negative margin impact. Have you reached the point where the incremental dollar for Azure revenue is closed to the overall intelligent cloud margin? And then a second, apologize, a slightly long question. CapEx spending in the quarter and the full year were both strong. We could argue the possibilities here, it\u2019s driven by all the capacity of the demand or you having to spend a lot of it on replacing equipment as they\u2019re ageing out. How should we think about the mix in CapEx between building demand and replacing with there?\nAmy Hood: Let me take both of those. On the first one, in terms of the GM this quarter, you're right. The improvements particularly in the IaaS and PaaS, gross margin of Azure did offset the cloud mix to Azure within the segment, going forward continuing to see that. I think looking more pressured on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate is growing, we\u2019re still not at that point where a $1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to a $1 on-prem. That being said, we\u2019ve a lot as you saw this quarter room to grow gross margin dollars, in that even within that frame going into FY\u201919. On your second question in terms of capital spent, if you think about it at a high level, our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rate than our overall cloud revenue is growing, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see leverage, right, flow through the P&L. And I think that the rate of CapEx growth, as I said in FY\u201919 will moderate, that happens because of course we\u2019re doing some replacement overall. We're adding regions and seeing a lot of global demand, and so -- and improving margin, so I think that\u2019s clearly the very high level as you asked the question. I tend to think revenue is growing faster than the capital. You\u2019re seeing leverage through the P&L and we\u2019ll see a moderating rate in FY\u201919 even if Q1 is the big quarter. It\u2019s just going to be volatile as CapEx tends to be quarter-to-quarter based on both supply chain and demand.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.\nWalter Pritchard: Amy, wondering on the Office side, product and services on the commercial side, you had I think 8% growth. The lowest you\u2019ve seen, I know 606 drive some volatility in that business. Could you help us understand, what drove that in the quarter? And I know you\u2019re making some changes like this support and so forth as you get into the out years. Is there any impact that you expect to the gross rate in that businesses as we look forward from those changes?\nAmy Hood: The entire impact in that KPI, I actually feel very good about that number because if you think about the $1 billion plus beat we had for the unearned, it was due to the fact that we had very good mix shift Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter, almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. Now, this all goes to the balance sheet. So, my confidence for FY19 in that number being the double digits we talked about in the full year guide, only gets raised by seeing that execution. So, it is really 606 related, if the way to think about it plus a mix of billings and billing strength. So, I don\u2019t really think of that as being negative, and you saw the exact same behavior and dynamics. So, it's a pretty similar in period in quarter impact.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Winslow: Amy, question for you. You've commented on the positive spread that you're seeing in the Windows OEM business, both overall, but particularly on the commercial side. When you start to think forward in the next, call it, couple of quarters, here obviously, you told us what the positive drivers were. But how do you see this playing out? And can we maintain that positive spread? And if so, why, and if it does maybe narrow sort of how do you think about the narrowing?\nAmy Hood: So, let me frame it first as this thing that I and we're are seeing really customers driven, which is, if you started Windows 10 and the value the customers seek. And what we're seeing is accelerating enterprise deployment of Windows 10. When that happens, it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improved security. So that then in turn results in a better and stronger overall OEM PC commercial market. In addition because of the macroeconomic conditions are actually quite good on this front and with the business optimism creating some wind at our back, I also think people look and say if security and value are important, this is a great time to invest in modern PCs. And particular in market where pro mix has been strong, I continue to expect to see all of those things happen, through the course of next year. Now, what you will see however, if all those things even do remain true which I expect them to, if the economic environment stays the same. H2 where we've had really strong revenue growth and a really strong market will I think moderate growth wise, just because the base it was coming off in '17 was just a lot lower. So, even if I see all the good things and good trends happening that I feel really create a great opportunity for us to sell Microsoft 365, you will see growth rates moderate next year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Lionel Renshaw with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nLionel Renshaw: Amy, can I go back to the server product, you partly answered it with the whenever ask and I believe hybrid cloud will be a factor here, but the growth was the best we've seen for a long time. Can you just talk about the drivers that kind of were at play here?\nAmy Hood: You're right. The first one was the benefit that we saw from hybrid, in particular, with an outsized impact on Windows Server. The second has been a trend we also talked about a little before. We saw a strong double-digit growth in premium. So, it was mix shift as well as I think strikes in the hybrid benefits as a value across the customers, those two would have otherwise I\u2019d actually call out as drivers for the quarter.\nLionel Renshaw: I mean they should be relatively sustainable, if I listen to them to you?\nAmy Hood: I believe the one -- I think really important thing for us is continuing to focus on creating customer value. The concept of adding a lot of value by having and giving comfort to the customers that as they make a commitment to the Microsoft platform that they can move between a commitment to on-prem to the cloud in a high value way, I do believe is a unique thing that we offer at this time.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nQ - : Satya, this is more of a big picture question, but over a longer term period, I am curios how large you think edge computing will become relative to centralized cloud computing?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I think vision that we have always had is that distributed computing in some sense will remain distributed. So, we don\u2019t split this into, there is an edge computing, there is a cloud computing. The need for computing is on the secular basis going to increase. And as you need to reason over larger amounts of data, you need not only storage and compute to be co-located all over as the world get them embedded with computing, that\u2019s what we are building for. So if you think about our real competitive advantage and differentiation is, we have one programming model, one identity model, security, management. So that modern developers as well as IT can use the compute available from Azure Sphere to Azure. And the reality is these modern workloads in fact lose it all. So it's not like I just build and Azure Sphere application. I build and application that\u2019s fundamentally distributed that also happens to ransom and compute on Azure Sphere. That I think the future which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed, even driven server-less even versus this thing about let's just have one-time migration to something new.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Satya, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. I\u2019d like to understand how you view dynamics current positioning compared to the market opportunities? And the context of the question is, dynamics remains a fairly small part of Microsoft revenues as well if you look at the market share of where dynamic serve, it's a fairly small part of the markets served. So, what do you think Microsoft needs to do to have a larger impact against the market opportunities?\nSatya Nadella: Overall, we are very committed and very bullish about the opportunity in dynamics. With Dynamics 365 for example, what you even to see in this last fiscal year which has been the first full fiscal year where we have this modern, modular approach to business application. I think it's very disruptive in the market place because it brings a very different value proposition. It has a price advantage and the value advantage for customers. And in it what is fundamentally fragmented mark, this is not a business application never was and never will be a winner-take-all. I know folks think about it best state, it\u2019s not I mean it\u2019s about one small category in one segment called enterprise. There\u2019s a share -- high share consider it 25%, 35% of what have you. So in some sense, this one has always been about being able to serve customers especially in an increasing digitization work, right, which is the need for more business process automation is increasing. Take an IoT project, translate into a preventive maintenance in Azure and then ends up as fields service and Dynamics, that\u2019s been one pattern and we\u2019ve seen a ton of traction with. So to me us going in fact to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margins and very high price monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final is coming from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: So, Amy, we keep expecting the Office 365 commercial seat growth to decelerate materially at some point, based upon the penetration level. But this quarter that seat growth actually accelerated about a 1 point to 29%. And when we look back on it the trajectory really isn\u2019t too different than where it was even a year ago. So I was just curious, is there some underlying driver there that would keep that deceleration relatively manageable going forward? Or what you continue to see that flowing in a way that overtime would exert a little drag on Azure through this per user Azure services?\nAmy Hood: This is one where overtime there\u2019s certainly is going to be a deceleration. This is a per user business. And 365 has that characteristic and Office has it, EMS has it, and so this quarter actually what we saw, was actually some strength in education was added a good amount seats this quarter as well as good execution across our other segments. And so, we did see a bit of growth that we were excited to see frankly on a segment where we\u2019ve been working hard to make additional progress and add value. The team has actually done nice job in that segment, created some really modern offers, to get back and to enhance market that as well. But over the long term and as we continue to move aggressively, we will continue to seek growth dissipate, but I would also say this is going to take longer than I think many people would have thought, there\u2019re lots of users as we continue to redefine what Office is that you add to the base. Whether that's first client workers, whether that\u2019s an increasing number of small businesses who finally have access and value that we\u2019re creating for them across things from scheduling all the way to being able to work through minor business process adjustments like Satya has talked about. So, really as we continue to redefine what Office means from something that people will always associate with Word, Excel and PowerPoint, to things that mean in mobile or video would stream, or collaboration with teams, I think we have opportunity to continue to add those new users, new types of users that we haven\u2019t had access before and the capability even to users we have.\nMichael Spencer: That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. It was another strong quarter, the result of picking the right secular trends, delivering differentiated innovation and focused execution that results in increased engagement and usage. The intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge era is already upon us. It represents a tremendous opportunity. We took significant steps this quarter to put this at the forefront of everything we do, realigning our entire engineering organization to accelerate innovation and better serve the needs of customers and partners. With that as a backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Creating a modern workplace where people can do their best work requires the right culture and the right technology. Microsoft 365 helps every organization empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork and fuel innovation, all the while ensuring compliance and protecting data from new cyber threats. Microsoft is a clear leader in cloud security. Advanced AI reasons over hundreds of billions of signals each month to identify anomalies, automate detection and help customers respond to cyber threats. Just last week, we announced new value for customers, Microsoft Secure Score, Attack Simulator and Windows Defender ATP automatic detection and remediation capabilities, as well as a new open API for the Intelligent Security Graph. We've also built compliance capability directly into our cloud services. Thousands of organizations are using the recently launched Compliance Manager with new information protection scanner and built-in classification capability to help prepare for GDPR. Our comprehensive approach and proactive protection are one reason Coca-Cola chose Microsoft cloud for their digital transformation. One year in, Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork. More than 200,000 organizations in 181 markets use Teams from Maersk to General Motors. Teams is now enabled for a broad spectrum of calling and meeting room devices. We're also building AI-powered services into Teams. We've integrated Microsoft Stream, our enterprise video service, into Teams for transcription and time coding of recorded meetings. We've added new facial recognition capabilities, which will attribute remarks to specific meeting attendees. And we are adding new Cortana capability to make calls, join a meeting or initiate three-way calling just using your voice. All this innovation is driving customer usage. Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise, with Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices up 79% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial now has more than 135 million monthly active users, and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 30.6 million. Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. From the start, we recognized the opportunity for LinkedIn and Microsoft to combine forces to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and enable professionals to be more productive and successful. A little over one year in, we feel great about the value we are delivering for members, customers and shareholders Our integration model has enabled LinkedIn to accelerate growth, while retaining its member-first ethos. Results are ahead of expectations across all lines of business with revenue growth of 37% year-over-year. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter with sessions growth of more than 30% year-over-year, driven by innovation across the platform. This increased engagement is driving strong demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors again this quarter in Talent Solutions. Shifting to business applications. Dynamics 365 is gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, up 65% this quarter. We unleashed a wave of AI innovation in Dynamics with hundreds of new capabilities to transform sales and automate marketing, with Office 365 embedded inside Dynamics for productivity. Relationship analytics for sales and marketing leverage the Microsoft Graph and data from social networks to improve customer relationships, and predictive lead scoring helps sellers identify and focus on high-quality leads. We're investing in our business applications platform capabilities across Power BI, PowerApps, Flow and a common data model. Now customers can extend Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and quickly build applications using data from across the organization as well as third-party data with minimal custom code. The new power platform enables customers like Inter Cars, a leading European auto parts company, to go from paper to digitized workflows within days versus months. With the rapid growth of Power BI, we are now the leader in business analytics in the cloud. Now I'll turn to infrastructure and AI platforms. Our architectural advantage of a consistent stack from the cloud to the edge is resonating with customers, with Azure revenue growth of 93% this quarter. Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership position in hybrid, developer productivity, trusted security and compliance and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the edge. We have made the right investment decisions and they're having an impact, increasing our overall share in an expanding market. Our recent data center expansion, including the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland, brings our total number of regions to 50, more than any other cloud provider, and the additional availability zones provide the most comprehensive resiliency in the industry. We also continue to see strong customer demand for Azure Stack across industries, and its unlocking new workload scenarios across hybrid and edge. Industrial IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing, fueling cloud and edge innovation, accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply chain performance. Azure IoT and Azure Stack enable customers and partners to build industrial IoT solutions that run at the edge, so operators on the factory floor can manage devices and analyze data in real-time. And HoloLens is quickly becoming an indispensable tool as we take digital twin technology to the next level. We're also innovating in silicon to help customers realize the promise of a connected world of devices and things. Our just announced Azure Sphere is a first of its kind highly secure edge solution that combines chip design and IoT operating system and a cloud service to secure more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each year. And we're already seeing rapid customer adoption of IoT scenarios. Toyota Material Handling in Europe is using Azure as well as HoloLens to create a factory of the future. Using AI, drones learn complex processes to automate the flow of a factory, increasing supply chain and warehouse efficiency. And Microsoft and ABB are partnering to push the boundaries of smart manufacturing for industrial automation. We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data estates. In less than a year, Azure Cosmos DB, the first globally distributed multimodal and multi-model database, exceeded $100 million in annualized revenue. Azure database for MySQL and PostgreSQL makes it even easier to bring open source powered applications to Azure, expanding our opportunity in this space. We are seeing a rapid adoption of Azure Databricks for data preparation, advanced analytics and machine learning scenarios. We continue to innovate to democratize AI. More than 1 million developers have already used Cognitive Services to quickly and easily create AI applications, and we have more services than any other cloud provider. Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300,000 developers, up more than 150% year-over-year. Microsoft Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is, whether it's in the cloud or on the edge. And just last month, we reached human parity in language translation, a new milestone in addition to our previous human parity achievements in object recognition, speech recognition and machine reading comprehension. We're also gaining traction in machine learning tools adoption with tens of thousands of customers using Azure ML. Finally, we are innovating with new GPU and FPGA-based offerings to lead in AI infrastructure for both training and inference. I'm excited to share more about our cloud and AI innovation at our developer conference next month at Build. Now, to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity in gaming from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We had one of the best quarters in gaming with strong revenue performance and record levels of engagement. Software and services revenue grew 24% as we continued to attract, retain and deepen user relationships across Xbox Live, Game Pass and Mixer. Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 59 million, up 13%. Our new first-party game, Sea of Thieves, drove gameplay across Windows 10 and Xbox One in addition to nearly 10 million hours of viewing on services like Mixer in its very first week. Our results speak to the strength of our platform and services for both first-party and third-party experiences. And we'll continue to invest in our platform, enhancing our cloud services with AI capabilities for developers to quickly build and monetize games across PC, console and mobile. In closing, intelligent cloud and intelligent edge represents a tremendous opportunity for our customers. It comes with a responsibility to ensure trust in technology. We are working to instill this trust in three key areas. The first is privacy. We recognize that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we have consistently acted accordingly. Our success is grounded in our customers' success. We have been working towards the May 25th GDPR implementation date since 2016 with hundreds of engineers across the company working on end-to-end privacy architecture, and we'll ensure that all our products and services are GDPR compliant. For customers, we will provide robust tools backed by our contractual commitments to help them comply with GDPR. In fact, for most customers it will be more effective and less costly to host their data in Microsoft's GDPR-compliant cloud than to develop and maintain GDPR compliance tools themselves. Second, cybersecurity. In response to escalating cyber attacks around the world, we are leading a bold initiative to defend and protect our customers. We recently led a coalition of 34 global technology and security companies in signing the Cybersecurity Tech Accord. The accord is an important first step by the industry to help create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone. Finally, we recently established the AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research Committee at Microsoft to ensure we always advance AI in an ethical and responsible way to benefit our customers and the broader society. This includes new investments in technology to detect and address bias in AI systems. Microsoft stands for trust, and this will continue to be a differentiating focus for us moving forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $26.8 billion, up 16% and 13% in constant currency, with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 16% and 13% in constant currency. Operating income increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.95, increasing 36% and 31% in constant currency. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes, benefiting from the positive global corporate IT spend environment. Growth in cloud services increased our commercial annuity mix, up 2 points year-over-year to 89%. Along with healthy renewals, our sales teams and partners drove a higher volume of new business, leading to commercial bookings growth of 26% and 18% in constant currency. Commercial unearned came in slightly above our expectations due to FX, growing 20% and 17% in constant currency. Commercial cloud revenue was $6 billion, increasing 58% and 55% in constant currency, highlighted by healthy growth in the U.S., Western Europe and the UK. We again improved commercial cloud gross margin, now at 57%, up 6 points, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably Azure. We outperformed our expectation on company gross margin, finishing the quarter at 65%. We are up slightly year-over-year with improvement in our Productivity and Business Processes segment from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn, offset by a decline in our intelligent cloud segment, driven by a greater mix of Azure revenue. FX positively impacted revenue growth by 1 point more than expected, 3 points at the company and Productivity and Business Processes level and 2 points on both intelligent cloud and More Personal Computing. FX added 2 points of growth to COGS and operating expenses, 1 point more than expected. Operating expenses grew 10% and 8% in constant currency as we continued to invest in commercial sales capacity, cloud engineering, and LinkedIn. Even with this accelerated pace of spend, we increased operating margin 2 points year-over-year, a direct result of our focused investments to drive top line growth. Now, to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was approximately $9 billion, increasing 17% and 14% in constant currency, with better than expected results from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter, up 14% and 12% in constant currency, including a couple points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 42% and 40% in constant currency, with continued installed base growth and ARPU expansion driven by customer migration to our premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office 365 commercial seats grew 28%, in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the installed base. Office consumer revenue increased 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and a growing overall installed base. Our Dynamics business accelerated this quarter, growing 17% and 14% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 65%, 62% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 33% in constant currency, with more than $1.3 billion in revenue. We continued to see outperformance across all segments, with record levels of engagement. Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with margin improvements in Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn offsetting the increased mix of cloud revenue. Operating expenses grew 14% and 12% in constant currency as we continued to strategically invest in LinkedIn commercial sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 19% in constant currency. The intelligent cloud segment delivered $7.9 billion of revenue, increasing 17% and 15% in constant currency, exceeding expectations due to our on-premises server business. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 17% in constant currency to $6.3 billion, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 93%, 89% in constant currency on a significant revenue base. Our on-premises server business grew 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for hybrid solutions as well as increasing virtualization needs, resulting in the uptake of premium versions. Enterprise Services revenue increased 8% and 5% in constant currency, with growth in premium support services and Microsoft Consulting Services more than offsetting the continued decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 16% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage declined with the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue mostly offset by another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, driven by our continued investment in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%, up 21% in constant currency. Now to the results of More Personal Computing. Revenue from the segment was $9.9 billion, up 13% and 11% in constant currency, with significantly better than expected results in gaming, Windows commercial and Surface. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 11%, in line with a strong commercial PC market. We continued to see healthy enterprise demand for Windows 10, benefiting our OEM partners. OEM non-Pro revenue declined this quarter by 8%, below the consumer PC market, driven by a higher mix of lower-priced licenses and continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services increased 21% and 17% in constant currency from strong double digit billings as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements. The fundamentals of this business remained healthy, with installed base growth and adoption of our security solutions. As a reminder, under Accounting Standard 606, the Windows commercial growth rate will have significant variability quarter-to-quarter due to its relatively high mix of on-premises licensing revenue. Search revenue ex TAC grew 16% and 14% in constant currency with higher revenue per search and search volume driven by Bing performance in the U.S. and international markets. Surface revenue grew 32% and 27% in constant currency with better than expected performance from Surface Book as we continued to transition to the latest products in our portfolio and against a prior year comparable impacted by product end-of-lifecycle dynamics. Gaming revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency due to Xbox software and services revenue growth of 24% and 21% in constant currency. Momentum in digital distribution as well as record levels of engagement driven by a third-party title contributed to better than expected software and services revenue. We grew Xbox Live monthly active users by 13% to 59 million with user expansion across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 11% in constant currency, in line with revenue growth. Segment gross margin percentage was relatively flat year-on-year. Operating expenses increased 5% and 3% in constant currency from investments in engineering across gaming, search and AI. Operating income grew 24% and 20% in constant currency. Now back to the total company results. In line with our expectations, we increased capital expenditures on a sequential basis with $3.5 billion invested to support current and future growth of our cloud offerings. Cash paid for plant, property and equipment was $2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was up 14%, driven by collections from strong billings growth. Free cash flow of $9.2 billion grew at a slower rate, 3%, due to an increasing cash used for property, plant and equipment. Other income and expenses was approximately $350 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially offset by interest expense. Our effective tax rate came in at 14% due to a benefit from an R&D tax credit. We returned $6.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, increasing total shareholder return by 37%. We nearly doubled our year-over-year amount buyback, accelerating our pace from the prior quarter and now have roughly $30 billion remaining of our current $40 billion share repurchase authorization. Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 3 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point. Second, we again expect strong performance from our commercial business, with solid execution in our largest quarter of the year. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be up 38% to 39% sequentially. Third on CapEx. We expect sequential growth in capital expenditures on an accrual dollar basis, as we continue to see strong demand signals globally. Finally, we expect commercial cloud gross margin to be roughly flat to Q3, representing another quarter of material year-over-year improvement even with increasing Azure revenue mix. Now to the segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.55 billion and $9.75 billion. We expect Office commercial growth rates to normalize as we do not expect the same level of in-quarter recognition on multiyear contracts as we saw in Q3. Dynamics should see another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, driven by Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn growth should remain high. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.95 billion and $9.15 billion, with another quarter of server products and cloud services revenue growth in the high teens as our hybrid cloud leadership continues to be a differentiator for customers. We expect the total Azure revenue growth to reflect the balance of our continued strength in infrastructure, data and application services and a moderating growth in our per user base services like EMS. In More Personal Computing, we expect $10.3 billion to $10.6 billion. Across both OEM Pro and non-Pro, we anticipate trends in Q3 to continue into Q4. In our devices business, we expect Surface revenue growth in the high teens, as we continue to transition to the latest products in our portfolio. Search ex TAC should see another mid-teens revenue growth quarter as it has the entire year. In gaming, we expect a higher revenue growth rate than Q3, as we continue to benefit from third-party game title performance and user engagement on our platform. We expect COGS between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, including 1 point of growth from FX. We expect operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion, with 1 point of growth from FX. This would place us slightly above the high end of our prior range for the full year operating expense growth due to the impact from FX and incremental revenue-driven expenses that support our continued strong top line growth. In Q4, we expect other income and expense to be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains on our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income as we have in prior quarters. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 16%, with some volatility in the final quarter of our fiscal year. Finally, I want to offer a few early thoughts on FY 2019. Assuming the macro environment remains consistent, many of the key drivers of our business should remain intact. Revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services. And within our commercial business, strong execution and our differentiated hybrid position should drive continued high teens growth in our server product and cloud services revenue KPI. Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn should also continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. The gross margin percentage of every commercial cloud service will continue to improve, with more improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and less improvement in our per user SaaS services. While we expect continued improvement in the overall commercial cloud gross margin, the revenue mix shift to Azure will moderate the rate of improvement relative to FY 2018. We will continue to grow our investment and capital expenditures to meet the growing demand for our cloud services. With the business results we've delivered and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead, we will continue to see growth in operating expenses in key areas we've discussed, including LinkedIn. We expect other income and expenses to be slightly negative in FY 2019 as we don't expect to have any significant equity gains. And lastly, we continue to expect the full year FY 2019 effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, with variability across the quarters due to the mix of cloud versus license revenue and the timing of equity vests. And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we be will conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, Satya and Amy. You guys are seeing a really nice acceleration in intelligent cloud gross profit growth. And with 15 straight quarters now of triple-digit premium services growth in Azure, I know you mentioned some comments directionally about the gross margin ramp. But how do we think about the pace of the ramp in gross margin expansion from here for this, for Azure in particular, as you approach what we estimate to be roughly an $8 billion business in annualized revenue? And I guess the other thing that would be helpful is when you think of the COGS of commercial cloud, can you give us a rough ballpark of what percentage of COGS comes from CapEx depreciation? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: So maybe I'll start and then I'll have you, Amy, go into sort of the numbers. One of the things, Heather, that's happening is there is growth in Azure across each of the layers. And I think I've said this before. Sometimes, when you have new workloads and new customers onboard, they start with in some sense the IaaS and the data more at Blob storage, but then scale to higher layer services like our Cosmos DB or even some of our compute higher-level services like in AI. So that I think will continue, because we're still in the early innings of the cloud transition. We're investing aggressively, whether it's on the field side or on the CapEx side to attract more customers and more workloads per customer. So they will have that same profile, which is lower-margin services first, higher-margin services over time. That's just inside of Azure. And of course, you combine that with the rest. One of the things that I think should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data in particular with Azure. So that's why we think of this as one cloud play but that should give you a feel for how the customers are looking at it.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think to your specific questions, there were a couple in there, Heather. If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation, it's best to think of it as roughly half. And actually it's been going up as we began to get scale through these services over time actually. Some of the fixed costs, frankly, even in COGS, tend to come down as a percentage over time. So that should help you roughly to think about how much depreciation is at that number. Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis, and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY 2019 as well. I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment. We'll have significant gross margin dollar growth in that segment, and you'll actually continue to see operating margin dollar growth that's significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal. If you think about gross margins in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth. So even with significant improvement again in, what Satya was talking about, some of the lower level IaaS and PaaS services within Azure, on the gross margin side you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Heather. We'll take next question now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. CapEx increased significantly this quarter, $2.9 billion you said in cash on property and equipment. We know that you build out \u2013 you significantly invest in the data center footprint ahead of demand, but you don't build out the equipment itself that far in advance. Is there a large corporate or government requirement or is it the acceleration in the new data centers that ended up causing that lift? Or is there something else driving it? And as a follow-up, how should we think about that for the next couple quarters? Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Mark. I actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected. A year ago, Q3 was actually a little low. So on the year-over-year basis, I think it pops a little bit, Mark, when on really a sequential basis I actually don't think, to me, it looks out of sorts, especially with the type of demand we're seeing, not just for Azure, but across all of the cloud components. Those growth rates really at 58% on that total cloud number, it's pretty good demand signal on a global basis. So I hear you on a year-over-year basis, but Q3 was a little funny a year ago on that front.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: And we continue to really monitor the actual equipment in that supply chain and what have you. And if anything, there's a lot of automation and demand sensing capability we have there.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. And I would say, Mark, while I appreciate your point that it takes \u2013 and we do build data centers in advance, the majority of the cost obviously in a data center is in the equipment inside. And so, while this really is \u2013 the majority of this spend is servers.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Mark. Operator, can we please move to next question?\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and really nice quarter across the board. There's really not much to pick on in this quarter. One of the highlights from my perspective was definitely LinkedIn and what seems to be an acceleration in the revenue growth in LinkedIn. So a two-parter here. One, where are we in terms of that acquisition? Is this still just LinkedIn operating better as an independent company or are we starting to see some of the synergies, specifically revenue synergies, come to bear from maybe broader distribution channel that they get from Microsoft or product integration? So have synergies started to kick in, number one? And number two, given where we are in terms of the M&A process on LinkedIn, what's the appetite for further like large M&A for Microsoft on a going-forward basis?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Keith, for the question. Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. First of all, it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable LinkedIn to keep their product and cultural ethos of putting members first and innovating on their behalf. I mean, that was sort of our priority one, two and three. And that's what you see in their sessions growth, engagement growth, their quality member growth. And obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions, and sales solutions. We also, during that one year, done integrations. You see it. I see it every day in my Outlook Mobile. I see it in Sales Navigator and Dynamics. And so, you will see us \u2013 with Windows 10, so you'll see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics users, as well as LinkedIn members. And clearly that's increasing engagement as well and that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned. So, yes, revenue synergies are showing up, but mostly because product synergies are showing up, and that's because of the product ethos of LinkedIn around member-first is what we have maintained throughout this integration.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I would also add, Keith, the LinkedIn team has really done a tremendous job. So let me also say, after a year of working with them closely, my appreciation and, frankly, a lot of inspiration that I think you've seen in our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it. In some of the products, I would urge people to look at the Outlook Mobile experience and how really meaningful the experience is for the user and the member. And I think sometimes it's harder for us to measure exactly what a revenue synergy means. But I think I look at this and say, at a 37% growth rate, plus some of the integrations we've seen and the growth in uses and users of things like Outlook Mobile, I believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see in product over time. When it comes to our appetite for M&A, actually it has remained unchanged, which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us, where markets are expanding, where the companies have a unique asset, I think that our ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside Microsoft, I actually feel quite good that we don't worry about our ability to do them, but I wouldn't say that's new this quarter.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. And I think just to add on that, which is whether it's Minecraft or LinkedIn or many other acquisitions we've done as part of Azure, I think the key thing that we are very, very focused on is how do we make this culturally accretive, management times accretive as well as revenue. And that's where we are building good muscle and we'll continue on that.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much guys.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question now please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And just to start, Satya and team congrats on getting Microsoft to over 10% organic growth. That's a big achievement for a company at your scale, and it looks like you're expecting the same for the June quarter, so congrats. So I guess, my question is in the spirit of this, to Amy, on the overall growth margin trade-off as you look into fiscal 2019. Amy, when I go back to the Analyst Day you had almost a year ago, I left thinking that your messaging was really that you were going to press on revenue growth and not on big margin leverage. So I'm just wondering as we look into fiscal 2019, is it correct to assume that that's a similar framework with the focus on top line growth and not to expect much in the way of overall improvement in gross margins? Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Karl. Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency. I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us. You see it this quarter. You see it frankly in the guide. And I think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company, even at our scale, is certainly the right interpretation.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Karl. Let's please move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, Thank you. I'm wondering, maybe a combination of Amy and Satya, talk about the forward kind of view of Azure growth and how we should think about the drivers of that as we go into 2019. New customers existing consumption, premium services and I think we're growing at eye-popping rates right now. We saw that with Office 365 in the early days. How should we expect this business to sort of level out over time as I think it inevitably will as we look to next year?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah and I'll start qualitatively. And it's true that we are at this point at scale on Azure and with very, very high growth rates. But as I said, I think the key things that we think about is differentiation of Azure at each level because that's what is super important for us as we compete in this marketplace and more importantly double down on areas of differentiation we have. So the first thing is on the infrastructure side itself with the combination of the edge and the cloud I believe between Azure Stack and Azure as well as inclusive of our servers, we have the best crowd platform for what is going to be hybrid computing and we'll continue to push on that, so you'll see growth. It's just got a different margin profile. The layer above that is the place which we are very excited about. We've seen lots of consecutive quarters of growth in our higher-level services but we're now seeing some good scale. I, for the first time, talked about Cosmos DB. This was actually a database we just launched last year. I mean, I've been around databases for a long time. I've never seen a product that's gotten to this kind of scale this quickly. And so we're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we'll continue to build on that piece. But as I said, one of the key things is, architecturally, the way we build Azure, the way we build Office 365, the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture. And you see that even in the way customers use it. So overall to your specific question on Azure, the growth will moderate as the numbers become big, and they've already become very big. But that said, we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participate, in which we by the way, never participated in the old server world.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And, Walter, I think the way you see that show up is really in my conversation on FY 2019, to Satya's point, really we talked about that server product and KPI being high teens through FY 2019. We're really confident in double-digit growth in that PBP segment with the components of Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn. So if you think about that as the primary components of our commercial cloud overall, we're certainly saying that it's a big business growing very fast at $6 billion not counting LinkedIn. At 58% growth, it certainly speaks to having a big base and a big growth number. On Azure, you're right. It will moderate through next year. But because of the scale at which it's operating, that's why you still see that server KPI remain at that high level even as the base grows. And so you will see also some different dynamics within that Azure revenue number. Satya mentioned the layers of Azure. If you think about the IaaS and PaaS numbers, I would expect to be on the higher end of growth rates. And some of the services that are more per-user like, like EMS within the Azure frame, you would expect that growth to moderate somewhat more quickly just because it's a per-seat business. You will actually over time see us be able to continue to add ARPU and growth in those segments. Think of it almost like an Office business. Internally, we call that component part of our Microsoft 365 Value. That's how we sell it externally even. And so hopefully, that helps give a little context to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high teens.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks Walter. We'll take the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey guys, thank you guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Satya, you touched on the synergies that you're seeing between new applications businesses and LinkedIn helping the two out. Wonder if you could talk just sort of high level and strategically about applications and enterprise applications in Azure, and how you kind of see the synergy potentially coming out between those, especially when you think about Azure AI and all the services, or kind of the question is, how important or how critical are applications like the growth that we're seeing in Dynamics, et cetera?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yes, I mean, one of the things that I talked about in my remarks this time was this power platform. One of the areas of in fact real breakout growth in differentiation as being in Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. For the first time in fact, in our own Microsoft history, we have an extensibility model that is the same for Office 365 and Dynamics 365. This has been a dream of mine for, I don't know, for 15 years probably. And we are finally here and we are executing super well. But the interesting thing is it's not just even for our own SaaS applications. It is the extensibility model for every SaaS application out there, including a common data model. So I think that that's where the synergies lie, because AI starts with having a data estate that can really bring data from all of your applications, silos in some sense, together so that you can start doing, building that analytical power that you can then visualize and put in the hands of people using Power BI or run an AI model that does some prediction that you can deploy in your system, whether it's forecasting, sales lead scoring, what have you. So that workflow, we have every layer of it. We have the best deployment tools and development tools in Azure. We have this common data model. On top of this, we have the best BI visualization technology. So that's what you're seeing increasingly as the synergy. But most importantly, architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these layers is where you may feel like you're making some great best-of-breed sort of choices in individual layers, but you'll bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of your data. And that's where I think we will be very differentiated.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great, thanks guys.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks. Let's move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Okay, we'll move on to the next question which is coming from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks very much. Maybe Amy, quick question. The Windows OEM Pro business has been extraordinarily strong the last few quarters. Could you maybe give us a sense of how penetrated you guys are in the Windows 10 corporate upgrade cycle and the sustainability of that growth? Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks Brad. Let me, first, I wouldn't say penetration is the word for this. Let me talk about this in two or even a couple of components, because when you think about Windows 10, what we've seen over the past couple of years is, you're right, a very strong enterprise deployment cycle and real pull for that product inside enterprises, because of the security value prop of the product itself. When you see that deployment for security reasons, an externality of that is people often choose to upgrade machines in that process. We've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices, in that choice, I think it's benefited our OEM partners and us. The portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling. I think our partners have done a terrific job on that as well. The overall economy is certainly also quite good, and the installed base had actually gotten older. And so I think what you're starting to see is a process whereby there's a great product, there's a good macro environment. And you've got customers who really want to move to a modern infrastructure. A modern infrastructure has to both be secure at its very core, and that can result, as you're seeing through that confluence of events, in a very strong PC market with very strong Pro performance. And certainly, the guide for Q4 continues to imply all those factors.\nBrad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Brad. We'll take next question now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Satya or Amy, can you help us understand the large revenue outperformance and guide for continued strong growth in gaming? And Amy, could you please give us a sense of the margin profile of the areas of gaming that exceeded expectations? And if you could also comment on the strength of the MPC margin in the context of the gaming margin as well, that would be helpful. Thank you very much.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah, I can start and then, yeah.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Why don't you start.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Because even on gaming, very much like how we talk about some of our commercial segments, we've gotten a strategy which sort of really helps us articulate both the growth opportunity as well as our investments across all of the various layers. So first is, the console itself is the highest engagement console out in the marketplace. So anytime a new game, whether it's first-party or third-party releases, the fact that Xbox is where the best engagement is driven benefits us. So as a platform owner, that's a great growth area for us. But we don't stop there because now we have, whether it's Xbox Live, whether it's Game Pass or Mixer, these are all additional opportunities to really serve the gamer as they play more games or watch games on different platforms. So that's the other big opportunity. But the last one, which I think is new and is something which is already paying its dividends on the Azure growth side, is we've taken all the knowledge of what it means to build any one of these first-party titles of ours and building it as a PaaS service in Azure for game developers, and the PlayFab acquisition speaks directly to that. So those are all the various levers we have in gaming. And you'll see it in the MPC segment and you'll see it, as I said, increasingly over time even on Azure.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think, Michael, if you don't mind, I'm going to expand your question a little bit, because I don't think the increase in the MPC guide is simply gaming. So let me talk a bit about the components and which ones, I think, are a bit more sustainable and which ones may have a temporal nature to them. The performance in Q3 and the guidance for Q4 shows actually strong performance in a number of places that we expect to continue. OEM Pro is a terrific example, for the reasons I just gave in Brad's question. Windows commercial, which is really the business inside the enterprise of selling much of the security value on a far more annuity-like basis, we've seen strong double-digit billings growth there and we expect that to continue into Q4 as well. The next piece that I would say is a part of that sort of uplift in Q4 is our Surface device. The reception to Surface Book 2 as well as Surface Pro with LTE has been quite good. And you see us reflect that again in Q4 even as the comparable gets a little bit more difficult than it was in Q3 for us when you saw a very large growth rate. We're still expecting high teens there. Then you get to that gaming component, and specifically what Satya was talking about, the Xbox software and services component is where I would expect to see the impact of the continuation of Q3. Part of that, I want to be very clear, is consistent even going back a few quarters. That has been a double-digit grower. It will be a double-digit grower. There'll be some volatility in the number like anything else. And third-party hit games will move it higher as they did this quarter, and we're expecting in Q4. But there's also a really strong base to that business that is the result of what Satya's talking about in terms of having a vibrant platform with fans that believe in it and come to it with all the value that's been added.\nMichael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: So did that help? Okay, great. Thanks.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Michael. We'll move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks so much. Hopefully, the line is clear this time. So Satya and Amy, I wanted to ask about server products which was striking growth this quarter, given the comp. And, Amy, you talked about expected strength into fiscal Q4 and all of that, I guess, is testament to the strength of the kind of hybrid leadership you have. But the two questions though were really, is that strength in server products broad-based across Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, et cetera? Or is there any sort of bias in the mix, if you will, in terms of what's driving that strength? And then, Satya, you mentioned Cosmos DB and that was a striking number to me as well. And I was just curious, do you think now you have the multi-model database in market that can help you take market share within the data management database space? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I'll take the second one. I think that, yes, I mean, Cosmos DB's pretty unique capability in combination with everything else we do in both the data layer, the AI layer and the infrastructure layer, I think we have a tremendous opportunity, because, as I said, this AI era is mostly first a data era. And that's where I think the opportunity lies. But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends here, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products. The other growth driver of server products is cybersecurity and the security value in our servers. So that's one. The fact that we now have SQL and, for example, when you think about SQL itself, it's a hybrid product. You can tier SQL databases with the cloud. SQL is an AI product because we have the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database. So, for example, when we talk about data and AI close to data, because computation will always go wherever data is. And a lot of data shows up in relational databases and we have a growth driver there as well. And then there is the hybrid choices, where if somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, what is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory. And that's where Azure Stack shows up. So multiple drivers of what is essentially the server and cloud number in combination.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And to your point on the component, the on-prem component, even with comparable doing well, let me break Satya's comment into sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining. And it's across both Windows in particular, but also SQL, which are obviously the largest products within our server portfolio. The first exactly with hybrid demand. We have something called Azure Hybrid Benefits. What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their timelines and their confidence. And so, with that right, it lets them easily transition between Windows or SQL to those same benefits in Azure with a small uplift in price. I think that has actually been a core component. The second one was the virtualization drive or data center modernization, another one, do move the premium mix up a bit. So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thanks. And this will be our last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Last question will be the longest one; really, really long. Thank you guys for getting me in. A question for you, Satya. As you meet with CEOs of large companies, this is a recurring theme that we've been hearing from other software company CEOs, the theme of digitization. Can you help us to understand, especially given that Microsoft's growth rate is accelerating whereas the GDP growth rate is the GDP growth rate. So obviously, tech spending or IT spending as a percentage of GDP or average company revenue is going higher. So can you help us, given your perspective, which is pretty unique, help us understand what is the baseline of IT that we've been operating in, when it comes to digital business transformation, what are the phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 initiatives like and where are companies likely to spend more? And what kinds of products and services that are new and upcoming or maybe you sell them today that comprise that incremental swing factor over the baseline of what IT is today versus wherever we're likely to go with the digitization of business processes? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah, I mean, I think when we talk to customers and CDOs, CEOs, what have you, we talk about four digital transformational outcomes. In fact, everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients to helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on, for example, how do they engage their customers. When I talked about Cosmos DB growth, Cosmos DB happens to be one of the best database products to be able to capture the signals that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources. That's gone one example of it. The second piece is of course around empowering your employees. I mean, one of the things that now has increasingly become a number one priority for every CEO is to make sure that the right tools, the right products are in front of their own employees so that they can do their very best work and collaborate. So teams grow. There's a great example of how companies are modernizing their workforce with things like Microsoft 365. The third one is operational efficiency. When you see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project, so that's a classic way somebody says, let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service. So that's a transformational outcome where we're very well positioned. And lastly, people are changing their business models. You take somebody like a Nalco Water. You could say they're a water company, but now they're pure water service company. In other words, they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model to their customers. And so that's the transformational outcomes we see. And we feel, at Microsoft, we're well positioned both with the technology but also with our frontline sales capability, service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs.\nKash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Wonderful. It seems like CRM, HCM, ERP, IoT, these are the predominant themes that are going to be driving your growth. Thank you very much. Very useful, insightful.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Kash. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. You can find additional details at the Microsoft Investor Relations website.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, everyone.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 2, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-01-31 23:59:03", "content": "Executives: Chris Suh - General Manager of Investor Relations Satya Nadella - Chief Executive Officer Amy Hood - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Ria. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, our new Deputy General Counsel, Corporate Secretary. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide to the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This quarter, we incurred tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have excluded the impact of this tax charge in our non-GAAP net income and earnings per share metrics. These non-GAAP financial metrics should not be considered as the substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses is performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 31, 2019. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during the conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Our results this quarter speak to us picking the right secular trends and markets, and following that up with focused innovation and execution. The intelligent cloud and intelligent edge paradigm is fast becoming a reality. Azure growth accelerated. LinkedIn growth accelerated. Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 are driving our growth and transforming the workplace. Xbox is reaching new customers with new offers. With that as the backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Every CEO I talk to is keen to start their transformation journey by empowering their employees in creating a modern workplace. They want productivity and collaboration tools that deliver continuous innovation and do so securely. Spectre and Meltdown are the latest instances in an increasingly complex threat environment. Our investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats. Protecting customers will continue to be a top priority. Our continued commitment to operational security and advanced technology is one reason customers like BP, Goodyear, PayPal are choosing Microsoft 365. MasterCard chose Microsoft 365 to empower employees and inspire teamwork with integrated apps like Teams, Yammer and SharePoint. We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365 with the simple goal of helping people do their best work. Insights in Excel is a new service that uses machine learning to detect and highlight patterns. Translator brings 60 languages to Word. We're helping people be more productive on the go on any platform with real-time co-authoring in Office apps on iOS, Android and now the Mac. And just this month, we announced that dictation will be available across multiple apps in Office 365, empowering users to write freely using only their voice. We're making voice a first-class input for productivity. Cortana can help manage your e-mail, by pulling up important e-mails, reading them aloud, and letting you reply using just your voice. We're also bringing Cortana's intelligence to Outlook Mobile app, notifying you when it's time to leave a meeting to get to your next one, based on your location and traffic. Mixed Reality empowers employees with new immersive experiences. Enterprise customers like Mercedes Benz in Germany are using Mixed Reality to transform training, helping maintenance technicians learn everything from guided brake repair to how components in a new diesel engine work. We're expanding our opportunity with Microsoft 365 for organizations of all types and sizes. Take Firstline Workers, leading global telecommunications, retail and hospitality companies such as BT, Target, Panera Bread and Delta Global Services, all chose Office 365 to maximize the impact of their Firstline Workforce. In education, we're empowering every student with new learning tools natively built into Office 365 to improve reading, writing and comprehension, as well as Mixed Reality experiences for immersive learning. This quarter, we launched Surface LTE and unveiled a new generation of always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs from our OEM partners. With up to 20 days of standby power, this new category of PCs, deeply integrated with Cortana and with new near-field and far-field capability, will fundamentally change productivity. Now, I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. As we pass the one-year mark of Microsoft and LinkedIn, uniting the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network, LinkedIn continues its strong trajectory with accelerating revenue growth and record levels of engagement. The fifth consecutive quarter of more than 20% sessions growth. Appetite for conversations across the platform continues to grow from sharing in the feed, to video, to one-on-one messages sent, all up more than 60% year-over-year. This increased engagement across the platform is driving strong growth in demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors in Talent Solutions. LinkedIn is continually creating new ways for members to connect and engage with one another, such as this quarter's launch of Career Advice. From the deeper integration of Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics for Talent to the launch of Profile Card to bring personalized LinkedIn insights directly into Office 365 to the new Resume Assistant. I'm excited about the many ways in which we are delivering powerful customer and member experiences that leverage both the Microsoft and LinkedIn Graphs. We continue to see good momentum in Dynamics 365 with revenue growth of 67% year-over-year. Our modern and modular business process applications are resonating with customers driving digital transformation. Park Place Technologies, a global leader in datacenter support, chose Dynamics 365 along with LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration. And United Technologies and Columbia Sportswear chose Dynamics 365 and Azure for their digital transformation. Now I'll talk about Cloud and AI. As Intelligent Cloud, Intelligent Edge becomes more predominant, our architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. You see this reflected in the latest CIO surveys, as well as in our 98% Azure revenue growth this quarter. Only Microsoft delivers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. This architectural advantage helps us address both existing enterprise workloads and new workloads such as IoT and Edge AI. To thrive in this new era, customers need a consistent stack across public cloud and the edge, a model Azure Stack uniquely enables. Since broad availability just a few months ago, we are seeing incredible customer demand for Azure Stack across a diverse set of industries, including Schlumberger, ABB and Mitsui Knowledge Industry. We are democratizing data science and AI, so any organization can convert their data into actionable insights and drive competitive advantage. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed, multi-model database. It is unique in its support for a new class of low-latency, event-based server-less applications. Azure Databricks brings leading Apache Spark-based analytics. Our new SQL Server on Linux is off to a strong start with more than 5 million downloads and will bring more developers to the SQL ecosystem longer term. To thrive in a world with millions of intelligent end points, every company needs an IoT strategy. Microsoft is giving customers comprehensive solutions to help them realize the promise of connected world of devices and things. Azure IoT Central is the first global-scale SaaS offering that enables customers to build intelligent, secure, enterprise-grade IoT app in hours. Azure Event Grid simplifies the creation of event-driven IoT solutions across millions of end points. Azure IoT Edge enables customers to run server-less computing and machine learning models at the edge. Chevron is using Azure IoT to harness massive amounts of data from its oil fields to accelerate deployment of new, intelligent solutions for oil exploration and to manage thousands of oil wells worldwide, increasing revenue and improving safety and reliability of their operations. Kohler is building connected, voice-activated products powered by Azure IoT and Johnson Controls is using large-scale device management capabilities in Azure IoT and Windows IoT for their new smart GLAS thermostat with Cortana voice control. We reached the human parity milestone in machine reading comprehension using the Stanford Question Answer Dataset benchmark, which is the ability for AI to read a document and answer questions about it. We're using this and other AI advances to address some of society's most pressing challenges by partnering broadly across industries. In healthcare, we are partnering with Adaptive Biotechnologies to build a practical solution for mapping the human immune system to detect cancer and other diseases in the earliest stages. We've created a HIPAA-compliant Health Bot powered by Azure Cognitive Services to assist with questions about health insurance, symptoms, and location of nearby doctors. Aurora Healthcare, UPMC and Premera Blue Cross have already signed on. In retail, Kroger is using Azure to power their digital grocery store display solution for real-time pricing and promotions based on customer data to boost sales. Lowe's autonomous in-store robot uses Azure to keep constant tabs on inventory and identify out of stock or misplaced items, freeing store employees to focus on their customers. And Publicis Groupe's new AI platform built on Azure and Office 365 will empower their 80,000 employees worldwide. Now, let me turn to Gaming. Our new Xbox One X was the top selling premium console this holiday in the United States, and we saw strong sales of the Xbox One S. We will continue to innovate in console to attract high value gamers, who want immersive 4K experiences, to build a broader subscription service with Game Pass, and to extend our services to all devices in our customers' lives across console, PC and mobile. Our decision to release exclusive game content on the Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with global release increases the value of the subscription for members and our partners, and we are off to a very good start. We grew gamer engagement again this quarter with 59 million monthly active Xbox Live members, record usage of our Xbox Live services, record viewers of our new streaming service, Mixer, and record Minecraft users. Finally, we just acquired PlayFab, which serves more than 700 million gamers with more than 1,200 games from companies like Disney, Rovio and Atari. It's a complete backend platform for mobile, PC and console game developers to build, launch, and scale cloud-connected games, extending our investments in Azure to provide a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry. Before I turn over to Amy, I want to reflect on a topic that is at the forefront of every customer conversation that I have. In an era, where there is rapid transformation driven by digital technology, customers are looking for a trusted partner. Someone with a business model that is aligned with their long-term interests, deep technical innovation, and an understanding of the responsibility that goes along with this innovation. This perhaps is one our key differentiators. Internally, we have a saying, Microsoft runs on trust. And we strive to earn it every day with all of the constituents we serve. Now, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for the questions later.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $28.9 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency, with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 12%. Operating income increased 10%. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge of $13.8 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding that, earnings per share was $0.96, increasing 20%. We achieved another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth, as we continued to realize the impact of strategic growth investments, along with strong sales execution. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth and 5 points of gross margin growth, with minimal impact on operating income growth. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed a $111 million to operating income and continues to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectations. Across most geographies, our results were in line with overall, improving macroeconomic trends. Large markets including the U.S., Western Europe and France performed better than expected, driven by commercial cloud momentum. Our sales teams and channel partners delivered another quarter of outstanding commercial results even as we continue to work through our sales reorganization from July. Our commercial revenue annuity mix improved by 3 points year-over-year to 86% with healthy renewal rates. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, even with a 20% smaller underlying expiration base. Commercial unearned revenue came in slightly higher than expected, at more than $20.2 billion, from growth in multiyear customer commitments to Azure. Commercial cloud revenue was $5.3 billion, growing 56% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across geographic markets and customer segments. Gross margin increased by 7 points to 55%, in line with seasonal trends. We improved gross margin percentage in each cloud service, and Azure again saw the most significant margin improvement this quarter. Company gross margin was 62% and flat year-over-year. Sales mix of higher margin products and services, including better than expected performance from Windows Server and Windows OEM Pro, combined with improving cloud margins offset the impact of the growing mix of cloud revenue, LinkedIn amortization cost, and device launches. The FX impact on company and segment revenue growth was in line with expectations. The weaker U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by less than 1 point. FX had only 1 point of impact on operating expense growth, less than expected. This quarter, operating expenses grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, with 10 points of growth from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. We continued to increase investments in cloud engineering, AI and sales capacity to drive future growth. Now to the segment results. Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 25% and 24% in constant currency to $9 billion, slightly better than expected, fueled by LinkedIn revenue acceleration. LinkedIn contributed 15 points of growth. Office Commercial revenue grew double-digits again this quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 41% from installed base growth across all customer segments, and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value offers in the E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 30% in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the base. Office Consumer revenue increased 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by Office 365 recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 29.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 67% and 68% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was better than expected, at $1.3 billion, driven by strong sales execution across all LinkedIn services. We saw continued strength in user engagement, customer acquisition, renewals, and upsell performance. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 23% in constant currency, with 14 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including the impact of $222 million of amortization expense. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the impact of LinkedIn related amortization expense and the increased mix of cloud services. Operating expenses grew 41%, 39% in constant currency, with 33 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses increased on cloud engineering and sales capacity investments. Operating income increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, with only 2 points of negative impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.8 billion of revenue, growing 15%, with better than expected performance driven by hybrid cloud. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 18% with another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 98%, with Azure premium services revenue growing triple-digits for the 14th consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5%, and 3% in constant currency, as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 13%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly, as the impact of increasing cloud revenue mix was mostly offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses grew 3% and 2% in constant currency from ongoing investments in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%. In More Personal Computing, revenue was $12.2 billion, up 2%, with better than expected results driven by Windows and Search. Excluding phone, revenue grew 4%. Our Windows OEM business grew 4% this quarter, better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue reflects a stronger than anticipated commercial PC market bolstered by improved macro conditions and continued healthy enterprise Windows 10 deployments. We benefitted as well from a higher mix of premium licenses and the timing of license purchases. OEM Non-Pro revenue was down 5 points, below the stabilizing consumer PC market. We continued to see growth in the premium category in line with the market, but heightened price competition on entry-level devices contributed to lower volumes. Inventory levels remained in the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services declined 4% and 5% in constant currency, mainly due to the impact of a large deal in the prior year. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 15% from higher revenue per search driven by continued optimization of our advertising platform, and search volume growth in both the U.S. and international markets. Surface revenue grew 1%, roughly flat in constant currency, as we continued to transition our portfolio towards Surface Laptop, Pro with LTE and the new Surface Book 2. This holiday quarter, Gaming revenue grew 8%, mainly driven by hardware revenue growth of 14%, 13% in constant currency, from the launch of our premium console, the Xbox One X. Xbox software and services revenue growth was 4%, with continued monetization growth partially offset by prior year first party AAA title launches. Segment gross margin dollars were roughly flat year-over-year, with the decline in Gaming offset by growth in Search and Surface. Segment gross margin percentage declined, as expected with the console launch. Operating expenses increased 2%, and 1% in constant currency, from growth in engineering investments in Search, AI and Gaming that were partially offset by declines in Windows marketing and phone expenses. Operating income declined 2%. As a reminder, Q2 was the last quarter of phone comparability given the sale of the feature phone business last year. Now back to the overall company results. As expected, our capital expenditures, including finance leases, increased sequentially to $3.3 billion due to higher levels of customer demand and usage for our cloud services. Cash paid for property and equipment was $2.6 billion. Free cash flow generation - free cash flow grew this quarter 23% driven by operating cash flow growth of 25%. Free cash flow increased from higher customer collections following strong billings growth, working capital improvements in the hardware business and contribution from LinkedIn. Other income and expenses was $490 million this quarter, more than planned, due to higher interest income. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 18%, lower than anticipated, driven by an audit settlement as well as the normal variability between service and license revenue mix, geographic revenue mix, and the timing of equity vests. We returned $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. Assuming rates - assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point. With positive IT spend signals, a strengthening commercial PC market and growing customer demand for hybrid cloud services, we expect our commercial business to remain strong, as we drive annuity growth, expand our installed base and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. And our Q3 expiry base will return to year-over-year growth, impacting commercial bookings growth. Third, CapEx. We will increase our capital expenditures to support increasing demand and capacity requirements. On an accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter. We expect year-over-year improvement in overall commercial cloud gross margin as Azure margin improvement continues to offset an increasing mix of Azure revenue. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. Both Office commercial and consumer revenue growth will be driven by Office 365, with growth rates for each consistent with Q2. We expect double-digit Dynamics revenue growth from the shift to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn should deliver approximately $1.2 billion, growing more than 20%. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.55 billion and $7.75 billion, with strong double-digit revenue growth in server products and cloud services. In Enterprise Services, we expect a revenue growth rate similar to Q2, as growth in Premier support should offset the decline in Windows 2003 custom support agreements. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion. In Windows, we expect OEM revenue to be largely in line with the total PC market. Both OEM Pro revenue and Non-Pro revenue should be impacted by similar dynamics seen in Q2. Now to Devices, Surface revenue should grow year-over-year from continued launch momentum from the latest Surface Pro, Book and Laptop, but decline sequentially consistent with holiday seasonality. In Search ex-TAC, we expect a similar strong rate of revenue growth to Q2. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter, but with a revenue-mix shift to software and services and continued year-over-year growth of our Xbox Live user-base. We expect COGS between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. Given the opportunity ahead of us and our execution to date, we will continue to invest in intelligent cloud, intelligent edge, AI and our sales teams to drive sustainable top-line growth. Other income and expense should be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains in our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income. This is lower than we previously expected, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio. Now, a few comments on the fiscal year. First, given our outperformance in the first half of the year, we are now ahead of our previous expectation for full-year gross margin. We are now trending to be roughly flat year-over-year including LinkedIn. Second, we still expect full year operating expenses, including LinkedIn, between $36.4 billion and $36.7 billion. We are confident in this investment, given our significant growth opportunities, consistent execution and strong competitive position. Third, on operating margin we are again trending ahead of our previous guidance. We now expect company operating margin, including LinkedIn, to be slightly up year-over-year. Excluding LinkedIn, company operating margin should improve by more than a point. Fourth, tax rate. Based on our current understanding of the recently enacted tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for H2 to be 16%, plus or minus 2 points. For FY 2019, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, due to the impact of tax law provisions effective for us July 1, 2018. We will continue to have quarterly variability based on the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vest. Finally, we remain consistent in our ongoing commitment to capital return. As always, we believe the highest shareholder value is created first through organic and inorganic investment to pursue the significant market opportunities ahead and are proud of our resource allocation changes and the results. And, we've been focused on capital return through both dividends and share repurchase as a key part of our commitment to total shareholder return for many years. With the recent tax reform, we can continue that commitment without the need to access the capital markets. Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Chris Suh is moving to a new role as the senior finance leader of our Azure and Server business. On behalf of the company, thank you for your significant impact on Investor Relations for the past five years. And I'd like to welcome Mike Spencer, the former finance leader of our Office 365 business, as the new Head of Investor Relations. We look forward to having you lead the team. Now, Chris, let's go to Q&A.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A. Ria, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks very much and congratulations on the results. So relative to your guidance, over half the beat this quarter came in the Intelligent Cloud segment. So I wouldn't mind digging in there a little bit. And it wasn't just the amazing Azure performance. Your on-prem server product business accelerated despite the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call. Even Enterprise Services was plus-3% instead of flat. And your guide actually suggests that that goodness in Intelligent Cloud should continue next quarter, despite actually a way tougher comp. So I'm just curious, Amy or Satya, if there are any threads that you can weave through this Intelligent Cloud outperformance, if you saw any broader increase in enterprise spend in the December quarter. Any change in behavior or is all of this goodness a little bit more Microsoft-specific? Amy, you called out IT spending signal, so I'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Karl. Let me start and, Amy, you can add. I mean, for me it all comes down to really having an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend. So when we think about the Intelligent Cloud and the Intelligent Edge, and then bring that to the Azure business, you can see it at each layer. When it comes to infrastructure, we're the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with Azure and Azure Stack. When it comes to the data tier, we have real uniqueness. Take something like Cosmos DB. It's the only planet-scale database, that's multi-model, supports these new programming models of server-less and event-driven programming. Take SQL, what we are seeing in terms of SQL growth, in terms of Azure DB, as well as SQL server and SQL server on Linux, that's again addressing the customer needs. There are new workloads that are being born, that require both the cloud and the edge, IoT being a great example of that. And especially when you take that in combination with AI, again, you train on the cloud and you score on the edge. That's a real competitive advantage. We have everything from sort of the lifecycle management of how these models get created and deployed, and so on. So I think that's what you're seeing. There will be variability quarter to quarter. There will be mix differences. But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going.\nAmy Hood: And I would say, Karl, a couple of things. We've been investing here both in engineering to land the differentiation that Satya just talked about in sales resources and then continuing to invest in technical sales resources that can help our customers be successful in these deployments. I actually think you're continuing to see the impact of those investments growing in time and growing in expertise. And so, I feel encouraged both by the technical differentiation, but also the return on the investments we've made here, that lead us to have good amount of confidence that you do see in the guide in Q3. And yes, you're right, we do have a tougher comparable, particularly on-prem in Q3, which is correct.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, thank you both.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Karl.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Karl. We'll move to next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Eric Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Very - again, a really solid quarter. And, Chris, it's been great working with you. Sorry to see you go from this role. I'll ask my questions. One question for Satya, and starting a little bit narrow, maybe running off from there. Gaming in the quarter seems to have - had a good quarter for gaming with Xbox launch. But more broadly, there are some murmurings out there about Xbox falling behind PlayStation. If you look at the sort of the bases of those two consoles, there are murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console. I know you sort of mixed up leadership a little bit there. How do you feel about your positioning in gaming from a narrow focus? And then more broadly, how are you guys feeling about your position in the home if you will. When I go home, I'm talking to Alexa. I'm not talking to Cortana. Is that something that you're comfortable with where we are today? Is that something we should see improving on a going forward basis?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Keith. So let me take both of those questions. So on gaming, we feel good about Xbox One X, the premium console launch. We also feel good about the volume we got for Xbox One S, because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console, because that creates the sockets for gaming for us. But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. PC gaming is a growth market. And so, therefore you see us, whether it's our subscription offer, whether it's our streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus PC together. And then, not stopping there, but going to other devices, for example mobile. Minecraft on mobile we just launched in fact in the last quarter in China. We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China. So overall, you will see us do good work on the console, we'll compete there. But more importantly, we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services streaming services across all devices. And one other point I think I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure. In other words, we have now increasing past services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers. Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox, but it's going to help developers across the board. So that I think will also transcend or lead into even media companies. So we're very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming. So that's our focus on gaming. In terms of Cortana and home, I think it's probably important. Although the question I'll ask is, you asked it narrowly, but my investments are much broader. In other words, I first start by saying let's make sure our best AI capability, whether it's speech, whether it's ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management, because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding. So all of those investments, for example, are available on Azure as Cognitive Services. I even referenced in my remarks how in healthcare people are using those to build bots and skills and agents. That's where we will make sure we do our best, building blocks and AI work. Of course, it will manifest for us with Cortana as an agent from Microsoft that has some special skills, especially around that crossover between work and life. Most agents and their knowledge or smarts come from the data access they have. In our case, it's going to be about things that are there in Office 365. The people, places, things and how we reason about it and help users, whether they're at home or whether they're at work. Lastly, even when it's comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants. That's why we are working with Alexa, we would welcome it on our devices, because we believe in a world where our own assistant should be available everywhere and so should other assistants be available on our devices versus thinking that the end game here is about speaking, doing one-turn dialogues on one speaker in one home. That's just not our vision.\nKeith Eric Weiss: Excellent.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Keith. We'll move to next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with [Ever AB] [ph]. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. Congrats first on the great quarter, and Chris, thanks and congratulations on the new position, so you'll be greatly successful. Satya, I'd like to ask you a question, can you give us a sense of what is the adoption of Azure in the U.S. versus International, not just in the revenue point of view. But in terms of the mix of premium workloads, types of workloads, et cetera? How should we think, where we are in that process?\nSatya Nadella: I would say, the U.S. has been a lead market in general when it comes to the latest technology and architectural paradigm adoption, whether it'd like take something like AI or the higher-level services around data. We clearly see first things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the UK. There are certain workloads like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with the industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan. But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. And they have differences in industry patterns, because different industries are strong in different parts of the globe. So - and then, they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Mark. We'll take next question please, Ria.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, Amy, I guess you've been talking about and so is IR about the commercial bookings, where the expiry base was down over year-over-year - on a year-over-year basis. I am just wondering, if you look ahead to 2019, is there anything you could share with us about the size of the expiry base in that period just so we can think about it? I know, you don't give guidance that far out, but just as we start to think about - thinking about further out growth. And then, I guess the other question would be - you mentioned better IT spending. But just also given the significant savings companies in the U.S. are going to be seeing due to lower tax bills. Is there any early feedback from partners or customers about the rate that this might be reinvested back into IT spending and digitization? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Heather. In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute, it's higher than it was a year-ago Q2. The reason we called it out, obviously, because it was such an outlier. And if you look back three years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to three years ago. So I feel great about our sales execution especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts. To the question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular - I think, it is quite early, but as we said the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2, as we noted. And I think, we are optimistic as we look to H2, when we see the signals we're seeing in the market whether it's PCs, server or the cloud demand.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Heather. Thanks. We'll take next question, Ria.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats not only just on the income statement, but also obviously the balance sheet where, obviously, the commercial, it was only down 5% versus your guided 7%, so congrats there. The - my focus is actually on the commercial side, but specifically on Office. Obviously, your Office 365 revenue continues to outpace seat growth there. We've talked about that in the past with pricing, but if I just look at also overall Office on the commercial side, up 10%, same as Q1, when you all think about just going forward just the mix of those two, obviously, the on-prem business is still declining in the high-teens, and then Office 365 growing rapidly. How do you think about just the blended growth of Office commercial and the puts and takes there?\nAmy Hood: This is one, where I tend to when I think about that 10% number, it really is the same way I think about Office 365. Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward, is our ability to continue to grow the installed base, and to also continue to grow our ARPU. The combination of those two things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales re-org that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication, and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers. And you've even started to see it this quarter as you're pointing out, Phil. We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we have been seeing. It's been in the market a while, we're seeing that momentum, the value all up of E5 not just from an Office perspective, but from a Microsoft 365 perspective with security and management as well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like Teams. I think we feel really good about where we are, and the value and our opportunity both from small business up to the large enterprise from first line workers to do all of these - do all these things and continue to execute well. So the guide certainly implies that continued optimism.\nPhilip Winslow: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Phil. We'll take - go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thanks for taking my question, and all the best for you, Chris. I just wanted to double click on the productivity gaze you see in the Cloud especially on Azure. Can you talk a little bit about the [drivers there] [ph]? I know one is that your build-out pattern was different than some of your competitors, so you're kind of filling capacity. But also talk a little bit about what you see in terms of how you are delivering the services in Azure and how that's evolving? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: I mean, overall we did take an approach that we want to make sure we meet the real world needs across the globe. And we'll continue to do so, when we look at our CapEx spend we want to make sure that the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally across both consumer workloads and enterprise workloads, where real data sovereignty requirements and speed-of-light issues are already relevant. Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do. So that's why the mix of these higher level services especially around data and AI is definitely driving a lot more consumption of our higher level services. And even something like IoT, they're not just at the consumption meters, but they're also got SaaS like qualities to them. So I feel very, very good about ultimately having innovation that drives both the consumption of more higher level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world, where the demand is going to spread to, because we are in the very, very early innings of essentially this new cloud growth, and there's only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitization of every city, every factory, every hospital and so on. So I think we have a long way to go to still fill up.\nAmy Hood: And I would say, the way to think about that and you see it in the gross margin percentages and the improvements we've continued to see is the Azure premium revenue growth exceeding the overall revenue growth that actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. Then again all the work we have done through the supply chain. So while we have a signal come in, you see a very quick turn from demand signal to us having servers in place and ready to be utilized very quickly. That work continues and the team has done a really nice job. And then as well software improvements, they continue to go on to increase our ability to run more or less. Those taken together continue to show gross margin improvement.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Reimo. We will go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much. Amy, I'd like to follow-up on Heather's question, because it's really difficult to grow commercial bookings by mid-single-digits constant currency in the face of 20% or so declining EA expirations. And so I'm wondering, looking beyond this quarter, if you could expand on how commercial bookings growth ex-renewals is trending? And in other words, are you getting more separation, if you will between reported growth and growth excluding renewal activity?\nAmy Hood: Let me take a shot. The way I think about bookings growth every quarter, as you tend to look at a couple of things. And I would say, I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract? Do we expand our footprint, our percentage of the IT budget at a customer? Do they rely on us for more products and more services? This quarter is a good example of that happening. And if you think about the connection to why that happens it's not just a terrific engineering work that we've done in product value, it's also the investments that we've made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way. So that I think feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective. And so, then the next component obviously is being able to grow just brand new accounts. Are we growing customer bases? Are we penetrating segments and you also saw that in the quarter. So at a high-level you can either sort of add more, expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and I feel good about our execution. I think there is and you'll see that dynamic, so if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the booking side and when the expiry rates' growth - it's really about the delta between the two as you know. And our execution this quarter was quite good. But it's come from sustainable investment and our sales, technical resources, and in the engineering to deliver a differentiated value at the customer.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful, thank you.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Gregg. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Hi, Satya, my nine-year-old kid insists that the Minecraft is the best thing for his brain development. So whatever it is congratulations. But serious question is with cash repatriation obviously Microsoft has the ability to bring back a lot of money. I'm wondering what the priorities of the company are with respect to doing a large strategic deal or not so perhaps, and perhaps even share repurchases and dividends. Clearly, this is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and there is a lot that can be done. Curious, how you think about this. Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: I'll actually let Amy.\nAmy Hood: Yeah, why don't I take this. Number one I would say, we have - when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that. Our opportunity, the TAM, really the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition and digital transformation that's occurring now. And so, we've invested to make that happen. We made acquisitions when they made sense. We have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business. And so for us, we also didn't wait when we thought about capital return. Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase. And we've been on that path for a number of years. Now, that being said, I am pleased obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not has to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices. Whether it's investment in ourselves, and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. And I think today, we would even say it's a more strategic asset than we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph and our understanding. And then, be able to return capital. So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us we have felt a necessity to do that for years, as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. And I think we've done a good job. And I'm proud of what we've done, and I'm proud and excited for what we can continue to do.\nKash Rangan: Terrific. Thanks so much.\nChris Suh: Thank you, Kash. We'll take one - the next question, please. We'll move to the next question please, Ria.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nMichael Nemeroff: Well, thanks for taking my question. This one's for Amy, about the Office 365 commercial. Are there any limitations other than storage-related workloads that would limit Office 365 commercial gross margin from reaching, say, 80% over time? And what are some of the current limitations on that gross margin that you'd think could be improved upon, for that to work higher than 70% over time? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks. You're right. In general, workloads like Exchange and increasingly SharePoint, which we have seen some really great encouraging numbers on usage of SharePoint in our Office 365 commercial base. Those do have storage requirements. And so, you're absolutely right. They are slightly different than many of the very high-level SaaS workloads that you see. But we still do have room, which I think is really the core of the question. We still have some room to improve that Office 365 commercial gross margin, from the new workloads we've added, which have even more of this pure SaaS like workloads, and aside from Office, in that same segment is Dynamics who - or LinkedIn, which both have those SaaS like margins, and can, and we see opportunity to both improve those as well. So I don't think there's necessarily a level, but there's certainly room even within these storage-heavy workloads.\nSatya Nadella: I mean, I'd just add, this is not specifically to the gross margin question, but the expansive nature Microsoft 365, first of all, we think of it all up in that context. Amy already referenced how small businesses that perhaps never did advanced workloads are now able to do so. Emerging markets that never did are able to do so. So first of all, whether it's - on firstline workers, we never had any solutions for firstline workers. So there is a market expansion in terms of users and the sophistication of the workloads that they can use or the higher-level services. The other thing is Office by itself. You talked about storage. It's an interesting question to say, what is being stored in Office, in meetings going forward, at home office or people calling in, things like mixed-reality being used in meetings. It's very different. It's not about you sitting in front of Word and entering text. That's not the full limit of Office. Office is about any people collaborating in voice or in - with even computer vision and many other ways that I think collaboration will happen. So we have a very expansive view, much like Azure for infrastructure, and data and AI. In terms of human activity that gets digitized at work and at home is something that we're going after with Microsoft 365.\nMichael Nemeroff: Thanks for taking my questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Michael. We'll go down to our last question now please, Ria, if we can move to it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Satya, I wanted to ask you about Azure Stack adoption. You mentioned it was ahead of your expectations on the call. And, I guess, if you think about your early traction with service providers and how you're empowering them to build these Azure capable datacenters globally, maybe longer term how should we think about the impact of this on Azure hyper-growth durability beyond fiscal 2018 as you scale?\nSatya Nadella: See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed. Let's just take for example what's happening in a factory. In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors. Lot of the sensors today are in fact rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud. As you do more of that, what happens is you need to - and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action. The speed of light gets in the way. So they want local compute. And so, in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors, you may in fact need Azure Stack. So it's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it. When I think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing, where there is a cloud, there is an edge. And even the edge is not just one single edge. But it's got a topology associated with it, going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory. So that's where we're going to end up, which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed. How - and quarter to quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case. But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go.\nChris Suh: Okay. Thank you, Alex. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the coming months at various investor conferences and events. You can find the details on the Microsoft IR website. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all. Thank you very much.\nAmy Hood: Thank you all. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Microsoft Corporation Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Jesse. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting our results under the new revenue standard, ASC 606. As we detailed during a conference call we hosted on August 3, the adoption of the standard had several impacts, but most materially, the revenue recognition of Windows 10 OEM licenses and the license component of on-premises annuity contracts. As we discuss our Q1 results and share our outlook on the call, please keep in mind the following: first, the new standard allows us to simplify the communication of our results by eliminating the non-GAAP revenue reporting; second, there's no change in customer billings, cash flows or revenue recognition for our cloud services, hardware, enterprise services and advertising businesses; and lastly, the quarterly seasonality of our revenue within a given year does change, and we may experience higher quarterly volatility as well. The prior periods we will reference on this call and in the earnings materials on our IR website have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. During our August 3 call, we also translated our outlook for Q1 into the new standard, and all references to expectations on this call refer to that translated guidance. You can find additional information on this accounting change located on the IR website. All growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 26, 2018. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We are off to a very strong start in FY 2018, delivering double digit top and bottom line growth and exceeding $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago. I'm proud of our team's work behind these results that spanned all of our segments. We now have 120 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial. We have more than 530 million LinkedIn members. Dynamics 365 customers grew 40% year over year. Azure Compute usage more than doubled this quarter and revenue grew 90%, and Windows 10 Commercial monthly active devices grew 90% year over year. These results reflect our accelerating innovation as well as increased usage and engagement across all businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform. Amy will cover our financial results in more detail, but today I wanted to talk about the key areas of innovation and opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. Our focus is on bringing our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value for customers by galvanizing around five key solution areas. First, top of mind for every CEO is empowering their own employees for the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is our core offering to address this $500 billion-plus market. We are bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security as a complete integrated solution for organizations of all sizes. It represents a profound shift in the way we design, build and deliver our productivity solutions, moving to a people-centered approach, spanning all their devices to unlock creativity and inspire teamwork while simplifying security and management. This past quarter, we launched a wave of innovation across Microsoft 365. The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update empowers people with new AI-first interfaces, ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling and Mixed Reality experiences. Cloud sharing and co-authoring experiences are now natively enabled with OneDrive files on demand. We are making Windows 10 more accessible to everyone with new features like the eye control, which gives people the ability to operate a PC using just their eyes. You'll see a great lineup of Windows 10 devices this holiday from the new Surface Book 2 to a vibrant range of devices from our OEM partners. This month, we also introduced Windows Mixed Reality broadly. Mixed Reality, which is a voice, gaze and gesture interface, will fundamentally change the way people and teams collaborate. Our work with Ford is a great example of this promise. Ford's designers are using Mixed Reality to blend 3D holograms digitally with models and physical production vehicles, allowing them to experiment and iterate on design much more quickly. HoloLens, Windows VR headsets and Microsoft 365 enable any customer to blend physical and digital worlds across devices, empowering people to collaborate in the same shared experience from anywhere in the world. AI is infused across Microsoft 365 in a myriad of helpful ways, making it easier for people to create high-impact presentations and documents, automate routine tasks and search and discover people and content in highly personalized and relevant ways. Beyond new AI capabilities in PowerPoint, Word, OneNote, SharePoint, we're enabling AI-first workloads like Bing and Cortana using the Microsoft Graph. Soon, you'll be able to search not only the public Internet but also corporate intranet sites, line of business applications and people with Bing for Business, now in private preview. With Cortana, you'll be able to query your calendar and automate tasks like scheduling a meeting or replying to an e-mail using just your voice. Microsoft Teams is core to our vision for the modern workplace as a digital hub for teamwork, bringing together conversations, meetings and content into a single canvas. We are integrating AI and cognitive services to make meetings more productive for users today and longer-term. Lastly, Microsoft 365 connects users, devices and SaaS applications into a single control plane to simplify IT management while providing comprehensive security across the entire digital estate. Today's sophisticated threats require AI-based security approaches. Using the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, we process billions of signals to detect and remediate threats. New conditional access capabilities evaluate risk in real-time based on the user's account, device and application and physical location. Our leading-edge security and management capabilities are just one reason customers trust Microsoft 365 for their modern workplace needs. Now, I'll turn to LinkedIn and our business applications. From the outset, the priority one was to ensure that LinkedIn, on its own, accelerate its mission and growth while retaining its culture as part of Microsoft. Nearly one year in, we are ahead of plan with LinkedIn contributing positively to EPS ex-purchase accounting in fiscal 2018. Second, we're seeing record levels of engagement. LinkedIn is on target to surpass 21 billion sessions this calendar year and has seen its fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus sessions growth. Engagement across the platform is strong, with 65% year-over-year growth in jobs, visitors across mobile and desktop, 60% growth in feed update views and nearly 40% growth in messages sent, driven by more ubiquitous messaging. Third, innovation and execution are accelerating in both the business and in the product integrations across Microsoft, with a positive reception to native video, career advice marketplace and this week's launch of smart reply messaging. LinkedIn profile integration in Office 365 delivers rich people insights from both the LinkedIn Graph and the Microsoft Graph. The Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics to transform business-to-business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution to compete in the talent marketplace. You'll see more product integration in fiscal 2018 as we continue to accelerate our innovation to connect the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network. Now, I'll turn to two areas of our hybrid cloud value proposition, applications and infrastructure and data and AI. We've been focused on addressing the real-world needs of customers with our differentiated approach to the cloud, architecting for hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance. Moreover, customers are choosing the Microsoft Cloud for its operational consistency, productivity and security that spans the entire digital estate, inclusive of Windows 10 security and management, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security and Azure. Let's double-click on hybrid. To support the emerging intelligent cloud, intelligent edge application pattern, you need a consistent stack across the public cloud and the edge. Merely providing colocation services or connectivity between on-premise data centers and the public cloud is not sufficient to meet customer needs. You need consistency across the development environment, operating models and technology stacks. Azure provides this consistency across the entire stack, inclusive of identity, data, app platform, security and management at the edge and in the cloud. Our hybrid cloud is one of the reasons nearly every Fortune 500 company has chosen to partner with Microsoft. Costco recently chose Azure as its hybrid cloud platform, and we are excited to partner with them on their digital transformation. Core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. Azure SQL DB makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premise data center to a fully-managed instance in the cloud with no code changes. SQL 2017 is now broadly available on Windows, Linux, Docker containers, with everything built in, including the ability to run AI compute close to the data with Python or R. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database that enables developers to write apps for IoT and other event-based serverless applications. We're accelerating our innovation to help every developer be an AI developer with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple ML models to powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. We continue to enhance our cognitive services to give every enterprise powerful building blocks to create their own AI applications. Finally, we continue to invest in making Azure the most trusted cloud with AI-based security built in. Azure confidential computing enables encryption of in-use data to ensure that information is always under customer control, a first for any public cloud. Our ongoing data center expansion brings Azure to 42 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider and 69 compliance offerings and the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. And new Azure availability zones provide new levels of resiliency for high-availability apps within a region and across regions. Now, let me turn to our last solution area, Gaming. We are mobilizing to pursue our expansive opportunity in the $100 billion-plus gaming industry, broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We will continue to connect our Gaming assets across PC, console and mobile and work to grow and engage the more than 53 million Xbox Live member network more deeply and frequently with new services like Game Pass and Mixer. And we are a few days away from launching the Xbox One X, the most technically advanced and powerful console ever built. Moreover, we have high expectations for our Gaming business to bring more people to more Microsoft experiences and broaden our engagement and usage scenarios. This means fundamentally rethinking how we measure progress in Gaming. While we continue to innovate across the console, PC and Xbox Live services, we see substantial additional opportunities across e-sports and streaming. At 20% this quarter, our software and services revenue growth reflects the early-stage potential of this larger opportunity. We also see the opportunity to empower developers who work on console, PC and mobile games to use our cloud infrastructure and services to enhance their game play and community. Gaming pushes the boundaries of hardware and software innovation, with some of the most CPU and GPU-intensive applications and content, giving us a huge opportunity in the cloud. As one example, PUBG Corp., with the hit game PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, is not only partnering to make Xbox the exclusive console at launch but is also running on Azure. In closing, across the company, we are mobilizing to pursue our five core customer solution areas. We are partnering deeply with our customers so that our new technologies and innovations can help them digitally transform, grow and thrive. Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $24.5 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 15%. Operating income increased 15% and earnings per share was $0.84, increasing 17%. Our strong start to the fiscal year with double digit top and bottom line growth is a result of our consistent execution and ongoing investment in product innovation and sales capacity. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth and had a 4 point drag on operating income. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed $78 million to operating income. We are confidently ahead of our original financial commitment for LinkedIn. We now expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year. Our results were in line with macroeconomic trends, with better than expected performance from large markets like France, Japan and the UK and stabilization in markets like Brazil and Russia. Our sales team and partners delivered strong commercial results this quarter. Multiyear commitments from customers contributed to an 89% annuity mix. On a roughly flat dollar volume of EA expirations, we grew commercial bookings 14% and 9% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue came in higher than we expected at $21.5 billion, primarily from higher Software Assurance billings and FX benefit. Our commercial cloud business had another quarter of robust revenue growth and material gross margin improvement. Revenue exceeded $5 billion this quarter, growing 56% year over year and gross margin increased 8 points to 57%, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably in Azure. Our company gross margin was 66%, up 2 points from prior year as sales mix of higher-margin products and services, along with improving cloud margins, more than offset the impact of the growing cloud mix of revenue and LinkedIn amortization cost. The FX impact of a weaker than expected U.S. dollar increased total company revenue growth by 1 point. At the segment level, FX had minimal impact on Productivity and Business Processes and increased revenue growth in both Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing by 1 point. FX added 1 point of growth to operating expenses this quarter, which grew 16% and 15% in constant currency. LinkedIn contributed 14 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangible expense. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 28%, also 28% in constant currency, to $8.2 billion with better than expected results due to FX as well as Office commercial, consumer and LinkedIn. LinkedIn contributed 18 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 10% as revenue mix continued to shift to Office 365 Commercial. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 42% from strong installed base growth and ARPU expansion. Companies like Lowe's and Devon Energy chose Office 365 to connect their employees and empower them in the modern workplace. And with our channel partners, we added on average more than 50,000 small and medium business customers each month, a trend we have sustained for more than 3 years. Office 365 Commercial seat growth was up 1 point sequentially to 32% and declined 8 points year over year. We do expect that year over year trend to continue, given the increasing size of the base. Office consumer revenue increased 12% or 10% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 28 million. Our Dynamics business grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by the revenue mix shift to Dynamics 365. Customers like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Seattle Seahawks have adopted Dynamics 365 to modernize their business processes. Dynamics 365 grew 69%, same in constant currency, with continued installed base and ARPU growth. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than we expected. Post-acquisition sales execution has been strong with record levels of user engagement. This quarter, LinkedIn sessions again grew more than 20%. Segment gross margin dollars grew 25% and 24% in constant currency with 15 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined due to the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization. Operating expenses grew 54% and 53% in constant currency with 49 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with 10 points of negative impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion in revenue, growing 14% and 13% in constant currency with better than expected performance driven by hybrid cloud results as well as FX. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 17%, also 17% in constant currency, with another quarter of double digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue grew 90% and 89% in constant currency and Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 13th consecutive quarter. Our unique ability to provide a distributed hybrid model for the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge continues to attract customers to Microsoft. Symantec, the industry's largest security vendor, has adopted a company-wide hybrid strategy with Azure, including delivery of its Norton consumer products to a global community of more than 50 million people. And financial services firms like Bank of America, TD Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are all using Azure and its data services to improve customer experiences. Enterprise Services revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as premium support services growth offset declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 10%, the same in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to the increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. This quarter, operating expenses grew 3%, or 2% in constant currency, from ongoing investments in sales capacity and engineering. Operating income increased 20%, the same in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $9.4 billion with FX as well as each core business contributing to the segment's better than expected results. Excluding phone, revenue grew 3%, the same in constant currency. Both the commercial and the consumer PC markets were better than we expected, contributing to OEM revenue growth of 4%. OEM Pro revenue grew 7%, ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium SKUs and a couple points from timing of license purchases. We continued to see Windows 10 deployment cycles drive commercial customer hardware demand. OEM non-Pro revenue was down 1%, in line with the consumer PC market and reflecting healthier conditions in key markets like Brazil and Russia. Inventory levels were in the normal range for a pre-holiday quarter. Windows commercial products and services grew 7% and 6% in constant currency, mainly driven by seat growth. We continue to see enterprise customer momentum, with Coca-Cola Company, Her Majesty Revenue & Customs and Rogers Communications choosing Windows 10 for its intelligent security features and advanced management capabilities. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily due to a one-time impact of IP deals signed in the prior year. Search revenue ex TAC grew 15%, the same in constant currency, from higher revenue per search and stronger than expected performance from volume. Our online businesses showed healthy improvement in revenue growth and profitability as we realized the benefits of scale. Our Surface business grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by sales of the new Surface Laptop in both the commercial and consumer segments. We continued to see solid execution through the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our new devices. Gaming revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as Xbox software and services growth offset declines in hardware. Software and services revenue grew 21%, or 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in monetization. Our engaged user base grew 13% to 53 million monthly active users across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms. Additionally, new services like Game Pass and Mixer, which create more opportunity for engagement and monetization, showed encouraging early results. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10%. Gross margin percentage increased primarily due to sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 1%, or 2% in constant currency, from lower Windows and Gaming marketing spend and our last full quarter of significant benefit from phone savings. Operating income grew 26%, the same in constant currency. Now back to our overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, including finance leases, down sequentially and lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter to quarter volatility. Cash paid for property and equipment was approximately $2.1 billion. Our significant capital investment continues, mainly based on customer demand and usage signal, and the teams remain focused on gross margin improvement as they deploy services globally to meet that demand signal. Free cash flow grew 10% from operating cash flow growth of 8%. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had $1.3 billion in unsettled cash equivalent positions that reversed the following quarter. Excluding this amount, free cash flow increased 27% from higher customer collections following strong billings growth and working capital improvements in the hardware business, primarily driven by our exit from the phone business. Other income and expense was $276 million, a little more than planned, as we continued to see opportunities in the equity market to realize gains throughout the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 18%, 1 point lower than we expected, primarily due to geographic mix of revenue. This quarter, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchasers. Now, let's turn to the Q2 outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 1 point, COGS growth by 1 point and OpEx growth by 2 points. Our commercial business should remain healthy, with solid renewal execution and increasing customer demand for our hybrid cloud services and new cloud solutions like Microsoft 365. Turning to commercial bookings. As you know, the underlying dollar volume of EA expirations impacts commercial bookings growth. For the full year, total expirations will be up slightly, but Q2 expiration dollar volume will be down roughly 20%, impacting our Q2 commercial bookings growth. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 7% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality. We remain committed to material improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage. Margin performance is variable quarter to quarter, driven by revenue mix and seasonality, as well as the timing of infrastructure spend. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement and sequential trends consistent with prior years. Next to CapEx. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. And on accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.75 billion and $8.95 billion. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the transactional decline. We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business, given the prior-year comparable. In Dynamics, we expect continued double-digit revenue growth, driven by the shift to Dynamics 365. And we expect approximately $1.2 billion of LinkedIn revenue, reflecting continued strong sales execution by the team. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.55 billion, with another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. As a reminder, starting in Q2 of last year, the launch of Windows Server 2016 drove strong on-premises performance, resulting in 6% constant currency growth for server products. This comparable will impact the segment's year-over-year growth rate. We expect Enterprise Services revenue growth to be similar to last quarter, driven by Premier Support Services offsetting declines in custom support agreements. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $11.7 billion to $12.1 billion. First on Windows. OEM revenue should track roughly in-line with the overall PC market. Specifically, OEM Pro revenue growth should be more aligned to the commercial PC market, normalizing for a couple points of growth from the timing of licensing purchasing in the first quarter. Next, Devices. In Surface, we expect revenue to be up slightly from Q1 as we continue to transition to the new Surface Pro, ramp Surface Laptop and launch the Surface Book 2. Also in November of last year, we closed the sale of our feature phone business, so this will be the final quarter of revenue comparability impacted by the phone. We expect double-digit revenue growth in search ex-TAC, reflecting continued strong performance in both rate and volume. And finally, Gaming. We expect revenue growth from the launch of the Xbox One console and continued healthy growth of software and services revenue. In Q2, the higher mix of Gaming hardware revenue will significantly impact both the segment and company gross margin percentages. We expect COGS between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, in the normal range for a holiday quarter with new device launches and including 1 point of FX headwind. This includes approximately $400 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization expense. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, which includes 2 points of FX headwind. This includes $1.1 billion of LinkedIn expenses, of which $154 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be approximately $450 million as we continued to take gains in our equities portfolio. And we expect this pace to continue until the end of the fiscal year. Now, let me share some additional comments on fiscal 2018, given our strong first quarter results, our business momentum and the changing currency landscape. First on FX. For the full year at current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue, COGS and OpEx growth at the company level by 1 point. Therefore, we now expect full-year operating expense growth, excluding LinkedIn, to be between 4% and 5%. This is unchanged from our prior outlook except for the updated FX impact. Second, on margins. With our strong Q1 results and the FX impacts I just outlined, we are trending a bit better on both gross and operating margin relative to our original full-year outlook of down roughly 1 point each. We now expect operating margin, ex-LinkedIn, to be up year over year, even as we increase investment to support long-term top-line growth in commercial cloud, AI, Mixed Reality, quantum, new hardware launches and the continued transformation of our sales team. Third, tax rate. We're updating our full-year tax rate to 22%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability due to the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and timing of equity vest, and expect next quarter's tax rates to come in at the midpoint of that full-year range. Chris, let's go to Q&A.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. Satya, a question for you. We've been seeing Intelligent Cloud growing very well for quite some time, Azure sustaining very, very impressive growth rates, but even the server and tools businesses sustaining growth. When we think about the drivers of that growth, is this just continued share gains by Microsoft, enabling you guys to outgrow the market? Or have you started to see stuff like AI and all these additional cognitive services that you bring to the market actually accelerating workload growth within your customers? You're actually like building new market opportunity for yourselves with these additional services.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Keith, for the question. And I would say all of the above. One of the things that we started always, we always believed in distributed computing, and we've built for that so when we say hybrid, we never thought of it as some kind of a temporary state but we always thought the edge and the cloud was going to be where the application pattern was in fact going to get to. In fact, I'm very excited about some of the new workloads. If I look at whether it's IoT or AI, the two workloads that are new, both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation, which event-driven computation. So we feel good about new workload growth. We feel good about this lift-shift modernize motions that are happening. We feel that we're well positioned for both meeting today's realities of our enterprise customers, but most importantly, where on a secular basis I believe hybrid computing is going, which is to this architectural pattern of intelligent cloud, intelligent edge.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Keith.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, we'll take the next question now, Jesse, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I had a question related to Azure. You guys mentioned on the call that premium services grew triple digits for the 13th quarter in a row. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how to think about the percentage of workloads that are now running premium services as a percentage of the total. And/or are we at the point now where that's a high enough percentage of the mix that we're at a tipping point here, where what seems like very significant gross margin progression is going to continue at this similar clip? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I mean, I can start and, Amy, you can add to this. The premium services, for example, the way we think about them is in everything related to our data is, and especially the higher level databases, so I'm not talking about raw storage but this is Cosmos DB or Azure DB or any of data services, our IoT services, our AI services are all the premium services. And there is a path. Every customer sometimes just starts with infrastructure as a service and some storage. And then the lift-shift turns into lift-shift and modernize and that's where these premium services get activated. So they definitely are margin accretive for us, but most importantly, they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers. And I'll let Amy add any additional color to that.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I think, Heather, it gives me a good opportunity to talk a little bit about the real drivers of the Azure gross margin improvement. There are really, when you think about it, three. The first one's just pure revenue scale. We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building, land that at customers. The second component, and the one you'd asked about, is a little bit about that premium services revenue mix. And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin. And addition to the workloads Satya mentioned, I'll also bring up EMF. EMF continues to be I think of incredible value to customers. And I think we've done a very good job of pointing out its competitive advantages, and we're seeing that also benefit margins. And finally, just the strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the prox and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it. Those things together, with premium being a component of that, are all lending itself to gross margin improvement.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Heather. We'll take the next question now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office because you've obviously spent a fair amount of time on Azure, the gross margins there. But within Office, you've got several secular trends as well as just mix shift going on there just from a price point perspective as well as the gross margin between the different levels of E1, E3, E5. So wondering if you could give us some color of what we're seeing there, because obviously, there's healthy, healthy seat growth, revenues outpacing and it seems like margins are as well. So just provide us more color on sort of what we've been seeing and kind of how you think about that trending going forward?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Let me just start at the highest of levels, because for us again, and in this last quarter, some of the innovation that we launched I think is also pretty key as you look forward to what it means for Office and Office growth. One of the new suites we have is called F1 and this is about first-line work. So Office is no longer limited just to the knowledge workers. In fact, we see significant opportunity for some of our teamwork, collaboration, communications, as well as scheduling software to be very, very relevant for anyone who's on the manufacturing plant or a retail specialist. Some of our social tools like Yammer are increasingly getting used for broad communications, inclusive of Skype for Teams. So I just wanted to put that in there as well, as there is of course E3. There is E3 to E5. But there is also F1, which is increasing the overall penetration and not to mention the small business segment, and of course all the markets that we participate in with Office 365 where we don't have much of a server business at all. We sold Office on-premise or Office perpetual clients. But now you can have a small business in a country like India, buy Office 365 as a subscription service. So those are all the things that are in play.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I do think that's important, Keith, in terms of the innovation and the value. I think sometimes, on this call in particular, we talk about there's installed base growth and there's ARPU increases. Sitting underneath that is this very large 120 million dollar-monthly active users in commercial. And they're experiencing frankly the latest innovations that the company has built. So I look and say, seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ARPU, and the new services that Satya mentioned continues to let us grow the installed base. Innovations around teams, innovations in AI in the actual Office products themselves are now being experienced by our customers. I think when you have that happen over time, it builds confidence in the product and it builds confidence in end-user confidence in itself. And then purchasers are happy to continue to add SKUs and add and move up the scale. We still, this is primarily the ARPU growth, continues to be some of the earlier transitions we've always talked about. It's that E3 transition as well as installed base growth. E5 continues to see encouraging signs. We're starting to see it enter but that will take a long time, as we've talked about, to actually land in ARPU.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Phil. We'll move to next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. This one for Amy. Amy, just a general sort of corporate-wide question on gross margins. Your revenue and COGS guide, if I ran the math correctly, imply about 60% gross margins for the December quarter. So that's going to be down year over year and I suspect below some of the street estimates. But it sounds like your tone is a little bit better for gross margins for the full year. So I just want to make sure I leave the call understanding what's happening here. Is the conclusion that 2Q is somewhat of a one-off, given the uptick in lower-margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year over year pattern on gross margins? Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Karl. Actually, this is really all the gaming Xbox One console launch. It's very specific. And so every other gross margin trend across IC, across PBP and across the rest of the MPC portfolio exhibits the exact same fundamental drivers and improvement. And so really, this is really 100% the Xbox One X impact in Q2 of the launch on the company gross margin and in particular, the MPC gross margin.\nKarl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Karl. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. I think another question for Amy here. Just looking at the dependent \u2013 trying to figure out the dependency of your Azure growth this year on the volume of annuity up for renewal. I know last year, you had very, very strong growth in annuity on that renewal cycle, and you're talking about some pressure in the Q2 and then a slightly up trend for the year. But how dependent is Azure growth in customers attaching that to the volume of annuity up?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah, I wouldn't call it pressure, Walter, just how I think about it. There's just an expiration base that comes up every quarter.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And there's volatility to it. So the way to think about it is over the year, it's up a little and in Q2, it happens to be just a low quarter of the 12 that come up through the cycle, much like Q4 was quite large in the cycle. And Azure actually falls a couple of patterns. It's not just about EA attach although it absolutely can be one of the motions. Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity, and the reason we did some of the sales transformation, was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycle, and you've really seen that. The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great, thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Walter. We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks very much and I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Satya, yesterday you were down at the GE event and announcing the partnership with them around Predix. And I was wondering, when we think about the opportunities for Azure to be that sort of trusted platform for ISVs, can you just talk about how you think the progress is going on that front? Because it seems to obviously just expand your overall TAM and the kind of use cases you can address by bringing partners like GE onto your platform. Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Overall, I think you sort of speak to I think one of the big advantages and one of the big value propositions we have on to both sides. One is to the enterprise customer. We are a trusted partner. And we support them with their hybrid computing needs and their AI needs. One of the things that we emphasize is it's not about our technology, but it's our ability to transfer that capability to our customer because they're increasingly becoming, whether you're in retail or you're in oil and gas or you're in financial services, every one of them is trying to build their own software capability and we are uniquely capable of doing so. The second part is the ISVs. We now, in fact, one of the big areas of investment this year was the core sell capacity in our field so that ISVs can be successful on our platform. Whether it is GE or Adobe and many others can all now benefit, both because of our enterprise partnership and credibility, and more importantly because of the field resources we have put in place. So we are really looking forward to accelerating our business with GE and many others to come. But it's a very important core sell motion and more importantly building trust on both sides of that equation.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Kirk.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question, and again congrats on the quarter. I'd like to look at Dynamics 365. It's been growing really fast. It was center stage at Envision in almost every presentation and discussion. Can you talk more about how you think about the opportunity and give us a sense of which of the offerings right now within 365, whether it's CRM or Talent or ERP or whatever, are driving the growth and could be part of the future growth? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mark, for that question. The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SCM. Because we realized that, for example, you take any IoT project that is starting in Azure, it first translates into an analytics workload that pulls through some Azure high router analytics services. And then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance, you need field service. And all they need is just a very robust field service module that's cost-effective and efficient. And so we're able to attach that to that project. Similarly on Talent, they want to be able to \u2013 if you start on LinkedIn with hiring, you want to be able to do the on-boarding and talent management. That's the module you want. Even on the operations side, we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same, there is need, and with increasing digitization, there is more operational modules that you need. So that's what we've designed it for. So the growth is actually across the board. It's coming in customer service. It's coming in sales. It's coming in talent. It's coming in operations, and we have some very competitive price points there. The other one is that there is no such thing as a canonical business. There's no such thing as a canonical business in time. That means things are always changing. So customization, customization and composition, especially with Office 365, is very important, and this is where we have some very differentiated offer with Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. And that's another big driver of some of that growth across our enterprise customers.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Mark.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you.\nMark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: We'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi, everyone. That was some quarter. I'm tempted to ask about the strength in Windows, which I know you don't talk about much and don't get much questions about. But really since we've launched, the question that I get by far the most is around the long-term margin potential in Azure. And with the gross margins being as good as they were this quarter, without giving us long-term guidance, is there any reason to believe that the long-term operating margins in Azure couldn't be \u2013 we just saw AWS put up a mid-20s operating margin. Is there anything structural that would lead us to believe that you couldn't do something in that range? Or how should we think about the long-term framework for that business? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I'll start, Adam. The one thing I'd say is when I think about the long-term margin, I actually think of the long-term margin across our cloud. I mean, when we even make our CapEx decisions, which is one of the drivers of margin, we think of first of all, first party equals third party. A lot of what we do even in Windows, mostly people don't recognize it, but one of the most important services we run is Windows Update as a cloud service. And so we have a lot of value that is across the board cloud services, whether it's Xbox Live, Windows Update, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and of course all of the Azure services. And we're going to build scale across all of them. And so we would not \u2013 in fact, we will be very aggressive in taking margin in one place, which is different as we see a path to margin in a different spot. That's something that we want to make sure we follow more our opportunity in a customer across the board versus trying to micromanage to certain margins in very specific opportunities, because we think that it's the integrated ability for us to deliver value is which I think long term is what the customers expect of Microsoft.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I would just add that as we think about that long-term trajectory, our ability to continue to improve margins in our SaaS portfolio and our PaaS portfolio and IaaS portfolio still exists. And our ability to blend them into interesting products that solve customer solutions, which may not even be priced as the component parts, is I think how we think about, especially in our solution areas that Satya talks about, how we talk about delivering it to a customer. So while I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow the core margin, I do think for us in particular, it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately.\nAdam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Adam. Thank you. We'll go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. And thanks for taking my question. My question is on the Gaming business. Given the even larger focus you're putting on this segment in the near-term, how quickly or in what timeframe do you think Gaming revenue could grow at or above the average gaming industry growth rate of mid to high-single digits? And I know you don't break out segment margins, but could you give us a sense of how you think about Gaming from a normalized contribution margin perspective relative to MPC and your overall company-wide margins, excluding the one-time Xbox launch effects? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: I can start again. I would say from a Gaming perspective, one of the bigger changes that has happened in the last, I would say, couple of years is one, of course the vibrancy of the Xbox Live network across the PC and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like Minecraft. And once you have the network, you have plenty of different opportunities. In particular, we now have a subscription offer with Game Pass that's off to a good very good start and our goal is to be able to have essentially a Netflix for games, so that we can have the game subscriptions that people can use across all of the devices that they play in. The other area is streaming. As you know, there is game playing and game watching and there is secular growth on both fronts. And we feel very, very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in Mixer. So that's another opportunity that we believe will shape in addition to things like e-sports and so on. So it's the totality of that. And one of the numbers that I did put in my script was that 20% growth in what we call software and services, that's perhaps a leading indicator of where we think the opportunity lies. These are early days for us, but that said, that's probably one of the key numbers to watch as we make progress and execute.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And because of that, you're actually already seeing that impact in the MPC gross margins. Even this quarter is a great example. There was material improvement in gross margin in that segment, and a lot of that was actually due to the higher margins that we have structurally in that software and services revenue from Xbox. And as I believe, the industry that Satya is talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network, you can expect that margin profile as well of our traditional, more hardware-focused Xbox to evolve, to be a real combination of those two things going forward. And structurally, that would of course have higher operating margin.\nMichael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you very much.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thanks. We'll take next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. The conversation we have on around Azure and adoption there seems to be changing with customers, where they seem to be seeking a deeper relationship with you guys now, given that your maturity has increased quite a bit over the last few quarters. Can you talk to that? Is that something that just I picked up, or is that what you're seeing in your conversations as well? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Hopefully, we picked it up a lot earlier than you did. But we have. So we do have a very different dialogue. You think about it, all of the customers that we have worked with, we have always worked with them historically even in our server days. But to your point, Raimo, I think what has happened is the change, even in the financial services, the segments that you all represent, the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed. In the past we participated, but a lot of Tier 1 workloads were not on Microsoft stack, whereas now, a lot of Tier 1 workloads are in fact increasingly on Microsoft cloud. And so to me, that represents a qualitative change, and so the type of dialogue we have, whether it's with an auto company or a financial services company or a retail company, is much deeper, much broader. And I would use the word we are deeply partnering with them. It's no longer just simple vendor relationships, because as they are trying to build their own software capability, they need a trusted partner who's more interested in making sure that they build their own technology capability. And that's what we're investing in.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And I would say, Raimo, a way to think about this is we've always had that trusted relationship, which we're incredibly proud of as a company with our enterprise customers. The investments we've made over the past years are about hiring the type of talent that can go and sit with a customer and drive the customer's successful outcomes of the projects they deploy. And that's what we mean. It's about the investment we've made in capability, the evolution of the product and its innovation. And I think using and trying to continue to earn the customer trust to deliver these world-class workloads. So I do think this is really an output of multiple years of concentration on delivering that capability.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Raimo. Jessie, we'll have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Satya, I was curious. You've made a number of announcements with Adobe over the last year or so. And it seems like Microsoft's product and Adobe's products are getting more intertwined. And just curious from your perspective, if you could just maybe give us some insights into where you see the big opportunities to work with a vendor like Adobe and what are the go to market actions that you're seeing being more successful? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe. And as you said, Adobe and Microsoft have partnered. In fact, across our entire histories in many of the areas, but increasingly across of the creative cloud and their Document Cloud as well as their Experience Cloud, we have plenty going on. In fact, we are very excited about what we are doing with our devices and Adobe and with Windows because I think Windows and Windows 10 Creators Update is the ideal platform for all of the creators in the world because of the innovation in Windows and the innovation in devices, both Surface Book as well as our OEM devices. So that's one area that I think you will see. I would love if you're an illustrator or a Photoshop user, you should just check out the dial support that they have in Surface, which just is beautiful. And then you go to Office 365. We have a partnership with them on e-signatures. We have good interoperability between our respective document clouds. That will in fact continue. And then on the creative side or on the experience side, in fact we are adding a lot of data and AI capability, which is obviously key to Adobe as an ISV. So we're looking forward to the, ultimately the impact all this has with customers in terms of their ability to take advantage of our respective value and for them to be able to benefit from it all. And so these kinds of partnerships, whether it's with Adobe or others, we are very focused on making sure that ISVs and partners have success on our platforms. And that's sort of our core heritage, and that's something that we want to absolutely focus on.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks Ross.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Ross.\nChris Suh - Microsoft Corp.: So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you so much.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. It was a strong finish to a record fiscal year. We delivered more than $125 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our Commercial Cloud business is the largest in the world surpassing $38 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 63%. I\u2019m proud of what we've accomplished over the last 12 months, and I'm energized by the tremendous opportunity ahead. Every day, we work alongside our customers to help them build their own digital capability, creating new businesses with them, innovating with them, and earning their trust. This commitment to our customers\u2019 success is resulting in deeper partnerships, larger multiyear cloud agreements, and growing momentum across every layer of our differentiated technology stack from application infrastructure to data and AI to business process to productivity and collaboration. Now, I will briefly highlight our innovation and momentum. In a world where every company is a software company, developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation across every organization, and GitHub is their home. GitHub is used by more than 36 million developers as well as the largest enterprises, including the majority of the Fortune 50. And we\u2019re investing to build the complete toolchain for developers, independent of language, framework, and cloud. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most popular code editing tools in the world. With Azure DevOps, you could build, test, and deploy code to any platform; and with Azure PlayFab, we have LiveOps, a complete backend platform to optimize engagement and interaction in real-time. We are building Azure as the world's computer addressing customers\u2019 real world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. We\u2019ve 54 data Center regions, more than any other cloud provider, and we were the first in Middle East and in Africa. Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge spanning identity, management, security, and infrastructure This year, we introduced new cloud to the edge services and devices from Azure Data Box Edge to Azure Stack HCI to Azure Connect, bringing the full power of Azure to where data is generated. Azure Sphere is the first-of-a-kind edge solution to secure the more than 9 billion MCU powered endpoints coming online each year. And now, IoT plug-and-play seamlessly connects IoT devices to the cloud without having to write a single line of embedded code. Azure is the most open cloud, and in this quarter, we expanded our partnerships with Oracle, Red Hat, and VMware, to make the technologies and tools customers already have first class on Azure. Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities across the customers' entire data estate. The variety, velocity, and the volume of data is increasing, and we\u2019re bringing hyper-scale capabilities to relational database services with Azure SQL database, new analytics support in cosmos DB enables customers to build and manage analytics workloads that run real-time over globally distributed data, and we offer the most comprehensive cloud analytics from Azure Data Factory to Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Power BI. The quintessential characteristic of any application being built in 2019 and beyond will be AI. We are democratizing AI infrastructure tools and services with Azure Cognitive Services, the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, so developers can embed the ability to see, hear, respond, translate, reason, and more into their applications. And this quarter, we introduced a new speech-to-text, search, vision, and decision capabilities. New updates to Azure ML streamline the building, training, and deployment of machine learning models bringing a no-code approach to machine learning. Our differentiated approach from developer tools and infrastructure to data and analytics to AI is driving growth. The world's leading companies trust Azure for their mission-critical workloads, including more than 95% of the Fortune 500. And just yesterday AT&T chose our cloud in one of the largest cloud commitments to date. Now let's move up the stack to business process. We are redefining business processes with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform with modern, modular, extensible, and AI driven applications. Dynamics 365 uniquely enables any organization to create digital feedback loops and take data from one system and use it to optimize the outcomes of another, enabling any business to become an AI first business. Our open data initiative with SAP and Adobe builds on this promise giving customers like Coke, HP, Unilever, and Walmart a single 360 view of their customers built on one data model and on one data lake eliminating data silos and driving real-time insights at scale. This year, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where systems of record are converted into systems of engagement and intelligence. The citizen developer movement is here, and we\u2019re empowering it. 500 new -- 500 million new apps will get created in the next five years and more than the total created in the last 40. Businesses will need to empower domain experts with tools to create applications as well as robotic process automation to streamline and customize workflow like service monitoring and time and expense tracking. Our Power Platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps, & Flow is the only solution of its kind in the industry. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation, and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive platform. Chevron has gone from 80 users of Power Apps to 5,500 in a year and now has over 200 apps in production. This quarter, we introduced AI Builder, adding AI capabilities like object recognition to any Power App. And with Power BI, we are the leader in business intelligence in the cloud with more than 25 million models hosted on the service and 12 million queries processed each hour. We are enabling our customers to digitize not only their business processes but to bridge the physical and digital worlds with our investments in mixed reality cloud, spanning HoloLens 2, Azure Spatial Anchors and Dynamics 365 applications. We are seeing traction in every industry from manufacturing to retail to gaming. Airbus alone is pursuing more than 300 use cases from training to design to remote assistance. All this innovation is fueling rapid growth, with more than 90% of the Fortune 500 using Dynamics 365 or Power Platform. Now to LinkedIn. People are an organization\u2019s most valuable asset. Our strong Talent portfolio from Talent Solutions and Talent Insights, to employee engagement with Glint to LinkedIn Learning enables every organization to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs market. New capabilities help job seekers find and land more relevant and higher paying jobs through alerts, deeper insights and a new suite of interview prep tools, contributing to another quarter of record job postings. Marketing Solutions is now our fastest growing business, with new brand and community building tools that make it easier for marketers to connect with LinkedIn\u2019s 645 million members. And we are enabling every business to drive a culture of relationship selling and take full advantage of their social networks, with the combination of Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. All this innovation contributed to another record year for LinkedIn, driven by all-time high engagement across the platform. Now, turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud. It empowers everyone, including the 2 billion firstline workers around the world, with an integrated, secure, AI-infused experience on any device. It's the only comprehensive productivity and collaboration and communications solution that integrates with an organization\u2019s critical business process workflows. Multinationals from L'Oreal and Walgreens Boots Alliance, to the largest chemical producer in the world, BASF, all chose Microsoft 365 this year. And over the last two quarters our premium offerings gained momentum, with S&P Global, CenturyLink and KPMG all selecting Microsoft 365 E5. Microsoft Teams has had a breakout year. Teams now has more than 13 million daily active users and 19 million weekly active users. It brings together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of Office apps, and the business process workflows, into a single, integrated user experience scaffolding, eliminating the need for discreet apps that only increase an organization\u2019s security and compliance exposure. And we\u2019re broadening our opportunity, bringing Teams to new and underpenetrated markets including healthcare, hospitality and retail, as well as firstline workers. We are empowering them with mobile tools in Teams, like shift scheduling and priority notifications. And we are infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to enable new automation, prediction, translation and insights capabilities. Meetings are more inclusive in Teams, presentations are more accessible in PowerPoint, videos more searchable in Stream and emails more relevant in Outlook. And with Workplace Analytics and Microsoft Search, we take your relationships, schedules and activities and distill insights and knowledge, to help people work smarter, not longer. We are investing in cybersecurity to protect customers in today\u2019s \u201czero trust\u201d environment. Microsoft is the only company that offers end-to-end security, spanning identity, device endpoints, information, cloud applications as well as infrastructure. It starts with Azure Active Directory and builds with three new services we introduced this year: Microsoft Threat Protection, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Confidential Computing. We expanded our family of category creating Surface devices this year, including the new Surface Go and Surface Hub 2S. And Windows 10 is active on more than 800 million devices, with accelerating adoption in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. Finally, gaming. We are investing to empower the world\u2019s two billion gamers to play the games they want, with anyone, anywhere on any device with our new game streaming service, Project xCloud, which will enter public trials this fall. Xbox Live Monthly Active Users increased to a record 65 million, with the highest number of mobile and PC users-to-date. We are bringing one of the world\u2019s most popular video games to a new generation of mobile gamers with Minecraft Earth and mixed reality. And we nearly doubled our first party game studios this year to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing subscription services like Xbox Game Pass, now available on both console and PC. In closing, I\u2019m optimistic of what\u2019s ahead. We are accelerating our innovation to deliver differentiated value to customers across the cloud and the edge from GitHub to Azure to Dynamics 365 to Microsoft 365 as well as Xbox Game Pass. We are investing in the right secular trends to expand our opportunity and we are working to earn our customers\u2019 trust every day. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter revenue was $33.7 billion, up 12% and 14% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency. Operating income increased 20% and 24% in constant currency. This quarter we transferred intangible properties from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States and Ireland, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.6 billion. When adjusting for this and the net benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the fourth quarter of FY18, earnings per share was $1.37, increasing 21% and 24% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results, which drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes. Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to grow. In FY19, we closed a record number of multi-million dollar commercial cloud agreements, with material growth in the number of $10 million plus Azure agreements. Commercial bookings growth was significantly ahead of expectations, increasing 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, our contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion, up 25% year-over-year, reflecting our continued momentum and growing long-term customer commitment. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue in the next 12 months. Even with the higher mix of larger, long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings, commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $34.1 billion, up 13% and 16% in constant currency. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 90%. Commercial Cloud revenue was $11 billion, growing 39% and 42% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points year-over-year to 65%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. The Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix shift to commercial licensing and OEM. In line with expectations, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by 1 point. Operating expenses grew slightly ahead of expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, LinkedIn, and GitHub. Operating margins expanded again this quarter, as a result of strong revenue growth, improving gross margins, and disciplined decisions we\u2019ve made over the past 5 years to invest in strategic and high growth areas. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11 billion, increasing 14% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by both our cloud and on-premises businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, including roughly 4 points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition that benefited both our cloud and on-premises businesses. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 31% and 34% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as ARPU growth from our customers\u2019 continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings. Office 365 commercial seats grew 23% on a prior year comparable that included the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office Consumer revenue grew 6% and 8% in constant currency, with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew 34.8 million. Our Dynamics business grew 12% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 45% and 48% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 28% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 22%, with record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 20% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix. Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 25% and 31% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.4 billion, increasing 19% and 21% in constant currency. Our on-premises server business drove our better than expected performance. Continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid solutions drove strong server products and cloud services revenue growth, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency on a significant revenue base. Azure revenue increased 64% and 68% in constant currency with another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business and continued moderation in our per-user business. And our on-premises server business grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, with roughly 4 points from stronger than expected demand ahead of end of support for SQL and Windows server 2008, as well as continued strength across our hybrid offerings, premium versions, and GitHub. Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was flat year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 23% and 24% in constant currency, driven by on-going investments in Cloud and AI engineering and GitHub, as well as revenue driven expenses given the strength of the quarter. Operating income increased 15% and 19% in constant currency. Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $11.3 billion, increasing 4% and 6% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better than expected performance in Windows more than offset lower than expected Gaming and Search revenue. In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 8%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 18%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by healthy Windows 10 demand, strong momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support, and roughly 4 points of benefit from increased inventory levels due to uncertainty around tariffs. Therefore, inventory levels ended the quarter above the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 16% in constant currency, with strong double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 14% and 17% in constant currency driven by strength in our commercial segment, particularly in the U.S., Japan, and Canada. Search revenue ex TAC increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower than expected volume. In Gaming, revenue declined 10% and 8% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower console sales and monetization across third party titles. Xbox software and services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency with the tough comparable from a third-party title in the prior year offsetting continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to our higher margin Windows businesses. Operating expenses declined 2% and 1% in constant currency. As a result, operating income grew 18% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including finance leases were up sequentially to $5.3 billion driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.1 billion. Cash flow from operations increased 41% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections and roughly 8 points of benefit from tax payments made in the prior year. Free cash flow was $12 billion and increased 62% year-over-year, reflecting strong operating cash flows and the timing of cash payments for PP&E. For the fiscal year, we generated over $52 billion in operating cash flow and $38 billion in free cash flow, driven by improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses, as well as operating improvements to better optimize cash flow. Other income was $191 million, higher than anticipated due to recording of mark-to-market gains. As a reminder, under the recently adopted accounting standards for financial investments, we\u2019re required to recognize unrealized gains or losses on our equity portfolio. As a result, we expect increased quarterly volatility in other income and expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 16%. And finally, this quarter, we returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 45%, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $30 billion for the full fiscal year. Now let\u2019s move to our outlook, starting with Q1, where we expect another strong commercial quarter. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and more Personal Computing revenue and total company COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point.  In our commercial business, we expect continued customer demand to drive commercial unearned revenue up 11% to 12% year-over-year with volatility based on contract type. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be up slightly on a sequential basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion driven by double-digit growth in Office commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect a balance of strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business. Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings, as well as the continued benefit from the end of support for SQL Server and Windows Server 2008. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $11 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be slightly ahead of the PC market driven by healthy commercial demand. Surface revenue will decline slightly year over year driven by product lifecycle transitions. Search ex TAC revenue growth should be roughly in line with Q4. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline year over year at a similar rate to Q4 as we move through the end of this console generation and a challenging Xbox software and services comparable from a third-party title in the prior year. Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expenses should offset each other. Next, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full-year expected rate of 17% due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter. And finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making a $4.7 billion tax payment related to TCJA transition tax and the Q4 transfer of intangible property. Now I would like to share some comments on FY20. First, FX. Assuming that current rates remain stable, we expect FX to reduce full-year revenue and COGS growth by 1 point. FX should have no impact on operating expense growth. Next, revenue. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth with another year of strong performance and continued momentum in our commercial business. As a reminder, our commercial licensing and OEM Pro businesses in the second half of the year will be impacted by a comparable that benefitted from the end of support of SQL server 2008, Windows server 2008, and Windows 7, as well as transactional strength in Japan. We expect revenue in our gaming business to be down slightly year-over-year as double-digit growth in Xbox Software and Services will be offset by declining console sales. We do expect a stronger H2 than H1 in Gaming as we work through a third-party title comparison. And as a reminder, an increasing number of large, long-term Azure contracts will drive more quarterly volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth. Next, commercial cloud gross margin. Revenue mix will continue to shift to our Azure consumption-based services. Even with this headwind, we expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to be up slightly as we again drive meaningful improvement in Azure gross margin. Capital expenditures will increase to meet the growing demand for our cloud services. Finally, on operating expenses, we will continue to invest given our strong execution, growing competitive position, and our significant ambition in high growth areas. Investment in areas like Cloud through AI and GitHub, Business Applications through Dynamics, Power Platform, and LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security, and Surface as well as Gaming should result in operating expense growth of 11% to 12%. Even with these strategic investments, the continued shift to our cloud business, and our very strong finish to FY19, we expect double-digit operating income growth as well as stable operating margins. We are looking forward to FY20. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We will now move over to Q&A. With respect for others on the call, we request the participants to please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a really strong FY19. I wanted to focus on the Office 365. If I\u2019m looking at this right, I think you guys saw acceleration in the Office 365 commercial business and in the kind of recipe to getting there seems to have changed a little bit of that as more sort of positive pricing versus just the seat growth. Is there a changing dynamic in kind of what\u2019s pushing growth there, because we had seen the F1 SKU and the frontline workers bringing down the price point a little bit. It looks like the pricing actually improved this quarter. How should we think about sort of the dynamics, what\u2019s going to be driving growth for Office 365 into FY20 and beyond?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Keith. Let me walk through a little bit of this, because there are some new behaviors that I think are important this quarter, but the fundaments that you talked about are relatively unchanged. We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business. That\u2019s happening not just because of frontline workers, but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base. We did see ARPU growth this quarter. It wasn\u2019t as much different from the -- from past quarters. We continue to see improvement from E3 and E5 transitions, saw both again. And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance, particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter, which was great to see. What you saw a little bit and I referred to it was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that\u2019s happening because it's got two important and positive trends that underlie it. The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments. When you see longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. And so, we saw longer commitment and we\u2019ve got a little bit more recognition in the quarter, and so you saw then revenue grow a little faster. The other thing that we saw is increasing focus as we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us, it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions. And so, the fact that we then -- we\u2019re often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts. When that happens, it's almost like you\u2019re adding new products and new value and a lot of that gets recognized faster in-quarter when you see that happen. And so, when you have a dynamic where you\u2019re seeing longer contracts plus you\u2019re able to sell more and new things, and I think different conversations around Microsoft 365, it was a good execution by the team and I think a recognition of the value that we continue to put into that what we believe is our hero -- hero experience.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Sounds great.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Keith. Operator, we will move to next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations not only on the great end to the year, but confidence into next -- not next quarter and next year in terms of growth, investment, et cetera. We met recently at E3 with your gaming team and heard a lot about the steps that were being taken. Satya, can you give us more color, explanation -- excuse me, on how you see the gaming business fitting into the overall company's direction over next the few years, specifically how does gaming change? How does the synergy between gaming and the rest of the business change? How should we think about that overall mix and that whole [ph] morph that\u2019s going to occur? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Sure. First, I\u2019d say we are in gaming because of what we believe are going to be the secular changes in the gaming addressable market for us. We\u2019ve always had a gaming position with console as well as the PC, but going forward, we think that any endpoint can in fact be a great endpoint for high-end games, which is where our structural position is. And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming, we\u2019ve a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming, in spite of all the success we\u2019ve had over the years in gaming. Now the second point is that it builds on the rest of the cloud investment. So, if you think about what we are doing with xCloud, it's a hero workload on top of Azure. So when we think about capital allocation, what\u2019s happening in the Cloud, what\u2019s happening in the Edge, how we build the network to optimize for streaming the same infrastructure, for example, is what Sony has decided to use as well, and be on Azure as well as use our AI capability. So, you will see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. I appreciate it and congrats.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much. I had a couple questions for Amy. Just thinking through with the Azure mix becoming an ever bigger portion of IC revenue and when you factor in continued gross margin expansion that you continue to show in Azure, how should we think about the gross margin potential of IC overall? And I guess, I also wanted to ask about the build out of data centers related to the cloud build out, how do we think about your points of presence today from a coverage perspective, if you will, versus the regional -- the revenue pockets that you\u2019re targeting over the next few years? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Great. Heather, let me -- on gross margin, over a long-term period and intelligent cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over long-term. Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid percentage and execution, which help to offset some of that. So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number. But of course a lot of opportunity in terms of gross margin dollar growth and of course operating margin dollar growth as we move forward. When it comes to our build out, Heather, I tend to think two components. The majority of our capital expenditures is actually in server equipment, it's new capacity. It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build out. We will of course continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. We do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to -- be able to get those up and running quite quickly. But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you very much, Amy.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Heather. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you. Satya, you mentioned the AT&T deal that was announced, I think earlier this week. IBM also had an announcement with AT&T. Oracle has been a long time partner with AT&T in the cloud as well. I don\u2019t want to dwell on AT&T in particular, but I do think it's interesting that a few different large scale cloud players are around the table there. So as you see more of these very large deals out there and Amy mentioned the increase in $10 million deals. How often are those multi-cloud deals and companies taking that sort of approach versus once that are committing to Microsoft and how do you navigate that landscape?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, when I think overall, you all I think do a good job of tracking what is the public cloud competition and that\u2019s the competition we pay most attention to. And in this context I think we see a mix. There a few of us who are at scale in public cloud who are very competitive, and anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. When someone thinks that only using one cloud, we're definitely one of the names. And in the case of AT&T we were the only public cloud in there. And so that\u2019s why we highlighted -- they highlighted us and we highlighted that in our quarterly announcement.\nAmy Hood: And I will think general what we see, especially as contract gets larger, for us the opportunity under Tier 1 workloads for us to really see TAM growth. It's just expansive. And so, Jennifer, listen, I kind of think about this as we\u2019ve a incredibly strong footprint inside existing enterprises today, that footprint and you can see it in our results. Customers are relying on us for not only that footprint, but as they continue to expand to sit under the Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before. And so we, of course, see multi-cloud in a lot of our larger accounts, but this type of significant commitments is an opportunity, I think, you will continue to see us execute well on.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Jen. Operator, we will take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Amy, I\u2019ve got a question about the Windows business. A couple of the metrics, 18% Windows OEM Pro and 16% on the volume licensing side were extraordinary. I know you called out a couple of, call it, one-time issues around inventory levels and an uptick in in-quarter revs. But I wanted to ask you two questions. How much of a tail do you think we\u2019ve left on the Win7 to Win10 migration? Is it too cautious to say that there's really just two quarters of that tailwind left? And, secondly, on the volume licensing or commercial and cloud services segment, do you think that can, in fiscal '20 contribute to your overall double-digit growth? Thanks a lot.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. And I will actually combine these, because really those are fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support. There's, I think a recognized momentum with Windows 10 if deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value prop. We worked hard and I think Satya mentioned some of the new features as we continue to invest on security for all of our products. One of the places I think it often resonates the most is with Windows 10 and inside that value. The OEM Pro number as I talked about was impacted by a number of factors, but what we\u2019ve seen is over the past three or four quarters, a pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts and chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs. That performance certainly has some end of support impact to it as we've talked about before. I think, in general, what we've seen in prior releases is, it does extend a bit past the deadline, especially in our small and mid-sized business customers, and it's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have. And so, we will see some extension pass the line, we certainly have seen three or four quarters of that and we certainly expect H1 to remain strong. The more important part around the security management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit, because it's the same thing we saw in Office. The Microsoft 365 value prop to customers, especially in the second half of the year and particularly in Q4, has three components. It has Office 365, it has EMS, and it has its Windows 10 commercial component. The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success and our motion and overall being able to sell the Microsoft 360 value prop. It was a good quarter for that. We\u2019ve seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that. I expect that to continue, although you will have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is, it has a little bit more 606 impact than we\u2019ve felt it's an on-prem product. And so there will be volatility in this number, but the consistent theme of being double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think -- and I do expect to continue.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, terrific. Thanks, Amy.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Karl. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPhilip Winslow: Hey. Thanks, guys for taking my question and congrats on a great close to a great year. I just wanted to focus in on M 365, particularly Satya your comments on Microsoft Teams. Really kind of two components for this question. How do you think about sort of why customers are adopting Teams, especially the larger ones that you highlighted at Ignite Conference. Is it the fact, let's say, single app with those combined features you talked about or is it the broader, you call it, Office experience? And then, I guess a question for Amy then off of that. When you think about sort of the relevance of Teams on a going forward basis to keep this migration up, E1, E3, E5 and then plus those add-ons that are associated with Teams like Calling etcetera, how critical is Teams to this -- to the long-term, call it, like, price migration here at Office and M 365?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. So, overall, I think there's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we\u2019re seeing. And I think, in fact unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. Office has obviously had very, very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly, but each of them was a singular tool. Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind. But Teams is -- transcends all that. It's the communications tool, it's the collaboration tool, it's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process. And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line. The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers. Whereas now, we actually have specific value, which is in fact very valuable to those first line workers. And the thing that we have realized is, that businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first line worker productivity. So we\u2019re in a very early innings of it, but we are pretty excited. The one other benefit, to sort of tease off with some of the comments Amy was making is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. And Teams in some sense helps them a lot, because it builds on all the rest of the investment they\u2019ve made already in Office 365. And so we see that benefit even on that front.\nAmy Hood: And I think it's an important component of our M 365 value, but it's really not outsized. I mean, we\u2019ve all these components value, that's really that\u2019s been the secret of what customers look and see. They see Teams that can not only change what Satya talked about, but also develop culture change in terms of employees being able to be involved and collaborate regardless of the org chart and that is what you're going to see. When we have 500 million new applications built in the next five years, you're going to see and I believe Teams to be one of the major interfaces through which that experience and business process reinvention will happen. Teams really expand multiple categories, so I wouldn't think of adjusted productivity or even just collab or meetings but as an interface. As you see business process reinvention occur, I do think of this as the surface through which many people will experience that. And so, I would ask to try to expand your thinking on this one, it's not just Office or needed to be an Office, it's really about having employees fundamentally experience Microsoft in a different way day-to-day.\nSatya Nadella: Yes and I would point to the conference we just finished and some of the demos, and I think the customer demos, in particular, I would say, that will sort of probably give you the best feel for how people look at this in terms of the deployment characteristics.\nPhilip Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Phil. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Amy, you\u2019re mentioning large and long-term Azure contracts. I'm wondering as we consider this robust 25% growth in your commercial bookings this quarter, roughly how many points are coming from that -- from any tailwind of the longer duration types of contracts? And then, Satya, I wanted to ask you regarding the recent partnership with AT&T. Some media report said it was worth over $2 billion. Wondering if there's some hyperbole there in the media, or is this an example of how Microsoft can play in every line of the company's OpEx budgets today?\nSatya Nadella: I will just take the second one then you can go on. I mean I think it is a very significant deal. I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms, it is the largest commercial deal that we\u2019ve signed of the size and we see -- we\u2019ve line of sight to many more such deals.\nAmy Hood: When we think about bookings growth, I'm not sure -- for me -- break it down into two pieces, which is I think about bookings which were very good this quarter, has two fundamental motions. There's a motion around renewals and there's a motion around new. Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone and being the only component of the new. And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we\u2019ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction. So, while these long-term large contracts will add volatility to that number, if you look at our -- see in our balance of $91 billion and see that that also grew 25% year-over-year, you will get a sense that it certainly wasn't alone in its impact for the year.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks and congrats from me as well. I wanted to zone in on Dynamics. There, you obviously like, you\u2019re playing in applications and we've seen other vendors kind of do SaaS applications. If you look at Dynamics Online, you now on my math kind of around $2 billion, but still growing at a clip that organically, not many others have achieved. It's now bigger than your on-premise business. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? And is there -- what are the ways to kind of keep in -- how did you achieve that over this scale and what are the drivers going forward? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, we\u2019re very, very excited about the progress again in the last fiscal year around Dynamics 365. Both the traditional business process applications themselves have become much more modular and a much more modern and we\u2019ve a very disruptive business model as well that goes with it. And so, therefore, we\u2019re becoming much more competitive with very large customers deploying whether it's sales or operations. The other exciting thing is we\u2019ve this entire new class of applications and I talked about this even into this week's conference, which is these AI-first modules, whether it's for sales, for marketing, for customer service or this Customer 360. And these are modules that there isn't an installed base of those anywhere, no competition even exist. So in other words, we can in fact have these modules get deployed in commercial customers even on top of existing business applications. And so we feel that we\u2019ve plenty of opportunity ahead. Again, this is a place where we\u2019re a very low share player. And so the fact that we will become a very competitive supplier of this technology at a time where the world needs more business process automation, we feel good about the opportunity ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: All right. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we will take our last question now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you for taking question here. I wanted to drill down in the Commercial Cloud gross margins. They were up 200 basis points sequentially, 600 basis points year-over-year to 65%. I guess, my question here is how sustainable are the cloud gross margins now that you're at this $40 billion plus scale, or were there some kind of one-time benefits we should think about in the quarter that helped you there? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: There were not any one-time benefits in this quarter that helped us. This is really about seeing improvement in some of our largest services and continue to see improvement year-over-year in the largest services. What we said for FY20 and certainly in Q1 as we expected to be up sequentially in Q1 and we will continue to get some headwind because of the strong Azure IaaS and PaaS growth we expect through the year, but we certainly think that Azure fundamental gross margin improvement will help offset that next year.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer: That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We appreciate you joining us, and look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks.\nA - Amy Hood: Thanks, everyone.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, all. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. It was another strong quarter with double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth, the result of picking the right secular trends, accelerating innovation and most importantly, relentlessly focusing on our customers\u2019 success. Our trusted, extensible cloud platform spanning application infrastructure, data & AI, productivity and collaboration, as well as business applications enables every organization to create their own intelligent systems and experiences to compete and grow. Now I\u2019ll briefly highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our business. Microsoft 365 empowers everyone from the largest multinationals to small businesses; from knowledge workers to first line workers with an integrated secure, compliant experience on any device. It is the only comprehensive productivity collaboration and communications solution that integrates with an organization\u2019s business process workflows. Microsoft Teams brings together everything a team needs, messaging, video conferencing, meetings and collaboration into a single integrated user experience scaffolding, eliminating the need for discreet apps that only increase an organization\u2019s security and compliance exposure. 91 of the Fortune 100 use Teams, and more than 150 organizations have over 10,000 active users. And we are expanding Teams to new industries like healthcare, with priority notifications for patient care and the ability to securely access patient records. Cybersecurity is a central challenge, and Microsoft is the clear leader in cloud security with our unparalleled operational security posture, and our growing portfolio of security and compliance solutions, spanning identity, device endpoints, email, information, cloud applications as well as infrastructure. In financial services, National Bank of Canada, BNP Paribas, Refinitiv a joint venture between Thomson Reuters and Blackrock, all chose Microsoft 365 for our advanced security and compliance. We expanded Microsoft Threat Protection to include the Mac and manage vulnerabilities in third-party applications, providing the best defense for customers\u2019 heterogeneous environments. And we introduced two first-of-their-kind services: Azure Sentinel analyzes security signals at massive scale across an entire organization, using AI to detect, investigate and respond rapidly to threats. Microsoft Threat Experts is a new cyberthreat hunting service that provides access to our security experts on demand. All this innovation is driving growth. Office 365 Commercial now has 180 million users. Our EMS installed base reached 100 million. And the Outlook apps on iOS and Android surpassed more than 100 million users for the first time this quarter. We expanded our Surface family of devices with the Surface Hub 2S, which brings together Teams, Windows, and our category creating Surface hardware to power teamwork for organizations like Volvo, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Northwestern University and NASA Jet Propulsion Labs. Finally, Windows 10 is now active on more than 800 million devices and continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. Moving to business applications. Today, traditional systems of record and engagement are often siloed, limiting the value of an organization\u2019s most important asset, its data. Dynamics 365 solves this challenge connecting all their systems and creating digital feedback loops, enabling any organization to become a true AI-first company. The Open Data Initiative we announced last year with Adobe and SAP delivers on this promise, and is already enabling customers like Unilever to unify their business data across all their lines-of-business applications to unlock new AI-driven insights. Personalization is increasingly key to every organization\u2019s marketing strategy enabling them to effectively engage customers, tailor their experiences and increase return on investment. Tivoli is one of the world\u2019s oldest amusement parks is using AI in Dynamics 365 to help personalize marketing campaigns and transform how their first-line workers engage with guests, reducing churn and increasing customer loyalty. And we are not stopping there. We are leading in two emerging categories: robotic process automation and mixed reality. Our Power Platform brings together robotic process automation with self-service analytics and no code-low code app development. Recent updates enable citizen developers to build higher-quality PowerApps faster and easier and along with new capabilities in Power BI empower customers like SNCF, France\u2019s national railway, to create a more data-centric culture. Our new HoloLens 2 is the most advanced, intelligent edge device available and in combination with Dynamics 365 and new Azure mixed reality services enables organizations like PACCAR and Chevron to digitize physical spaces and interactions to empower their first-line employees with the right information at the right time in the context of their business process work. All this innovation is driving growth. Revenue from our Power Platform grew triple-digits year-over-year, and for the first time, more than 50 percent of our Dynamics revenue was driven by the cloud. Moving to LinkedIn. LinkedIn again exceeded expectations across all lines of business driven by record levels of engagement in the feed, content shared across the platform, the messages sent this quarter. Marketing Solutions was up 46% year-over-year, and customers are relying on our new Pages experience and audience targeting capabilities to connect with LinkedIn\u2019s nearly 630 million members. We saw record job postings again this quarter and are making it easier for job seekers to find more relevant and higher paying jobs and get personalized salary insights. We have the most comprehensive solution for every organization to manage and engage their most important resource, their talent. New tools in Glint empower managers to quickly analyze and action feedback to have the greatest impact on team performance. And with our combination of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, LinkedIn Learning, and Glint, we are helping employers access data driven insights to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs marketplace. Now let\u2019s talk about Azure. From the outset, we took a differentiated approach to the cloud to meet the real world needs of customers. Our architectural advantage is a clear reason for our success. Azure is the only true hybrid hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge. Operational sovereignty is increasingly critical to customers, and Azure uniquely provides consistency across development environments, operating models and technology stacks, whether connected or disconnected to the public cloud. And we\u2019re accelerating our innovation.  Azure Stack extends our hybrid differentiation, enabling customers like Airbus Defense and Space to build and run cloud applications at the edge. And now with our new Azure Stack HCI, customers can build and run virtualized applications on-premise in a consistent way. Azure Data Box Edge is a powerful new AI-enabled edge appliance that sits within a customer\u2019s environment in their data center or on a factory floor so that they can use AI to reason over data at the edge. More than 95% of the Fortune 500 run their workloads on our cloud, including TD Bank. And AT&T chose Azure to shape the future of 5G with computing at the edge. We are building Azure as the world\u2019s computer, with more global datacenter regions and now two in South Africa and more compliance certifications than any other cloud provider. And just last week we announced two new Azure government regions to meet the stringent requirements for maintaining the security and the integrity of classified US government workloads. Every organization needs an IoT strategy to manage the 20 billion connected devices coming online by 2020. Our comprehensive Azure IoT platform enables customers to build, manage and secure their connected devices, and our recently announced acquisition of Express Logic furthers our goal, bringing our cloud to more than 6 billion MCU-powered endpoints. BMW Group is partnering with us to speed the adoption of industrial IoT, both in automotive and more broadly in manufacturing, and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and Volkswagen both chose Azure to fuel their new connected car experiences. Data and analytics is the foundation for building an organization\u2019s AI capability, and we are investing to make Azure the best cloud for data estates from data warehousing to real-time stream analytics. Daimler chose Azure as its new platform for big data and advanced analytics, and third-party analysts affirm our price performance lead in this fast-growing space. And we are investing to make Azure the best place to build AI. This quarter we introduced new Azure Cognitive Services for fraud detection and image identification. Telefonica is using Azure AI services to create new intelligent experiences for their customers around the world and transform customer engagement. The developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation and we are committed to giving them the tools they need to be productive on any platform. GitHub surpassed 36 million registered users, and free private repositories expanded the opportunities for all developers, with private repo creation more than doubling this quarter. The new Visual Studio 2019 optimizes developer productivity and team collaboration. And I\u2019m excited to share more about how we are empowering developers at our Build conference in two weeks. Now to gaming. We are investing in content, community and cloud to capture our massive opportunity in gaming, delivering record user engagement again this quarter. Microsoft Game Stack brings together our tools and services to empower game developers from independent creators to the biggest game studios to build, operate and scale cloud-first games across mobile, PC and console. Our Xbox Live community now 63 million strong is key to our approach and we are enabling developers to reach these highly engaged gamers on iOS and Android for the first time. Our fast-growing gaming subscription service, Game Pass, is expanding our reach, bolstered by our growing pipeline of first-party content. And Project xCloud, our new game streaming service will be in public trials later this year. In closing, I\u2019m energized by our progress and incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead. Across all of our businesses, we are delivering differentiated value for customers and creating new categories of growth that position us well for the future. With that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Amy who will cover the financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy Hood : Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $30.6 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 18% in constant currency. Operating income increased 25% and 27% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 20% and 22% in constant currency. Our sales teams and partners delivered strong results across each of our segments, once again resulting in double-digit top and bottom-line growth. From a geographic perspective, most markets performed in line with our expectations, however, results in Japan were much stronger than we anticipated. In our Commercial business, cloud services strength drove our annuity mix to 90%, up 1 point year-over-year. Commercial unearned revenue was better than expected at $25.1 billion, up 19% and 20% in constant currency. Commercial bookings growth was strong, increasing 30% and 34% in constant currency.  Bookings growth was driven by healthy renewals on an expiration base that was over 20% larger than a year ago as well as an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, an increased mix of these larger, long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings will drive more volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth. Commercial Cloud revenue was $9.6 billion, growing 41% and 43% in constant currency, highlighted by healthy growth in the US, Western Europe, the UK, and Germany. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year over year to 63% driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Company gross margin percentage was 67%, ahead of our expectations, and up year over year primarily from an increase in margin in our More Personal Computing segment due to sales mix shift. FX reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS growth by 1 point in line with expectations. FX reduced operating expenses growth by 1 point, less than anticipated. Even with this headwind, operating expenses grew in line with expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency. Strong revenue growth, improving gross margins, and disciplined investment in strategic and high growth areas resulted in operating margin expansion. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $10.2 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by performance in Japan and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 30% and 31% in constant currency driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as ARPU growth from our customers\u2019 continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings. Office 365 commercial seats grew 27% and benefited from the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office consumer revenue grew 8% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations, with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 34.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 13% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 43% and 44% in constant currency. We saw continued progress in our Finance and Operations offering, with strong growth in customer billings and deployments. LinkedIn revenue increased 27% and 29% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions increased 24% as engagement once again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year over year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix. Operating expenses increased 4% and 6% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 28% and 30% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $9.7 billion, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 27% and 29% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 73% and 75% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments, partially offset by tempering growth in our per-user business. Our enterprise mobility installed base grew 53 percent to over 100 million seats. And our on- premises server business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, driven by the continued strength of our hybrid solutions, premium offerings, and GitHub, as well as increased transactional demand ahead of end of support for Windows Server and SQL Server 2008. Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly as the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue was partially offset by another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses increased 22% and 23% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, GitHub, and commercial sales capacity. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $10.7 billion, increasing 8% and 9% in constant currency as better than expected performance in Windows was partially offset by lower than expected Gaming revenue. In Windows, the overall PC market was stronger than we anticipated driven by improved chip supply that met both unfulfilled Q2 commercial and premium consumer demand as well as better than expected Q3 commercial demand. Therefore, OEM Pro revenue grew 15% and OEM Non-Pro revenue declined 1%. Inventory levels were within the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 18% and 20% in constant currency, with continued double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. Windows 10 deployments across new and existing devices remained healthy. In Gaming, revenue grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower than expected monetization across third party titles and console sales. Xbox software and services revenue grew 12% and 15% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth. Surface revenue grew 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across our consumer and commercial segments, particularly in Japan. Search revenue ex-TAC increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, primarily driven by Bing rate growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to higher margin products in Windows and Gaming. Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 25% and 28% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were down sequentially to $3.4 billion, and lower than initially planned, primarily due to normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of cloud infrastructure buildout. Cash paid for property, plant, and equipment was $2.6 billion. Cash flow from operations increased 11% year over year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $11 billion and increased 19% year over year, reflecting the timing of lower cash payments for property, plant, and equipment. Other income was $145 million, driven by interest income and net gains on derivatives and investments, offset partially by debt and finance lease expense. Our effective tax rate came in lower than anticipated at 16%. And finally, we returned $7.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 17%. Now let\u2019s move to next quarter\u2019s outlook. First on FX. Assuming the current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Second, we again expect customer demand and solid execution to drive continued strong performance across our commercial business in our largest quarter of the year. The expiry base will grow in Q4, but at a more moderated rate than in Q3 and we expect commercial unearned revenue to increase 36% to 37% sequentially. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should continue to improve year over year as material improvement in Azure gross margin will be partially offset by the continued mix of revenue towards Azure IaaS and PaaS services. Third, CapEx, our full year outlook remains unchanged. Therefore, we expect a sequential dollar increase in capital expenditures in Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing customer demand. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.55 billion and $10.75 billion. The Office commercial revenue growth rate will be slightly down sequentially as is normal for Q4 due to the high mix of cloud billings during this quarter. As a reminder, under ASC 606, a higher mix of cloud billings is reflected in more unearned revenue and less in-period revenue recognition. Dynamics should see another quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by Dynamics 365. LinkedIn revenue growth should be in the low 20\u2019s against a high prior year comparable. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $10.85 billion and $11.05 billion. In Azure, we expect continued strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business given the increasing in size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings should remain strong, and we expect continued benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows Server and SQL Server 2008, though as a reminder, the prior year comparable will impact the year over year growth rate. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.8 billion and $11.1 billion. In Windows, overall OEM growth rates should normalize, with revenue growth roughly in line with the PC market. In Surface, we expect low double-digit growth, with continued momentum across our commercial and consumer segments. In Search ex-Tac, we expect revenue growth similar to Q3. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline year over year, driven by the tough comparable in Xbox software and services and the continuation of the hardware trends from Q3. Now, back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion and operating expenses of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. Other Income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 17%, with some potential volatility given it is the final quarter of our fiscal year. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some closing thoughts as we look forward to FY20. Overall, we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made thus far in FY19. Our decision to invest with significant ambition in high growth areas coupled with strong execution has resulted in material revenue growth at scale and a stronger position in many key markets.  As FY20 approaches, we again see tremendous opportunity to drive sustained long-term growth. We will invest aggressively in strategic areas like Cloud through AI and GitHub, Business Applications through Power Platform and LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security, and Surface as well as Gaming.  At the same time, we will continue to drive improvement and efficiency as our business scales. This consistent approach of investing in future growth while delivering strong operating performance will result in double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY20 with stable operating margins. With that, Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer : Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nHeather Bellini: Amy, if I go back and look through your KPIs, it looks like the year-over-year growth in commercial bookings has never been this high on a constant currency basis, at least I was able to go back through fiscal '13. You mentioned an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts which obviously is a driver of this. But is there any more color you could share? Is this coming from a handful of customers? I mean if that are just driving all of their like outsourcing everything to you guys and shutting down their data centers? Or do you see this as kind of a broad based trend, even in some of the industries that have been slow to move to the cloud where this is really starting to snowball?  And then the follow up would be just Azure gross margins where you guys have done a remarkable job just continuing to increase efficiency there. How much room is left to go and how do you think about the percentage of COGS in Azure that are variable versus fixed and has the ratio been changing? \nAmy Hood: Great, Heather. Let me try to take both of those questions. On your commercial bookings growth question, I find it easier to think about commercial bookings before I answer the larger question about one-time in two ways. The first is the expiration base absolutely does matter and that's how we talked about it, and we had a actually very good quarter here in terms of renewals and what I think of as revenue we capture. We\u2019re able to grow the revenue in existing contracts, and so that absolutely contributed and has contributed over the past couple of years to what I do believe has been reasonably consistent, commercial bookings strength versus the expiration base.  The second component is what I would put in a bucket of new business. Whether that new business comes as what you saw this quarter are two ways. There was some on-prem strength this quarter, it does show-up in bookings, it doesn\u2019t show up in unearned and it does show up in the P&L, we had a good quarter there. And we did have some large Azure contracts which tend to be longer dated and tend to have low billings upfront. That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way, and so you will see as we go forward and you are already starting to see it more volatility in this number, not just based on the way we\u2019ve traditionally talked about it which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger and longer term commitments by what we now think of not just as customers but these are really now partnership relationships that we have where to your point we're co-collaborating to help customers be successful as they build their digital future. And so you will see a little bit of volatility in this number as those contracts and the type of contracts start to land.  On your second question of Azure GM we have continued to see strong improvement in the core gross margin as Azure team has done a nice job on a number of fronts, continue to make progress on both software innovation but also importantly hardware innovation and working with our supply-chain to continue to have and see benefits on that side, and also is increasing use of premium services also contributed to Azure gross margin improvement.  So while we remain focused on efficiency and the utilization of the hardware and software is also important to continue to see premium upsell, premium workload usage, so the customers are getting the most out of their deployments and usage of the Azure platform.  In general it hasn\u2019t changed a ton in terms of that final component about fixed versus I think variable base, it's still been in the I think low [40%] [ph] as a range for us in terms of what depreciation versus what's more variable.\nOperator: Our first next comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nKeith Weiss: A very impressive quarter. I'm going to speak a similar question to Heather\u2019s but [indiscernible] try to get a higher level answer. In terms of -- during this quarter, it just sounds to me like I heard Amy talk more about exceeding expectations than we have in prior quarters and exceeding plan more than we have in prior quarters. This matches up from what we are hearing in CIO surveys and talking to customers, it sounds like there is an inflection point going on in adoption of cloud and digitalization effort. So the question to you is, are you seeing that, are you starting to see an inflection point in terms of these adoption trends and the investment that you guys have made behind this really starting to take hold? And then perhaps a follow up for Amy. So operating margins really exceeded our expectations this quarter and I think consistent with expectations, can you talk a little bit about kind of what drove that and kind of why we wouldn\u2019t see as much as that on a go forward basis in terms of operating margin expansion?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, thanks Keith for the question. So let me start. I think overall, what we're seeing is continued momentum, if you think about even our overall approach has been to have a view of an architecture that is grounded in our customers\u2019 needs. So we always believe that in distributed computing, you need a cloud and an edge. You need hybrid and guess what, today in 2019, hybrid has become much more main stream. But we were talking about this even five years ago. They also sort of said things that will matter in this transition to the cloud will be consistency and productivity. So for example, whether it's developer productivity or IT productivity, it\u2019s not any one dimension, you need to bring IT and developers together to drive agility in an organization and their digital capability building. This is again, a place where we've had traditional strength. And that's showing up in the marketplace.  And also if you look at our cloud stack, we have application and infrastructure, data and AI, productivity and collaboration, as well as business applications. That's pretty unique again. So that's, I think, what is showing up at scale as competitive differentiation and that's what you see in our numbers. But the most importantly, I think you see it in the customer momentum and what I believe is what is customer success. Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation. It is about the rest of the world doing innovation with technology and Microsoft is uniquely in position to enable that. \nAmy Hood: And on your operating margin question Keith, there's a couple of things I would say that. In this quarter in particular, the places where we had a lot of outperformance were especially high margin areas, and I would point out three. The first is obviously the OEM and chip supply. The improvement in that in Q3 is obviously very high margin and also the bottom.  Japan as a geography for us is a high transactional market. And so when Japan is strong, it tends to be a very high margin landing down to the bottom line. And the other one is the on-premises server number which is very good in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also with high margin. So when that happens, you do see because it's a lot of -- almost 100% in quarter recognition, a lot of help at the operating margin line.  Now, the more sustainable conversation I think we continue to have on operating margin is our ability to pick the right secular markets in the right secular trends, you see significant revenue growth. We continue to focus on improving the gross margin of each individual product area, which creates leverage over time. And finally, focused investment and operating expense and that obviously creates leverage. And I think you do see that in general through the year as we continue to keep that formula.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with the question. \nMark Moerdler: Congratulations on a really strong quarter everyone. Amy, Satya -- Amy, can you delve into the impact of Azure hybrid benefits on Azure revenues, serving tools, renewals, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really well understood. Is it having more meaningful impact on Azure's reported revenue growth because of the fact that some of this is apparent in serving tools? And Satya can you give us some added color on why this specific offering is resonating so well with customers, which is what we're hearing? \nSatya Nadella: Yes, maybe I can start on the second part and then leads to the first question. I would say Mark the main thing that this offering enables is the flexibility with which customers can adopt hybrid computing. And as I've always said that there is -- hybrid computing is important for workloads that are more in the characteristic -- can be characterized as lift, shift and modernize, so that's one motion. And then there is a new load hybrid as well which is people are building in fact they're doing AI training job in the cloud but want to deploy the model close to the edge. And in both of the cases, hybrid benefits actually help with -- our business model is basically differentiated in supporting the architectural need and the flexibility needs. The one additional thing I\u2019d mention, which is increasingly becoming clearer to us is operational sovereignty will become important, the world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some margin as set of requirements but it's going to be very heterogeneous, very in many cases regulated and so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model I think shows up with the maximum flexibility. \nAmy Hood: And then let me talk a little bit about the question from server products and services and how to think about the hybrid use benefits. In general today Mark almost all of that benefit shows up in what I would say as the on-premise KPI, and so over time though how you should think about that it will eventually show up in Azure consumed revenue growth, this is a benefit that\u2019s fundamentally about high value and flexibility and meeting customers where they are so that they can make a determination of when to make that choice. And so it tends to be like it's focusing people back on the all up KPI because it's a best representation of where customer commitment and usage of our architected from the beginning hybrid cloud. But to your specific questions it shows up today in the on-prem number is where you can see most of the strength of that value and over time as it gets used and consumed it will show lot more in the Azure ACR number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. \nQ: Amy, I'd like to ask you about the big revenue beat in the Intelligent Cloud segment that drove much of the upside and in particular the server product KPI that was just addressed up 9%. I'm just wondering if you could frame how material the contribution of the Version 2008 upgrades were? And assuming that that lift can continue throughout calendar 2019, could it be enough to keep that the on-prem KPI you described it flat or even up slightly in the coming two quarters despite the tougher comps? \narl Keirstead : Amy, I'd like to ask you about the big revenue beat in the Intelligent Cloud segment that drove much of the upside and in particular the server product KPI that was just addressed up 9%. I'm just wondering if you could frame how material the contribution of the Version 2008 upgrades were? And assuming that that lift can continue throughout calendar 2019, could it be enough to keep that the on-prem KPI you described it flat or even up slightly in the coming two quarters despite the tougher comps? \nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. When I think about the on-prem number I really divide it into things that have durable value and things I think of as more one-time. When I think about the durable trends that I expect to see it's been the hybrid value prop that we really just talked about on Mark\u2019s last question. And then the premium mix. Those two we have seen and continue to see. I do think we saw some benefit of end of support, but I would not say it was the primary benefit this quarter. The primary benefit was the two things I just talked about. End of support obviously we've got SQL in July and then Windows in January. And so I do think we saw some impact, particularly in SQL and I do expect to see some of that in Q4. But the Q4 comparable for on-prem is very big. And so even with some of that benefit of the durable trends, plus I think a more temporal one of end of support, I do expect to see a deceleration in that number in Q4. \nOperator: Our next question comes from like of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nJennifer Lowe: Great, thank you. I wanted to turn to the Office 365 Commercial business a bit. And that's been consistent very strong performer for you on and was again this quarter. But maybe just two related questions there. First, if I heard you, right, Satya I think you said there was 180 million users now on Office 365 Commercial which seems like you're hitting a lot of the customers that you thought might be there a couple of years ago. So I was just curious to get your view on how far along you are in that adoption cycle. And if there's still a lot more opportunity in terms of see expansion in the upcoming year? And then related, Amy you mentioned E3 and E5 are both pretty big contributors on the ASP front in the quarter. Are we kind of seeing shifting where E5 is sort of increasing in relevance in E3\u2019s played out a bit or is it sort of equally balancing, just curious to get sort of the mixing there as well? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Sure. In terms of overall reach of Office 365, we continue to see significant opportunity going forward on multiple dimensions. So for example, we never participated as much in I'd call it non-developed markets, medium and small businesses with all of the sophisticated workloads. So, now that with a SaaS approach, you can reach a much broader base of business customers all over the world, is one opportunity.  The second opportunity is, if you look at Teams, as an example, we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers. So this is whether it's in healthcare, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, just not knowledge workers, but where you now have messaging solutions, as well as business process workflows integrated. So it's that combination of things going from knowledge workers to first-line going and the ability to reach all sizes of businesses is what's going to continue to help us I think have overall seat growth or socket growth. And then of course, there is the other dimension, which is the levels of Office 365 all the way to E5 with significant value.  And the one thing I\u2019d mention is the having compliance security that spans all of these tools, is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage in a customer value proposition because I think, our customers look to use more SaaS applications, they don't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden. And so therefore, Office 365\u2019s approach resonates even there. \nAmy Hood: And Jen maybe a little to your question, which is fundamentally about seat growth and ARPU as the drivers of that all up Office 365 Commercial growth number. This quarter and a little bit last I actually think some of the ARPU increase has been masked by some of the trends in seat growth. What I mean that is that 27% seat growth is starting to include some lower ARPU seats that Satya just mentioned whether that's in academic, in edu, in front-line workers and that's really important for us to keep having that seat growth even if it\u2019s not at the same ARPU level those are not seats that we ever could reach before at any level and that's absolutely new opportunity for us. But it does tend to mask a little some of the ARPU improvement that we've seen, it's still E3 and E5, there\u2019s opportunity on both, although we are starting to see the impact of E5 in net ARPU number. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. \nMark Murphy: Satya, we've seen many indications of Azure winning a greater share of enterprise workloads recently. Do you think that you have found the right formula now for Azure to win the majority of workloads in the enterprise IT world? And then Amy just given the trajectory and the long-term commitments that you mentioned there, do you see it pass for Azure to surpass Office 365 Commercial and thus become the largest revenue stream for Microsoft I would say in the next couple of few years?\nSatya Nadella: Sure, I'll start Mark and having grown up essentially in our infrastructure business at Microsoft, I would say that compared to even the previous eras where we did well in the client server era, in face of tough competition and in this era again in the face of a different set of competitors, we are doing well and we are doing well much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these tier 1 workloads which we never saw in the past. If you think about it in the client server era we never participated in the core of the digital infrastructure or financial services or in healthcare or in retail or in manufacturing and absolutely when we think about the digital transformational and design wins, deployment, consumption, it's kind of like what we would have done with some ISVs of the past, how we worked perhaps with SAP in the 90s when we were coming out with SQL server and they were coming out with R3 is what we are now doing with many, many, many businesses as they build out their digital businesses. So that' sort of perhaps characterizes for you what's new in terms of Microsoft\u2019s own growth in this space. \nAmy Hood: And the way that would show up Mark is a little bit I think where you were leading with the question you asked which is when we think about the Microsoft commercial cloud at $9.6 billion and growing over 40% how do you see that evolving and really the question is we have quite a bit of per seat or per user type businesses but what Satya just talked about is really about the Azure concept or participating both in an expand scenario total addressable market which I think people have talked about for a long time but what was different about what Satya just said is our ability to frankly to have higher share in the next era than we had in the last era. And so if you look at then our ability to grow in the Azure would be larger or over any period of time then ARPU seat or per user businesses it certainly could be but I don\u2019t want that to really diminish the fact that there is a lot of room for us and our per seat businesses particularly across LinkedIn, the Power platform work we're doing. Satya mentioned security, identity, compliance, there is a lot of room for us to continue to add value and growth in that area as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from like of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss MacMillan: Thanks so much and my congratulations as well. We continue to see this really nice progression in the commercial cloud gross margin and you called out the Azure gross margin improvements. And within that there's some moving pieces. I think you\u2019ve got better utilization and efficiency of core Azure. You've got premium services, and then you've got this counter prevailing force of the different growth in consumption versus user base.  Two questions on this, one for Satya. On the premium services, I'm just curious as to, which one or two or three are you seeing maybe break out become the largest or grow the fastest, which are most meaningful at this point?  And then secondly for Amy, as we think about this trend, are you convinced that we'll continue to see not just for fiscal Q4, but into fiscal \u201820 and beyond consistent progression and growth in the overall commercial cloud gross margin? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Sure. I mean, on the first question Ross as far as our premium services, just even on the application infrastructure side, for example, in compute, there is increasing need for things like IoT services. Essentially, there is a new business application like set of services that are getting developed to help people manage their complex IoT application development. IoT Central is a good example of that when you have many, many connected devices, you need a control plane for many of those devices, so that you contain the complexity of your app deployment, security management. That's one example. The other one is of course data. And the sophistication of the data aid is growing exponentially, both in terms of the needs of the databases required, the processing that is required close to data. So that's another place where something like Cosmos DB which is very unique in capability in the marketplace is definitely another service that's got real traction. Even data warehousing, the scale at which this is another market which we never participated in, in the past, whereas now we are one of the most competitive products when it comes to benchmarking around data warehousing. So those are all things that I would say are premium services that just talking about new applications being built on Azure, not counting all of the SaaS applications about that. \nAmy Hood: And to your overall commercial progress margin question. You're right, the fundamental driver is when I look forward into next year, I expect each service just like it did this year to really see gross margin improvement, whether that service is LinkedIn or Dynamics or Office 365, Azure per user or Azure IaaS in PaaS, but what you'll see is a revenue mix shift, right, that will offset that to Azure IaaS and PaaS. And so what that generally will do, will be a headwind to continued gross amount of the improvement even though you'll see individual improvement across all the GM services, and you'll continue to see Azure increase as a percentage of the total revenue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with the question. \nBrad Zelnick: I want to follow-up on Karl's question but more generally on database products with the end of support coming for SQL Server [2008] in July, Satya, can you tell us how that sparking conversations with customers about database offerings on Azure and moving workloads to the cloud. And Amy help can you perhaps help us contextualize the opportunity to move traditional database workloads onto Azure and what the expansion economics look like?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, a couple things Brad. One is, overall the need to get on the latest and greatest database technology just because of what is the increasing need for compute and data at the edge is what's driving a lot of the conversations on SQL Server. Interesting enough, we have a lot of requirements around edge devices even, so that you can have databases with compute so that you can really have what is needed at the edge, that\u2019s sort of one conversation. The other one is in terms of the cloud migration there is a variety of different used cases, we see people are using SQL DB, which is essentially PaaS service but it's a complete compatibility of SQL Server, they want to managed services around SQL Server which we have. And so both of those are all happening in parallel. A good example of this is in fact even the rewrite of complete revamp I would say of Dynamics. Dynamics 365 and its architecture at least in my eyes is a thing of beauty because it's completely been rewritten for the new database technology, whether it is on the data base side or on the data warehouse side, again uses a whole bunch of micro services and functions so that you can do AI close to data. That type of architectural approach is what we see is possible now for every SaaS application vendor out there as well. Because you think about the number of SaaS -- the number of business applications that were built on SQL Server I feel that that's an architecture that can support both what they want to do on the edge, but as well as on the cloud. \nAmy Hood: And on the contextualizing opportunity, the reason I said it's not the primary driver is because of that vast, vast majority of our server business is annuity based. And so when it's annuity based there is really no opportunity to see it as upside in Q4 from an end of support frame. For the smaller portion of our business it\u2019s still non-annuity per transactional, it does provide as I talked about earlier some opportunity but it\u2019s not that large just because the nature of the commitment our customers now is far more of the annuity type. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nRaimo Lenschow : Can you talk on the Windows OEM side? You mentioned that the chipset situation is kind of easing a little bit. Are we kind of fully done there in terms of what do you see there from the Intel side and does that create some pent-up demand for the coming quarters as people are thinking about moving over to Windows 10 with the end of life coming up?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Raimo. I think we actually in Q3 as I said met sort of the unfulfilled Q2 demand and Q3, so I don't think of it as a pent up situation heading into Q4 and our guide certainly does not indicate that, that is what we believe will happen. And what I would say is I think there we feel good about the supply in the Commercial segment and the Premium Consumer segment, which is where the vast majority of our revenue is in OEM. And so I think in those segments, we feel fine for Q4.\nMichael Spencer: That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you. \nSatya Nadella: Thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining on the phone. We delivered $32.5 billion in revenue this quarter with double-digit top line and bottom line growth driven by strength across all of our commercial cloud. Our commercial cloud revenue grew 48%, anchored by Azure revenue growth of 76%. These results speak to us picking the right secular trends in large and growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy, as well as focused innovation and execution. Leading companies in every industry are partnering with us to build their own digital capability to compete and grow. This is creating a broad opportunity for everyone, including our ecosystem. As one example, the co-sell program we introduced 18 months ago has already generated $8 billion in contracted partner revenue. Now I'll briefly highlight our momentum and innovation across our businesses. Microsoft 365 empowers everyone, enterprises, small businesses and then more than 2 billion first-line workers with an integrated secure experience that transcends any one device. We are helping every business build out their system of communication and collaboration to drive their productivity as well as their business transformation. Microsoft Teams is the hub for teamwork and a powerful on-ramp for Microsoft 365, and we're seeing increased usage of OneDrive, SharePoint, Yammer and the entire Office Suite of applications. Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, meetings, video conferencing as well as document collaboration. And as of this quarter, enhanced voice capabilities like group call forwarding, delegation, location-based routing are all being brought into Teams. We are seeing rapid adoption of Teams with more than 420,000 organizations of all sizes and 89 of the Fortune 100 using Teams, including customers like Pfizer, who chose Teams as the collaboration platform for their 115,000 employees, and we are expanding into new and underpenetrated markets. This quarter, we introduced new capabilities to empower first-line workers in the service and task-oriented roles to communicate and collaborate more effectively on the go with mobile schedule management, location sharing as well as the ability to easily record and share secure audio messages. We're expanding our opportunity in education with Microsoft 365, innovating in hardware and software to improve learning outcomes from the more collaborative classrooms with Teams to personalized learning tools in OneNote, to social learning with Flipgrid, to affordable easy-to-manage Windows 10 devices. Cybersecurity is a central challenge, and Microsoft is leading the way, helping all organizations operate in what is known in the industry as a zero trust environment. It all starts with Azure AD Active Directory and the deep work we're doing with Microsoft Threat Protection to provide an integrated solution for our customers that extends across identities, device endpoints, e-mail, information, cloud applications and infrastructure. And this quarter, we introduced new advanced capabilities for identity and threat protection and for information protection and compliance. A comprehensive approach to security and compliance is another reason why customers are adopting Microsoft 365. Customers from Neiman Marcus to Brooks Running to global biopharmaceutical leader, Sanofi, all chose our solutions. Surface had its biggest quarter ever this holiday, delivering strong double-digit growth in both consumer and commercial. We continue to innovate and expand our family of devices, setting the bar for the industry with newest Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and Surface Go. More broadly, Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. And at CES, our OEM partners showcased always connected Windows 10 PCs that deliver break-through levels of performance to enable powerful new scenarios like immersive gaming. Moving to business applications and LinkedIn. Dynamics 365 grew 51% this quarter as we win customers with our differentiated approach to systems of record and systems of engagement by making them more modular, extensible and AI-driven. Increasingly, business process automation includes digitizing physical spaces, activities and interactions. Dynamics 365, along with advances in Azure IoT, AI and Mixed Reality are leading the way for organizations to create these new systems of observation and systems of intelligence that drive end-to-end business processes and bridge the online and off-line worlds. For example, we now have the capability for customers to manage inventory in real-time from the shelf to the warehouse to the farm. But we're not stopping there. Our Power platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps and Flow enables anyone in an organization to start building an intelligent app or workflow where none exists. It is the only solution of its kind in the industry, bringing together no code or low code app development, robotic process automation and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive application platform. And it enables extensibility across Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 as well as leading third-party SaaS business applications. With Power platform, Microsoft is fundamentally demarketizing business processes, empowering everyone to make smarter, faster decisions, and I'm energized about the tremendous opportunity in this space. Already, Centrica is relying on Power BI, Power Apps and Flow along with Dynamics 365 to transform scheduling and dispatch of its first-line workforce in the United Kingdom. Virgin Group is using Power Apps and Dynamics 365 to generate a single view of its passengers' surfacing insights to improve customer service and increase operational efficiency. And in Italy, postal service is using Dynamics 365 to jump start the digital transformation of thousands of the post offices across the country. Moving to LinkedIn. We continue to generate strong revenue growth across all businesses, with sessions growth of 30% year-over-year fueled by record levels of engagement in the feed and content shared across the platform. We also saw record job postings again this quarter. We introduced new brand and community building tools for marketeers with LinkedIn pages, making it easier for organizations of all sizes to foster strong connections with LinkedIn's 610 million members. Finally, Glint broadens our market opportunity with its industry leading employee engagement platform. At a time when competing for talent and skill development is a priority for every leader, the combination of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, LinkedIn Learning and now Glint helps every business attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs marketplace. Now turning to Azure. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud with a consistent computing stack that extends from the data center to the edge, and customers across every industry recognize this architectural advantage. In retail, Azure was front and center at the NRF. Kroger is partnering with us to redefine customer experience in stalls and provide employees with AI-driven insights, while the Gap chose our cloud to accelerate the digital transformation. And just this week, Albertsons chose Azure as its preferred cloud. In financial services, MasterCard is partnering with us on a new, more secure way to verify digital identities. BlackRock is applying the power of the Microsoft Cloud to reimagine retirement planning, and UBS is using Azure to increase agility across the organization while meeting the highest bar of compliance and security. In health care, Walgreens Boots Alliance chose Azure to put people at the center of their health and wellness with digital solutions to improve health care outcomes and lower costs. In addition, they will roll out Microsoft 365 to more than 380,000 employees in stores globally. We're accelerating our innovation in emerging workloads like IoT and edge AI. At CES, our partners showcased how Azure IoT and Azure AI are enabling them to build new connected devices and experiences that span the cloud and the edge from connected homes to cars to smart cities. Just this month, Starbucks chose Azure Sphere to secure its business-critical edge devices in the stores. Developers will increasingly drive the influence business -- and influence business processes and functions across every organization. And we are committed to drive at giving developers the tools they need to be productive on any platform. More than 12 million developers around the world use Visual Studio to build applications, and new features enable them to collaborate in real-time and spend more time driving innovation. We closed our acquisition of GitHub this quarter, enabling us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos. GitHub has more than 31 million developer accounts and recently surpassed 100 million code repositories, a major milestone. Development teams at more than half of the Fortune 50 do their work in GitHub Enterprise. This month, we announced significant updates to make GitHub accessible to even more developers, introducing unlimited private repos as well as new, simpler and unified enterprise offering already available through the Microsoft global sales force, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, we announced our acquisition of Citus Data, the leading provider of PostgreSQL, enhancing our overall data platform differentiation and building on our investments in Azure and making it the most comprehensive cloud for open source and proprietary workloads at any scale. And now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity to transform how games are distributed, played and viewed. Our investments in content community and cloud services across every endpoint drove both record user engagement and record average revenue per user and contributed to our largest gaming revenue quarter ever, driven by software and services. We acquired two new studios this quarter, bringing the total to 13 and more than doubling our first-party content capacity in the past 6 months. Xbox Live monthly active users reached a record 64 million, with the highest number of mobile and PC users to date. Xbox Game Pass subscribers and Mixer engagement also hit new all-time highs. And Minecraft, which continues to be one of the most popular and durable gaming franchises in the industry, delivered record revenue as we expanded into new platforms, geographies and segments like education. PlayFab surpassed 1 billion player accounts this quarter, and xCloud will be public trialed later this year as we make progress on our ambition to build a world-class gaming platform spanning mobile, PC and console. In closing, our accelerating customer momentum is driven by our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies and differentiated innovation across our portfolio. Every company is becoming a digital company, and they're looking for a trusted partner to help them build tech intensity. Microsoft is that partner. With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as a reminder, my comments across our results and outlook include the impact from GitHub, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses. This quarter, revenue was $32.5 billion, up 12% and 13% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 12%. Operating income increased 18%, and earnings per share was $1.10, increasing 15% and 14% in constant currency when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA. Strong execution and continued customer demand for our hybrid cloud offerings drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. We continued to benefit from favorable secular trends and IT spending conditions. From a geographic perspective, our performance was in line with macroeconomic trends with strength across the U.S., Western Europe and the U.K. partially offset by weaker performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. In our commercial business, annuity mix grew 3 points year-over-year to 89%. Commercial unearned revenue was $25.3 billion, growing 20%, slightly above our expectations. And commercial bookings were strong, growing 18% and 22% in constant currency driven by solid renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger, longer-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, strong performance in larger long-term Azure contracts, Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts will drive bookings growth and in-period revenue but will have a limited impact on unearned revenue. Commercial cloud revenue was $9 billion, growing 48% and 47% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 62% driven by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Our company gross margin percentage was 62%, flat year-over-year as improving cloud margins were offset by sales mix shift to commercial cloud and Surface hardware. The U.S. dollar was a bit stronger than anticipated, which resulted in a slightly greater impact to our results. FX reduced revenue, COGS and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. Operating expenses grew 7%, slightly lower than expectation as some marketing spend shifted to Q3. We again expanded operating margins as a result of focused investment, solid execution and improving gross margins in key product areas. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $10.1 billion, increasing 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365. Office Commercial revenue grew 11%. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 34% and 33% in constant currency driven by seat growth of 27% and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value E3 and E5 offerings. We saw installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments. Office Consumer revenue grew 1% and 2% in constant currency, below our expectation. As discussed on our last earnings call, Q2 revenue growth was impacted by channel inventories normalizing after the prelaunch builds in Q1 but was further negatively impacted by a smaller-than-expected consumer PC market and execution challenges through the quarter. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 33.3 million, a sequential slowdown primarily due to changes made in how Office 365 is sold in Japan. Our Dynamics business grew 17% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 51% and 50% in constant currency. This quarter, more than 9 out of every 10 new Dynamics CRM customers chose our cloud offering. LinkedIn revenue increased 29% and 30% in constant currency with continued strong execution across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions grew 30% as engagement once again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as increased cloud mix offset the benefit from improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins. Operating expenses increased 3% and 4% in constant currency as we continued to invest in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which now includes GitHub. Revenue was $9.4 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our hybrid solutions. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 24%. Azure revenue increased 76% with strong growth from both the consumption and per user base businesses. In our on-premises server business, continued customer demand for flexible hybrid solutions and our premium offerings drove growth of 3% and 4% in constant currency. Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as revenue mix to Azure IaaS and PaaS was offset by material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. Operating expenses increased 26% with continued investment in cloud and AI engineering as well as commercial sales capacity and the addition of GitHub. Operating income grew 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now to the results for More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 7%. Results in our Windows OEM business were lower than expected, partially offset by strong Surface results. In Windows, the overall PC market was smaller than we expected primarily due to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners, which constrained an otherwise healthy PC ecosystem and negatively impacted both OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue growth. Windows OEM Pro revenue declined 2%, roughly in line with the commercial PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 11%, below the market with continued pressure in the entry-level category. Inventory levels ended the quarter below the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 14% in constant currency with continued customer adoption of our premium offerings. Windows 10 deployments across new and existing devices remained strong. Gaming revenue grew 8% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox software and services revenue increased 31% and 32% in constant currency, primarily driven by continued strength from a third-party title. Additionally, strong subscriber growth across Xbox Live and Game Pass helped to offset lower-than-expected performance from other third-party titles on the platform. Xbox hardware performed better than expected but declined year-over-year given the holiday launch of the Xbox One X a year ago. In Surface, revenue increased 39% and 41% in constant currency to nearly $1.9 billion, ahead of our expectations, driven by strong growth across both our consumer and commercial segments. Search revenue ex TAC increased 14%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. Segment gross margin dollars increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin Surface and gaming businesses. Operating expenses declined 4%. As a result, operating income increased 18% and 19% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were down sequentially to $3.9 billion, lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter-to-quarter variability and the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for plant, property and equipment was $3.7 billion. Cash flow from operations increased 13% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of higher cash payments for plant, property and equipment. Other income was $127 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income and investment gains partially offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was slightly above 17%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $9.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 91%. Our Q2 share repurchase was $6.1 billion, higher than our normal quarterly pace and aligned to our commitment of incremental buyback to fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year. Now let's move to the outlook. For Q3, first, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and assuming the current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to decrease revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points and decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point. With the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth and Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Second, continued strong customer demand, healthy bookings growth and increasing revenue annuity mix should drive another solid quarter in our Commercial business. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to decline approximately 2% to 3%, in line sequentially with historic trends. We expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to continue to improve year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin will again be partially offset by the mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Third, CapEx. We expect a sequential dollar increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest to support increasing demand. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.9 billion and $10.1 billion, driven by double-digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics as well as healthy LinkedIn growth on a strong prior year comparable. We expect Office Consumer revenue growth to continue to be in the low single digits as growth in Office 365 will be partially offset by the continuation of the consumer PC market headwinds. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion, with our hybrid demand continuing to drive strong growth in server products and cloud services. Azure growth will continue to reflect the balance between strong growth in our consumption-based businesses and moderating growth in our per-user business. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.35 billion and $10.65 billion, with a shift in revenue mix to our Surface and gaming businesses. In Windows overall, OEM revenue growth should be in the low single digits as we anticipate continued market demand -- market impact from constrained chip supply in Q3. In Surface, continued momentum from Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Go will drive another strong quarter of over 20% growth for Surface. In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q2. In gaming, we expect revenue growth to be slightly higher than last quarter. Sales mix will shift to software and services where we expect healthy growth. Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.35 billion to $10.55 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion dollars, inclusive of marketing spend that moved from Q2 to Q3. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest expense. And finally, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with the full year rate of 17%. Now a few comments on our outlook for Q4 and the full fiscal year, which are unchanged from October. First on FX. In Q4, assuming rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Second, in Q4, we expect continued strong performance in our commercial cloud business; but as a reminder, we also have several challenging comparisons from the prior year, specifically in on-premise server, LinkedIn, Windows OEM and the strength of a third-party title in gaming. In terms of operating expenses, we continue to expect full year growth of roughly 8%. We will continue to invest in strategic growth areas like Azure, GitHub, Dynamics, the Power platform, LinkedIn, Teams and gaming content given our significant growth opportunities, competitive advantage and growing momentum. We still expect full year operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year, inclusive of the full GAAP impact of GitHub. For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate, even as we meet the high demand for our cloud services. We remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace that will fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we still expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Nice quarter. A question on Azure, and it's a two-parter, one part for Satya and one for Amy. Satya, there's been a lot of press releases of you up on the stage with CEOs from guys like Albertson and Walgreens talking about these large strategic deals that you're doing with these companies. Can you help us understand sort of how do these large strategic deals translate into sort of the services being used on Azure changing? Like is there a mix shift in the type of services that are supporting these large digital transformations that we should be sort of aware of on a going-forward basis? And to Amy, one of the sort of big investor debates is a lot of suppliers into -- on the big cloud vendors like yourself are talking about weaker shipments into the suppliers. But you guys have seen very stable growth. I mean, Azure growth was dead solid from Q1 to Q2. Can you help us understand how the sort of capital intensity of some of these cloud businesses has been changing over time?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. First of all, thank you, Keith, for the question. It is very true that, at this point, we have seen these very large digital transformational efforts and projects that we are partnered with. And they span, quite frankly, all the industries. I think in the last quarter, you saw in health care, in retail, in financial services. In fact, I sort of internally think of them as what our relationships with our traditional OEM partners in the PC ecosystem were. At this point, some of the partnerships we have with customers are of that same magnitude. And that just speaks to, I think, what's happening in the economy, which is every company is becoming a digital company, and essentially what used to be COGS and operating expense is all going digital. From a mix of services, it starts always with, I would say, infrastructure, so this is the edge and the cloud, the infrastructure being used as compute. In fact, you could say the measure of a company going digital is the amount of compute they use. So that's the base.  Then on top of that, of course, all this compute means it's being used with data. So the data estate, one of the largest things that happens is people consolidate the data that they have and so that they can reason over it. And that's where things like AI services all get used. So we definitely see that path of -- where they're adopting the layers of Azure. But it doesn't stop in Azure. In fact, if you take Walgreens Boots Alliance, it was Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. In many cases, it's Dynamics 365. Any IoT project on Azure leads to a Dynamics field service project in most instances. So we're seeing the breadth and depth of our cloud offering, which is what we are really architected to have real synergies in the context of what our customers want to achieve, and that's what we are seeing. And one comment before I throw it over to Amy. Even on that -- our own demand for it, we don't see any change. In fact, it's very healthy and we think that it'll continue to be healthy. And if anything, at our scale, as you can imagine, we are becoming much more efficient in how we use software to utilize the capacity we have. So we have significant gains in utilization across our estate. So with that, I'll turn over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: And Keith, the thing I would add in addition to Satya's comment about investing and investing materially to make these improvements in performance and utilization, we've always had and seen, as you all have gotten a bit used to, it can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and so we expect a sequential growth into Q3, which is really just a movement that happens from time to time. Our guidance, really, in terms of overall capital spend is unchanged from 90 days ago even if the timing of that can move month-to-month.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.\nKarl Keirstead: Amy, I just wanted to ask you a question about your March quarter guidance. The total looks terrific. The only area that might decelerate a little bit appears to be the Intelligent Cloud segment, where 17%, I think at the midpoint, it implies still amazing but down from 20-plus percent the last 3 quarters. So I'm wondering if you could just focus on that for a second and help us understand what some of the variables inside that Intelligent Cloud business are that might be impacting next quarter growth.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. The first place to start is obviously FX. We've got a 2 point headwind on that range of 16% to 18%, so if you think about that and move your midpoint up to 19%. And then I think within that guidance, there's a reasonable amount of confidence that the server products and services KPI will remain quite healthy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: I have a question for Satya and then one for Amy if you don't mind. Satya, in the different documents related to the earnings this quarter you have on product launches, et cetera, there's a discussion in there on the Microsoft launch of the Quantum Development Kit. Can you give us a bit of color on how you're thinking about quantum computing today, where the -- how soon the opportunity, where is it in the maturation? And then I have a follow-up for Amy.\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Thanks, Mark. So the way we think about our overall investment, I think of this as a systems investment because at the scale at which we operate, the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge infrastructure, which you all track as Azure, you got to remember it's the core platform that's powering everything from our gaming ambitions to what we are doing with Microsoft 365, to what we are doing with Dynamics 365 and of course, our third-party business in Azure. So that's the core platform. And now when you think about the scale at which we operate, it is very important for us to make sure that every new breakthrough that happens in the system architecture that can improve efficiencies in what is distributed computing is something that we stay on the forefront of it. So that's why we have a very long-term view on Quantum, and the things that we did even in this last quarter is take things like the quantum simulator stuff and bring it to Azure. In fact, we are seeing very good adoption in scientific labs, in universities and some pharma companies and others who are looking at really building their quantum algorithmic promise long before the quantum computer cloud is real so that they are ready to be able to take advantage of that computing resource. So that's how we look at it, but you got to remember that before Quantum, there are many byproducts of a quantum effort that have significant implications on how we get more competitive, efficient in terms of providing computing to the world. So that's one of the reasons why you hear us talk about quantum as the long-term goal, but you can fully expect us to take a lot of learnings, advances in that roadmap and bring them to market earlier.\nMark Moerdler: I really appreciate it. Amy, you gave a lot of color this quarter, but in the quarter, there was overall transactional weakness. Can you give us a little more color? Is there something structural driving it, U.S. government, China weakness? Were there just simply less contracts up for renewal? Or is it the cloud? Any additional data would be helpful.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Mark, for the question. The only transactional weakness I felt in the quarter at all was what we covered, which was the OEM impact from the chip supply, which was about 1.5 points of growth on MPC, and the Office Consumer impact, which was secondary impact of the PC environment plus some execution challenges we had that I feel really good that we've gotten to the root of and will get handled in H2. Outside of that, our transactional execution was really precisely as we expected. Office Commercial actually had a pretty reasonable quarter given some of the impacts we had in Q1, a couple of points of impact of extra growth that we talked about. And the product and services KPI on prem and server was also quite good when we think about the balance and what that represents for hybrid demand. We continue to see good demand on DC -- sorry, data center modernization as well as some of the premium SKUs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhilip Winslow: Congrats on the great quarter. Just wanted to focus on Windows. Amy, I think you've guided to low single-digit growth in Windows OEM revenue for Q3. And just wondering if you can sort of help us bridge that because you also talked about inventory levels, Windows being low in the OEMs as well as some mix. So maybe kind of help us bridge the gap between your comments about maybe continued storage as a component but -- the revenue growth. And then the other side of Windows, the Commercial, obviously it's been super strong, but we're starting to lap some -- there's some pretty big growth numbers Q3, Q4 last year, and then, obviously, there's some accounting change with 606. Maybe give us some color there. So I guess, one, on the OEM side and then, two, on the commercial side.\nAmy Hood: Great. Thank you. On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well. So think about there having -- because your -- we do expect chip supply to remain constrained. I don't expect to see any impact from changing inventory levels through the next quarter. So I would sort of remove that as one of the mechanisms you're thinking about on overall OEM demand. I do think what we will see in Q3 is we're expecting a little better performance in the Pro side of the market in terms of seeing growth there, and that's probably helping a little bit. To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables. But a lot of that comparability, which you referenced, is due a little bit of how it's licensed, which is a lot of this is new and gets recognized more upfront in quarter. That's going to continue to have some lumpiness still as we go over the years. As that business continues to grow, it'll get less of that impact. The primary driver in terms of billings is how I tend to think about that, has been pretty consistent. It's been double-digit consistent growth. It tends to look a lot like our Office 365 motion. It's sold with Microsoft 365. It's about the selling motion of E3 and E5 that we talk about. If you could almost take out that 606 impact in the billings team to almost mirror the Microsoft 365 SKUs we sell.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.\nJennifer Lowe: I appreciate getting the sort of visibility you have into the, as someone earlier alluded to, transactional businesses. It sounds like you feel pretty good or at least stable about the PC outlook for the remainder of this year. But given that Windows is a pretty material driver of profitability at Microsoft, if we do start to see a more protracted decline in PC unit sales and you think about your investments going out through the remainder of this calendar year, are there opportunities to sort of flex down the cost structure at this point to preserve profitability in margins? Or should we assume that much of the investments happening right now are really tied to the commercial cloud and some of the lower margin but higher opportunity businesses and maybe there isn't so much of an offset? Just how should we think about contingency planning if we do see a weaker -- an extended weakening in the global economic climate?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, and Amy, you can add to it. See, first of all, I'd say the opportunity for our shareholders when they think about Microsoft has never been better. When I look at every business becoming a digital business and then take that opportunity and map that to our capability, we have the broadest platform of anyone in the tech sector to really help every customer in every country become that digital business. And we have the business model that aligns with them and their interests and the trust. And so therefore, from a secular perspective, we are all in on making sure that we invest in our commercial cloud as well as our investments in things like gaming and going after the opportunity that is there in front of us. And as you even think about Microsoft 365, the value proposition of Microsoft 365 transcends Windows and Office on Windows. We think about the relevance of our applications across all device sockets. We think about the security, identity management, information protection and all that value across all device sockets, so therefore, I feel very, very good about the product investments and the go-to-market investments we are making to really help our shareholders realize that growth potential that's available in what is going to be an increasingly digital world. And I'll let Amy answer.\nAmy Hood: Let me just add a little bit, Jennifer, when it comes to really your question around OEM. We know that the signals we get from especially our commercial customers is that there's a healthy demand for the value that exists in Windows 10. We're seeing it in terms of deployments on new and existing devices and the security and manageability value prop that comes with a modern device and the experiences that employers want their employees to have and be able to take advantage of, along with some of the end-of-support deadlines that we have talked about, there is still an opportunity for us to remain focused on and execute on through this calendar year. And I still feel quite good about that, including the signals we're getting in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: I wanted to focus on the data and database side of your business. We saw the acquisition this quarter of the Postgres company. If you think about the ecosystem around the world, a lot of the cloud guys are talking a lot about database. Can you kind of maybe talk a little bit what you see around Cosmos, the whole database offering that you have and what you see in terms of client adoption there?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, we feel very, very good about the data platform and the portfolio we have, whether it's on the relational side with obviously SQL and now Postgres support. And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database. And so therefore, I feel very, very good, as I said even earlier, whenever these customer digital transformation projects start, they start by really getting their data into shape. And what that means is you bring all the data in its native format. You need the full comprehensive platform and then the ability to able -- to do things like AI and analytics on top of all of this data. So our data platform growth as well as competitiveness is very good and increasing. And we're the only provider still who can do this in a hybrid way. That is the consistency between what happens at the edge to the cloud when it comes to data tier becomes even more important as edge scenarios become very, very real. So therefore, I feel very good about our data story in Citus, which is the company we just bought for the Postgres capability, is something that we are very excited about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Question on Azure and growth numbers this quarter were very strong. I'm wondering if you can talk about just your visibility into the growth in that business. A lot of that comes from enterprise agreements and commitments customers are making. Some of that's on sort of credits that they have to consume. I'm not sure if you're willing to give us sort of a growth kind of trajectory as you look out forward, but I think there's a lot of investor interest in terms of how much visibility [Technical Difficulty] your perspective.\nAmy Hood: Maybe I'll start, Satya. In terms of the Azure growth, most of the Azure growth is really driven by consumption. So this is about getting projects started, making those projects successful, making sure customers feel the value and get the value of their investment. And increasingly, that's why we've been talking a bit about the form of these contracts changing, larger commitments being made that are -- that land in bookings but not in unearned, right? So it's a bit different mechanism than you think about having in our standard EA, where it goes to the balance sheet and gets earned off. These are contracts that unless it is used and deployed and a customer gets value from, it does not land into the P&L. And so the part that looks a little bit more EA-like is the part we've talked about on a per-user basis, right? That's something you're going to deploy, whether that's EMS, is the best example. And so those have the characteristic you talk about, which is that it really comes from the EA and the recognition is more predictable. But on the IaaS and PaaS layer, that's about our execution each quarter and especially making an impact. The way that -- the only other way that, that Azure number, to think about it, is when we've talked about the Azure Hybrid Benefits that exist, those show up actually in the on-prem number, right, even if they ultimately get used on the Azure side. So there actually is some Azure Benefit revenue ultimately that shows \"is on-prem.\"\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Satya, in the last couple of quarters, you have announced a number of these large multiyear Azure wins with companies, including Walmart and Albertsons and Walgreens, as Keith mentioned earlier. I'm just curious whether you're sensing an amplified tailwind there due to Amazon's ambitions to actually compete with grocers and retailers and health care providers and other industries. And then, Amy, I am assuming that those wins are captured by this robustness that we're seeing in the commercial bookings growth, which is up 22%. But I guess, I don't understand if they're fully captured, if this is a consumption-based structure. Or are we only seeing a portion of those bookings if we look in the unearned revenue and in the KPI?\nSatya Nadella: Okay, I'll start. I mean, the first thing is to -- we need to have product truth and product competitiveness and capability to, first of all, play, and that's where I'll start. We have a very, very good compelling platform across our commercial cloud. That's what's really leading us to be able to do these types of partnerships that you referenced. It's clear that we also have a fantastic alignment of our business model with the interest of our customers. In other words, we want to make sure that we are, in fact, making our customers fully capable digital companies in their own right, whether they're in retail, whether they're in oil and gas, whether they're in health care because that's really what's in our long-term interest, which is to ensure that they have full digital capability, and then they'd use the subscriptions and the consumption capabilities of our cloud. And of course, that means we have a trusted relationship, which is a competitive advantage in a world where some of our competitors have more complex business models, where in some cases they give them platforms, in other cases where they compete with them or tax them. That's definitely something that I'm sure our customers pay attention to. But we are very focused on making sure that we have the right product that's competitive in the marketplace and then our business model that's long-term aligned with the interest of our customers, and we'll stay focused on it.\nAmy Hood: And to your second question, most of these larger contracts are showing up in that commercial bookings number, and we referenced that on these -- when we say the longer -- larger, longer-term contracts, that is where they show up. Very little shows up in unearned, and that's the distinction that we're starting to see in many of these Azure contracts. It will, as it gets used, go straight to that Azure revenue growth number on the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Satya, of late, you talked about Microsoft 365 being the new operating system, and I know you talked a bunch about that today. But as you think about going after the front-line worker, people you could not get to previously, how should we think about the TAM expansion from that from a seat standpoint?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, a good example of the first-line opportunity was something that you could have seen at NRF this January. We launched, for example, Teams for first-line workers, which had things like shift worker capabilities, secure messaging. One of the challenges in retail and in many other industries is what's that messaging tool that has actually got the security framework that they expect of any other enterprise tool as opposed to using one of these consumer messaging tools, which then all the liability is with the enterprise. So that's the opportunity we see, whether it's -- for all front line, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare. So that's the TAM expansion. So in other words, it can be -- start with Teams. It can start with some of our devices in the first-line worker. For example, one of the things that we see the most traction for HoloLens is with first-line workers. People in manufacturing and other in field service, where they were never issued a standard laptop or even a phone are being issued a HoloLens as their first computing device, and that's just because of the productivity it drives. So those are the kinds of TAM expansion we see across Microsoft 365.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.\nAleksandr Zukin: Satya, you guys reorganized the sales and customer service organization about 18 months ago quite substantially, and you're now seeing the benefits both around much larger deals and broader deals that we've discussed on this call for your products across the portfolio. I wanted to ask, as the deal complexity increases, are you seeing any impact to your sales cycles as a result? And is there any impact that you're seeing on sales cycles maybe not from that but from kind of the macro volatility that we've seen in the headlines?\nSatya Nadella: I mean, overall, a lot of our transformation, whether it's on the engineering side or on the marketing side or on the sales side, have all been driven by the opportunity we see with the broad platform capabilities we have across all of our commercial clouds, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365. So it is true that the deals are much broader, deeper. The relationships with the customers that we have now signed up with span a lot more of our capability and also drives a lot more of their own ambition. So for sure, the sales cycles are different. But at the same time, you've got to remember, at Microsoft, we do have a lot of different business that we do with the customers, which may include some things like refreshes of their on-premise infrastructure all the way to some very high-ambition digital transformation projects. So I would say we are well equipped to deal with that complexity and the variability of what our customers want us to be helping them with. And that's where a lot of the transformation we have done internally is helping us accelerate our Cloud business.\nAmy Hood: And I think the way we've seen this in the field is -- and our sales organization has been not unlike some of these Dynamics transactions or the Power platform transactions that require a fundamental understanding of business process and the changes you're trying to implement. Those do naturally have longer sales cycles. Azure has many of those same attributes at the higher end of the complexity and digital transformation Satya's talking about. And in these very large transactions, many of which we've been signing recently, where you'll see some of that volatility would be in bookings. But I think, in general, the goal is to have -- and continue to build on that business, but certainly, that would be where the \"volatility\" would show up.\nMichael Spencer: Okay. Well, thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2019, delivering record revenue and profit. Every organization today needs tech intensity to compete and grow in an increasingly digital world. There are two aspects to this. Think of it as a simple equation. First, every organization needs to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology, second, they'll need to build their own proprietary digital capability. Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity, while ensuring we're addressing their tough questions around trust, both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success. No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other. Getting this equation right is key to their success going forward. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help. Now I'll briefly highlight how we are innovating across our solution areas. A little over a year ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to help organizations of all sizes empower their employees in the modern workplace. Today it's a multi-billion dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and under-penetrated markets. Customers from large multinationals like Eli Lilly to Rio Tinto first-line field workers to small businesses that are all choosing Microsoft 365. Cybersecurity is a central challenge. Microsoft Security differentiation is based on two things: first, our unparalleled operational security posture, second, our comprehensive product suite spanning identity, information, application and device protection. We analyze more than 6.5 trillion signals each day, process 450 billion authentications monthly and scan 400 billion e-mails for malware and phishing each month. This massive signals generate insights that fuel security innovations for customers. New capabilities in Microsoft 365 detect, investigate and remediate sophisticated cybersecurity threats across every endpoint, saving IT professionals thousands of hours. Microsoft Security Score gives organizations a dynamic report card on their security posture. In identity management, Microsoft is already a leader with Azure Active Directory and we are innovating with new capabilities to eliminate passwords for the hundreds of thousands of Azure AD connected apps that businesses use every day. The future of productivity and collaboration will be defined by AI innovation and new AI-driven features across Microsoft 365 from automated slide design to proactive Cortana reminders to enhanced search experiences and real-time meeting transcription to org analytics are all augmenting human capability, making it easier for people to focus on what matters most. Another differentiator is Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, video conferencing, meetings, and web-based collab into a single integrated user experience scaffolding. It eliminates the need for discrete single-point solutions that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure. Customers recognize this value. Teams is now the hub for teamwork for 329,000 organizations, including 87 of the Fortune 100 And we are adding automated translation support for meetings, shift scheduling for first-line workers, and new industry-specific offerings including healthcare and small business. Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system and more than half of our commercial device installed base is now on Windows 10. Surface continues to set the bar for the industry with five new category-leading Surface devices including the new Surface Go. Microsoft 365 and Surface are inspiring our OEM ecosystems to innovate and we have the strongest line of devices going into the holiday season. Moving to business applications, AI-powered digital feedback loops that connect products, operations, customers, and employees to create predictive power, automate workflows, and ultimately improve outcomes are key to all organizations. Dynamics 365 uniquely addresses this need. We expect Dynamics to deliver more than $2.5 billion in revenue this year with half of that total coming from Dynamics 365. And this quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where the systems of record and engagement are converted into intelligence. Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality digitizes the physical spaces and interactions. Companies like Chevron and ZF Group are already using it to transform training and design for their first-line workers, and H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer is relying on Dynamics 365 to digitize its critical business processes. These customers and others recognize the advantage of our modular extensible approach over the traditional SaaS model of monolithic suites of siloed apps. And our investments in our analytics and application platform spanning Power BI, PowerApps, and Flow are driving momentum with customers and have made us a leader in no-code app building and business analytics in the cloud. Our Open Data Initiative, a strategic partnership with Adobe and SAP takes this even further, delivering on our vision of one unified data model to provide unparalleled business insight from behavioral, transactional, financial and operational data. Together we'll enable data to be exchanged and enriched across systems, making it a renewable resource that enables new intelligent customer experiences. LinkedIn continues to be an essential platform to connect the world's professionals, with sessions growth of 34% year-over-year and record levels of messages sent and content shared. We're innovating with new experiences that leverage the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs such as the ability to e-mail LinkedIn connections directly from Microsoft 365. Strong engagement across the platform is fueling demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and talent solutions, which saw record job postings again this quarter. Talent Insights is a new self-service analytics solution that gives HR professionals competitive intelligence and labor market trends for an increasingly competitive jobs market. And the pending acquisition of Glint brings employee insights alongside LinkedIn's Workforce Insights to create a powerful solution to help customers attract, retain and develop the best talent. Now turning to Azure. Customers from multinationals like Volkswagen, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Mastercard to fast-growing startups like Grab are recognizing the architectural advantage of a consistent computing stack from the cloud to the edge. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application, platform, as well as security and management. We introduced 100 new Azure capabilities this quarter alone, focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and edge AI. With Azure Confidential Computing, Azure is now the first cloud to provide a secure platform for protecting the confidentiality and the integrity of data while in use adding to our existing security protections to encrypt data in transit as well as in rest. Every company needs a strategy to take advantage of the billions of IoT devices entering the market each year. Azure Sphere, our end-to-end solution for securing microcontroller powered devices is now broadly available and seeing strong customer interest. Azure Digital Twins is a new service that models relationships and interactions across people, places and devices. We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data. Our data services spanning SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, and Data Lake provide the most comprehensive data platform needed for enterprise data estates. Azure ML builds on this foundation to further democratize data and AI to unlock insights, helping data scientists build and train AI models faster then deploy them through the cloud or to the Edge. Across industries, our customers and partners are using services like these to transform. BMW introduced an agent to redefine how people interact with their cars. Beulah, which processes 65% of the world's grain, is relying on Azure Cognitive Services to improve food safety. Shell is applying AI across its enterprise to optimize deal productivity and keep workers safe. And this week at Sibos Conference, the Microsoft cloud is front and center, powering financial services transformation for organizations such as SWIFT, which is enabling secure payment transfers on Azure. Finally, our pending acquisition of GitHub, which we expect to close shortly, recognizes the increasingly vital role developers play in value creation and growth across every industry. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos. Now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to broaden our reach with more than 2 billion gamers worldwide and expand our opportunity, from the way games are distributed, to how they're played and viewed. We are investing in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement. First-party content is key to our approach and we now have 11 game studios in our portfolio to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing services like Game Pass. Xbox Live now has 57 million monthly active users and Mixer usage growth is accelerating. This loyal, high-value community is our strongest asset, creating expanding opportunity for monetization of first- and third-party games. Fortnite is a good example of that and all up, we are seeing record software and services revenue and engagement being driven on our platform. Earlier this month, we announced Project xCloud, a breakthrough game streaming technology that puts gamers at the center of their gaming experience, enabling them to play games in high fidelity wherever and whenever they want on any device. And it will empower game developers to scale to hundreds of millions of new users across devices. It's early days, but I'm excited about our road map. Across our businesses, we are accelerating innovation, picking the right secular trends, investing in large growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy. Additionally, every one of our solutions is reinforcing our core intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. Not only are we optimistic about the opportunity for us and for our customers, we also recognize our responsibility. We were one of the first companies in the United States to require suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time off for their employees. And this quarter we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave. We're ensuring that our enterprise class security innovation not only helps our largest customers but also protects small businesses and consumers who are often the most vulnerable to attacks. Finally, we are putting AI into the hands of change makers to address society's most pressing challenges with initiatives like AI for Humanitarian Action, which supports critical disaster recovery efforts around the world and more. This recognition of our broader responsibility coupled with our bold innovation makes me incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead. With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $29.1 billion, up 19% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18%. Operating income increased 29% and 28% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 36% and 33% in constant currency, another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating income growth drove a record start to the fiscal year. We saw strength across each of our segments with strong sales execution by our partners and sales teams. Customer demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove the quarter and we continued to benefit from favorable macroeconomic and IT spending trends. Now to our commercial business. As a reminder, starting this quarter, the commercial portion of LinkedIn is included in these metrics. Our commercial revenue annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 90%. Commercial unearned revenue was $27.3 billion, growing 22% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. On an expiry base that was roughly flat year-over-year, commercial bookings were better than expected and increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, benefiting from larger long-term Azure contracts, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts and strength in on-premises revenue. These contract types impact bookings, reported revenue and unearned revenue in different ways. Let me explain. First, under ASC 606, hybrid and on-premises offerings drive bookings growth and more in-period revenue recognition. Therefore, there's less impact on unearned revenue. Second, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts drive bookings growth and in-period revenue, but have little impact on unearned revenue. And finally, long-term Azure contracts drive significant bookings growth, but have a smaller impact on in-period revenue and unearned revenue. The inclusion of LinkedIn results was immaterial to the growth rates of commercial unearned and commercial bookings. Commercial cloud revenue was $8.5 billion, growing 47% and 46% in constant currency with strong performance in the U.S., Western Europe and the UK. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 62%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Company level, gross margin percentage was 66%, down slightly year-over-year, with sales mix shift to gaming and commercial cloud. FX increased overall company and Productivity and Business Processes revenue by 1 point, in line with guidance. The impact to Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue was immaterial, 1 point less favorable than expected. FX impact was immaterial to COGS and operating expenses, about 1 point less favorable than expected. Even with that headwind, operating expenses grew 8%, in line with expectations. Our engineering and sales capacity investments in large growing markets continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers, while generating material operating income leverage. This quarter, we increased operating margin nearly 3 points year-over-year. Now to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.8 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both the on-premises and cloud businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 17% and 16% in constant currency, driven by continued Office 365 commercial growth and approximately 3 points of growth from increased demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, with installed base expansion across all customer segments and ARPU growth as customers shift to E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%, and in line with last quarter, benefited from strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office consumer revenue increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue and approximately 5 points of growth from increased channel demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 32.5 million. Dynamics revenue grew 20%, including a few points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition under ASC 606. Dynamics 365 grew 51% and 49% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 33% with strong execution across all businesses. Segment gross margin dollars grew 18% and 17% in constant currency and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as cloud mix offset LinkedIn and Office 365 margin expansion. Operating expenses increased 7% and 8% in constant currency with ongoing investments in LinkedIn, cloud engineering and commercial sales capacity to support top-line growth. Operating income increased 29% and 27% in constant currency. Revenue from Intelligent Cloud was $8.6 billion, increasing 24%, better than anticipated, driven by demand for our hybrid offerings. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 28%. Azure revenue increased 76%, in line with our expectations with strong growth across both consumption and per-user base businesses. Our on-premises server business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by continued demand for premium versions and hybrid solutions, as well as increased demand ahead of Q2 price increases for certain versions of our server products. Enterprise services revenue grew 6% as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 27% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by ongoing investments in cloud and AI engineering and commercial sales capacity. Operating income grew 37% and 35% in constant currency. Now to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.7 billion, increasing 15% with significantly better than expected results in gaming. Gaming revenue increased 44% and 45% in constant currency with better than expected results across both software and services and hardware. Xbox software and services revenue grew 36%, with continued strength from a third-party title. Xbox hardware revenue grew 94% and 96% in constant currency with earlier than expected sell-in of holiday hardware bundles. In Windows, we saw healthy Windows 10 commercial deployments as the OEM ecosystem continued to benefit from customer demand for modern and secure software and hardware. OEM Pro revenue grew 8%, a few points ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium licenses. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 12%. In consumer, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 5%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range. Search revenue ex-TAC increased 17%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. In Surface, revenue grew 14%, driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go. Segment gross margin dollars grew 10% and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin gaming business. Operating expenses declined 1%. As a result, operating income grew 23%. Now back to our total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including financed leases were up sequentially to $4.3 billion, driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment was $3.6 billion. Free cash flow was $10.1 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business. Cash flow from operations increased 10% year-over-year with strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by our first annual TCJA payment of $1.5 billion. Excluding the TCJA payment, free cash flow grew 12% and operating cash flow grew 22%. Other income was $266 million, higher than anticipated, due to realized gains in the recording of mark-to-market gains under the new accounting rules for financial investments. Our effective tax rate was 14%. As a reminder Q1 and Q3 rates are impacted by the volume of equity vest during those quarters. This Q1, the impact was a bit more than expected due to the movement of our share price within the quarter. And finally, in line with our continued commitment, we returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 27% year-over-year. Now let's turn to our outlook. Given that we expect the GitHub acquisition to close shortly, my commentary includes the full impact of the deal including purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. We continue to expect the deal to be minimally dilutive to FY 2019 and FY 2020 EPS on a non-GAAP basis and accretive to FY 2020 operating income on a non-GAAP basis. For Q2, first FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect no impact to revenue growth. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Second, our commercial business. We expect another quarter of healthy performance with solid bookings growth. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to grow approximately 19% year-over-year even with the ongoing shift toward the cloud contracts discussed earlier. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should continue to improve on a year-over-year basis though at a more moderated rate than prior years given the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Margin improvement will continue to vary on a quarterly basis driven by revenue mix, seasonality and the timing of infrastructure spend. Third, we expect ongoing year-over-year growth in capital expenditure as we support growing demand. Given infrastructure spend timing, Q2 CapEx should be roughly in line with Q1. Now to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion and $10.15 billion. Office commercial and Dynamics should continue to exhibit double-digit growth, driven by strong cloud performance but with some moderation due to the on-premise drivers discussed earlier. Office consumer will see continued momentum in new subscribers but overall revenue growth will be negatively impacted as channel inventories normalize. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain healthy though on a stronger prior-year comparable. For Intelligent Cloud, which includes GitHub, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion. In Azure, we expect healthy growth across our consumption and per-user base businesses though per-user services growth will moderate given the size of the installed base. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.8 billion and $13.2 billion. OEM Pro revenue growth should be in line with the commercial PC market. As a reminder, prior year comparables strengthened throughout the remainder of the year. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect continued strength, as well as the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. And for OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics to Q1. In Surface, revenue growth should accelerate, with the impact of recently launched devices including Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2. Search ex-TAC results should be similar to Q1 with durable growth in rate and volume. In gaming, we expect revenue growth to moderate due to a prior year comparable that included the launch of Xbox One X. Software and services growth should be similar to Q1, with continued benefit from a third-party title plus overall platform strength. Now back to our company results. We expect COGS of $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion and operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income and investment gains are partially offset by interest expense. And finally we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full year estimate of 17%. Now a few comments on the fiscal year. First FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a 1 point headwind to full-year revenue growth with any benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Second, operating expenses. We remain unchanged in our commitment to invest in strategic priorities that are key to driving long-term value creation. With the addition of GitHub as a strategic priority, we now expect operating expenses to grow roughly 8%. Growth excluding GitHub is expected to be in line with our prior guidance of roughly 7%. Third, on operating margin. Even with the full GAAP impact of GitHub purchase accounting now included in our guidance, we continue to expect our operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year. Margin leverage is a direct result of our focused investments in the right technology trends coupled with consistent execution. For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate even as we meet demand for our cloud services. Regarding the GitHub acquisition, we remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace, though it's expected to fully offset stock consideration issue in the transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability. And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.\n[0JNPYG-E Michael Spencer]: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much for the question. Amy and Satya, if I look at your Intelligent Cloud segment, and in particular the server products and cloud services, those continue to defy gravity a little bit here. And I'm just wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much may be the pricing changes that went into effect at the beginning of the quarter that you're in now might have helped drive spending last quarter ahead of them going into effect. But also, can you share with us how the Azure Hybrid Benefit message might also be impacting Azure growth rates? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. Thanks Heather for the question. I'll start and then Amy you can add. I mean, I think what you're fundamentally seeing in that overall KPI is what I think are two major advantages we have. One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid, right. So we don't think of hybrid as some stopgap as a move to the cloud. We think about it's the coming together of distributed computing where the cloud and the edge work together for not just the old workloads, but most importantly for new workloads. And that's where we are seeing some very significant good feedback loops and shaping even our future road map. And this is a place where we are leading. The second thing, as you pointed out in your question, is we have a business model advantage. The Azure benefits are things both for Windows Server as well as for SQL which I think are very, very unique to us and you see that. So the combination of the technology advantage and the business model advantage is what I see in the results, whether it's the standalone Azure growth, which is what we expected and it's very strong and the server KPI is even stronger. So I think that's at least how I would answer that question.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: And to your specific question, Heather, on the impact of some of the price increases that went into effect in Q2, I'd say it's a couple of points. So I would not sort of over-rotate on that topic. The overall number, even if you take a couple points off that 28% is a very good performance, that I believe to Satya's point, is the impact you've seen of the very aligned technology road map on the architecture plus a business model that matches it.\nHeather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Heather. Operator, we'll take the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter guys. I wanted to dig into capital efficiency here around your cloud assets a little bit. This quarter you talked about Azure gross margins coming in, sort of continuing to improve really nicely. CapEx came in. I mean the growth there is slowing a little bit. Can you talk to us about sort of what's kind of driving that? Is it sort of the move to higher-level services so you get like better pricing against the capital? Is this sort of you're just not sort of pouring down as much cement, if you will, in terms of database expansion? Is it like better productivity of the core sort of compute stuff? Like can you help us understand sort of how capital intensity is trending in that Azure in particular but more broadly in the cloud businesses?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: It's a great question, Keith. I would say the way we think about our capital efficiency and I in fact added that even to my commentary this time, which is we're building this intelligent cloud, intelligent edge platform to span everything, not only the Azure business but also the future of game streaming to what we are doing at Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365. For the first time, what you see across Microsoft is really one platform which spans all of these businesses and all of the margin structures that are there represented in it. So that's where if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end-to-end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces, because we think that's what Microsoft's uniqueness long term lies. But that said on Azure, you're absolutely right. What you are seeing is two things. One is things like the Azure Hybrid Benefits as well as the higher-level services that create I think uniqueness both as well as good margins long term. I mean, especially on the database side is one place where I would say from a year-over-year worth of progress, whether it's just Azure database by itself. I mean that service with full compatibility with SQL Server is a fantastic value proposition for our customers who have huge estates whether it's the Data Warehouse that's become very, very competitive, the Data Lake. And Cosmos DB I think is very unique in its capability. So that's one place where as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Keith. Operator, we'll move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey. Thanks, guys, for talking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office. Obviously, Amy, you called out some of the positives from the price increase that's coming up. But if I look at just Office 365 both commercial and consumer, just continued just strong growth on both those two. And especially on the commercial side, there's still that gap between seat growth and revenue growth. So if you kind of just think where you are and I guess in terms of just sort of the life cycle here and obviously, we've got multiple SKUs, maybe just kind of give us an update of how you're sort of think about where you stand and then especially as you think about the full year here, how you sort of expect these metrics to progress?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. And I'm actually going to expand my comments a little bit because the sales motion is really broader than Office 365. The sales motion is really about Microsoft 365. And what that encompasses is both the Office 365 value proposition, but also our management and security value proposition with EMS as well as Advanced Threat Protection and Windows value that shows up in that Windows commercial services KPI. So the bucket of those together, what we're seeing is many of the workloads and movement to E3 within Microsoft 365 and to E5 continue to have good pull. There's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics, in meetings, in voice, in collab. And I think when you look at the value, I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users including new first-line or frontline users that we've not had access before. We got room on user growth, which you continue to see that number go up across segments. And we've got room in ARPU, which you've continued to see us have. So in many ways your question shows itself in Office, but the trends are the same if you look at EMS growth or if you were to look at that Windows commercial growth number.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: And I'd just add that the seat growth as well as the ARPU growth, one of the things even in spite of the success we may have achieved in the past, we never were that successful in penetrating with all of our workloads when it comes to small business and definitely across the globe. So that's another dimension that you see play out as well.\nPhilip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Awesome. Thanks.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thanks, Phil. Yeah, thanks, Phil. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking it. Satya, can you focus on gaming for a little bit? With the xCloud you kind of announced something that the whole industry have kind of been dreaming about as like the Holy Grail where you want to go eventually have it all in the cloud, delivered from the cloud and subscription service. Can you talk a little bit about the innovation that is involved in you being able to starting to deliver that now? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. But before I get to streaming, the thing that I'll say is most critical when you think about gaming is having a platform where the gamers are already there. That means you need to have a platform that has a community around it and monetize as well. So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter, that's the foundation of Xbox. Xbox has the key gaming community and the monetization capabilities. Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best-in-class in that monetization and that's what's reflected in the results. So given that structural position, we are going to make sure that we keep increasing the strength of the community. You see that already with Minecraft going to all platforms and that increasing the intensity of the community and you'll see us do more of that. Obviously, bringing Game Pass to even the PC is going to be a big element of that. And then streaming is just a natural sequence of it. And the advantage we have with streaming is, we have a massive cloud advantage. And so we're going to bring obviously what we're doing with Azure, Azure networking, all to bear in ensuring that Xbox and xCloud is one of the best workloads for it. So that's how I see it. It, of course, will increase our reach, but what I am most excited about is the core content and community and the platform we have for monetizing that usage. And that I think is really what gives us even the permission to think about streaming.\nRaimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we'll please move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. I know you mentioned GitHub is closing soon. It's obviously not closed yet. But given you've got a few months under your belt now since it was announced and an opportunity to solicit some feedback from the developer communities that maybe aren't using Microsoft technologies on a regular basis, but are very active with GitHub, do you have a sense yet of what the opportunities might be to do outreach to those developers that might be working closely with competing platforms? And how closely you can kind of hug them into the Microsoft ecosystem versus just leaving GitHub as sort of a self-sustaining entity now that you have a little bit more opportunities to discuss that with customers in the field?\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. First of all, thank you for the question. We're very excited about GitHub closing. And quite frankly, primarily I'm excited because for us, as I've always said, GitHub is not a means to some other end. It's an end on to its own, which is, we've always cared about developer and developer productivity and especially at a time like this when there are more developers outside of the tech industry as the world goes digital. We think this is perhaps one of the big SaaS opportunities going forward. And so therefore that's why we want to ensure that everything we do and the number one priority for Nat and team at GitHub will be all about maintaining that GitHub community, the ethos around developers at the core. That said, I think we will do what is necessary to make sure that our products and services that are on Azure or elsewhere, our tooling, which are already many open source projects on GitHub, we do a good job of earning that developer trust and developer adoption. But we are very grounded in the fact that it has to be earned and not something that we will inherit because of being owners of GitHub. The second thing I'll also mention is that, to me the opportunity to win, I would say, new class of developers, we are making progress. In fact, this morning I was reading a news article in Hacker News, which is a community where we have been working hard to make sure that Azure is growing in popularity. And I was pleasantly surprised to see that we have made a lot of progress, in some sense, that at least basically said that we are neck to neck with Amazon when it comes to even elite developers as represented in that community. So we have more work to do, but we're making progress on all dimensions.\nJennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Jen. Operator, we'll move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks very much and congrats on a great start to the year. Amy, in your comments, you cited the continued benefit from a strong IT spending environment and it's very clear from your results there's a lot of Microsoft-specific success and execution happening here as well. But as you look at your pipelines and all the various signals you see in the market, do you have a view on how long the environment persists and what are the indicators that give you confidence?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Brad, for the question. In general, the way I tend to look at this is the interactions we have with customers and the markets we're in and do we feel like they're expansive. And so, when I look at the businesses that we've built and the businesses we're investing in and do I feel like this needs for tech intensity that Satya talked about, that will ultimately drive the desire and need for customers to adopt technology, we're in the right places. And that's the signal actually we hear back from customers, whether that is Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and a new worldview on what business processes and business applications can look like. Whether it's frankly our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI to them, no matter what that IT budget looks like. And so I think as long as we focus on providing that value, we'll feel good about our opportunity to both grow and take share in the market.\nBrad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Fantastic. Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Brad. Yeah, thanks Brad. Operator, we'll please move to next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about Azure, the outlook for the year. I know growth rate's been a bit volatile. I think you had a pretty strong Q4 including (45:02) that business. Maybe you could help us understand relative to the growth we're seeing right now how you expect the Azure trajectory to play out for the year?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. Let me spend a couple minutes on that. We actually saw better bookings in Q1 again on Azure, as I mentioned, just like we did in Q4. And so obviously that's certainly encouraging as we look on a go-forward basis for the rest of the year. But as I think about \u2013 I tend to focus as you know on the all-up server and product KPI because the Azure hybrid benefits that exist with Windows Server and SQL Server are really valuable to customers if they want to move to Azure on their own terms, is the single best value proposition to a customer to make a commitment there. And so, if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go-to-market is actually through the overall product portfolio. And so, I tend to probably as you might imagine be more confident than I was in coming out of Q4 with a strong Q1 in that overall hybrid demand and Azure signal plus good Azure bookings when I talked about my confidence in high teens growth in that KPI for the rest of the year.\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Great. Thank you, Amy.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Thanks, Walter. Operator we'll take the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you, and I will add my congrats. Amy, last quarter you had mentioned that you could see increased volatility in time, in commercial bookings growth as you were talking about the commitments were increasing to larger and longer-term agreements. But this quarter, the ex-free portfolio was flattish and yet your commercial bookings grew 16%. I think presumably a very powerful performance with the renewals, the expansions and the new bookings, and I don't think you repeated that comment about bookings volatility in the same way. So I'm just curious, maybe could you help us connect the dots on that performance and also the potential for volatility in either direction going forward?\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Sure, thank you. That's a great question. You will see volatility in the bookings number for the reasons we've laid out before, the changing expiry base, but also large contracts and commitments done by Azure. And to your point, we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw a quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts which added on a flat expiry base to that 15% bookings growth, which was good. And so what that means is, you'll see some volatility in that and you're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned, specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength, it won't land as much in unearned. So as the business gets bigger and we do bigger and larger deals and some of them are on-prem and some of them are in Azure, you're going to see volatility frankly in both of those. But what I try to do is think about the impact of all the key data points which is how did we do in-quarter, how did we do on the unearned revenue on the balance sheet and how did we do in overall bookings. And if I triangulate between all those three, just like I did in Q4, I feel really good about our commercial performance.\nMark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much. Maybe two for Amy. Just first on that KPI of Azure plus server products, that high teens number was obviously a lot better this quarter. But is that still the framework for the year? And then actually on Windows, we've seen such elevated strength on the Pro side, I think because of the corporate Win 10 cycle. And I wondered if you could just, as we think about the back half of the current fiscal year and we come up against some tougher comps, I wondered if you could just help us sort of think through that and how we should think about the puts and takes on that refresh cycle? Thanks.\nAmy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.: Sure. On the first question on the server and product KPI, obviously the strong performance this quarter gives me higher confidence in my commitment to high teens growth in that number. But I'll update that generally longer in the quarter and will give me through Q2 before I make a longer commitment. And then separately on Windows 10 and the strength we've seen in OEM Pro, and I would also say it mirrors in some ways you're also going to see some of that growth and strength in Windows commercial, so let me answer them a bit together. The Windows 10 Pro strength and I think commercial strength we've seen, we continue to see good signs on the commercial refresh, really security, manageability of modern hardware and software together continues to be a good signal for us. We continue to watch the end of support. It's really critical for us for customers to have a terrific experience as we upgrade them and ask them to move to Windows 10 with a lot of value. That end of support is about five quarters away, so we'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment. And it should, to your point, match increasingly the market and we do get to some slightly bigger comps in H2 which I would agree with. But I don't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrades in modern hardware when they realize the benefits. And so even if you have a tougher comp, I think the demand signal and our opportunity to continue to sell Microsoft 365 in that process and then upgrade to Office 365 as they do deployments is a big opportunity for us to excel.\nRoss MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much.\nMichael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.: Great. Thanks, Ross. Operator, this will be our last question. We'll take it now please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks very much. Maybe one for Satya. Satya, as you think about the Dynamics business going forward, how do you weigh the potential need to do a larger acquisition there versus just organic development or small tuck-ins? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.: Yeah. I mean overall, I feel very, very good about the opportunity ahead in business applications for us. And I think about the combination of both Dynamics 365 as well as what we're doing on the LinkedIn side. They all represent our participation in business applications. And the thing that I \u2013 what's happening out there in the marketplace is, as things become more digital, there is in fact more need for business process automation. At the same time, there is a need for the application suite to be built very differently. And that's where I think we have an architectural advantage again with Dynamics 365. It's much more modular, it's modern, it's extensible with this power platform that gives us the ability to do things for customers and serve them in ways that is very differentiated. So that's our primary focus. We'll always look at opportunities outside. But in a time when there is a real fundamental shift in the category when it comes to both business models and technology, we feel we're well positioned to ride that.\nBrad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much.\n[0JNPYG-E Michael Spencer]: Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion for today's earnings call.

We delivered record results this fiscal year powered by our commercial cloud, which surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, up 36% year-over-year. The last five months have made it very clear that digital tech intensity is key to business resilience. Organizations that build their own digital capability will recover faster and emerge from this crisis stronger. We are seeing businesses accelerate the digitization of every part of their operations from manufacturing to sales and customer service to reimagine how they meet customer needs from curbside pickup and contactless shopping in retail to telemedicine in healthcare. That's why we are building the full modern technology stack powered by cloud and AI and underpinned by security and compliance to help every organization digitally transform.  Now, I\u2019ll highlight our innovation and momentum, starting with Azure. Every organization today needs a distributed computing fabric to run essential workloads. We are building Azure as the world's computer to support them with data center regions -- more data center regions than any other provider, including new regions as of this quarter in Italy, New Zealand, and Poland. We have always led in hybrid and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers\u2019 needs, wherever they are. Azure Arc is the first control plane built for a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, and we're taking it further with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes. New capabilities in Azure Stack HCI help organizations bring the cloud to their very own data centers. And our acquisitions of Affirmed and Metaswitch along with Azure Edge Zones extend Azure to the network edge expanding our offering to telecom operators as they move to 5G. Our differentiated approach across cloud and edge is winning new customers in every industry from Land O'Lakes, the National Australia Bank to Johns Hopkins Medicine, as well as leading ISVs, including Citrix, Finastra, SAS, and Workday. At the data layer, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that can deliver a cloud-native data estate for every organization. The combination of SQL Hyperscale Cosmos DB, Synapse Analytics and the new Synapse Link, which enables live analytics on real-time transactions differentiate Azure. In AI, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks, and infrastructure. We're thrilled with the progress our partner OpenAI is making. Their new GPT3 model constitutes a new breakthrough in AI and retrained -- and was trained on our Azure AI supercomputer. New capabilities in Azure Cognitive Services make it easier to build applications that speak naturally in 49 languages and its variants and to generate insights from unstructured data, including paper-based forms and medical records. Microsoft Bot Framework now includes powerful authoring tools to build sophisticated conversational bots with low-code and with Azure Machine Learning organizations can deploy AI more responsibly and safely.  All this innovation is driving usage. In June alone 13.5 billion transactions were processed in Azure Cognitive Services, 2.5 billion messages sent, 9 million hours of speech transcribed. From Bridgestone to UnitedHealth Group to EY, companies are relying on Azure AI to innovate and better meet customer needs. Now to developer tools. The role of developers is more important than ever from emergency response to recovery to reimagining the world, we have the most used and loved developer tools to build any application for any platform. We have seen increased activity across multiple measures, and we are going further with new tools to power, secure remote development. With Codespaces, we are bringing together the best of GitHub, Visual Studio, and Azure to help developers go from code to cloud in seconds. New advanced security features in GitHub uses semantic analysis to scan code for vulnerabilities and GitHub Discussions help software communities collaborate outside of the code base. More than 3 million organizations, including the majority of the Fortune 50 now use GitHub. The State of California is using GitHub and Azure DevOps to power 90% of its digital COVID-19 response infrastructure. All the 5,000 engineers at Autodesk rely on GitHub to break down silos across the organization. And at Etsy, developers are using GitHub to deploy production -- to production more than 50 times per day. Now, the Power Platform. With Power Platform, anyone in an organization can rapidly create an application, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow, or analyze data. Citizen developers and business decision makers at companies like Schlumberger and T-Mobile are using Power Platform to address challenges created by COVID-19. Power BI is the clear leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing significantly faster than competition. 96% of the Fortune 500 now use Power BI to find insights in their data. More broadly, across the Power Platform, we're seeing accelerating usage. Power Apps monthly active users increased 170% year-over-year, Power Automate is up 75%. And in just six months, Power Virtual Agents are already surpassed 6.7 million sessions. Just yesterday, we launched an end-to-end return to workplace solution in Power Platform that will help organizations like CBRE keep employees safe and healthy when they go back to their office. And we continue to invest in robotic process automation. Our acquisition of Softomotive when coupled with Power Automate enables customers including KPMG to automate manual business processes across both, legacy as well as modern applications. Now to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is helping organizations in every industry digitize their end-to-end business operations from sales and customer service to supply chain management, so that they can rapidly adapt to changing market conditions. Customer Insights is the fastest growing Dynamics 365 application ever, helping organizations like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Chipotle offer more personalized customer experiences. BNY Mellon chose Dynamics 365 this quarter to help investment managers build stronger relations with their customers. More than 4,500 organizations now use Dynamics 365 Commerce, Finance and Supply Chain Management, making it one of the fastest growing SaaS solutions in its category. FedEx for example, uses Dynamics 365 to drive more precise logistics and inventory management. In retail, Dynamics 365 Connected Store now offers in-store traffic analytics and curbside pickup prioritizing safety as stores reopen, and we continue to invest in solutions to protect merchants as they process more online transactions. New account protection and loss prevention features in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection help protect online revenue, and we are working with financial services firms like Capital One to improve fraud detection and keep customers secure. Now, to LinkedIn. In spite of revenue headwinds due to lower hiring needs, we are seeing record engagements as LinkedIn\u2019s more than 706 million professionals turn to the network to connect, learn and plan for the future. Content shared with nearly -- up nearly 50% year-over-year and LinkedIn Live streams were up 89% since March. People will increasingly need to move beyond current domain expertise to learn new skills, and they turn into LinkedIn. Professionals watched nearly four times the amount of LinkedIn learning content in June than they did a year ago. And we're making it easier for them to access LinkedIn Learning\u2019s more than 16,000 online courses directly in the flow of their work. Our new learning app and Teams will allow organizations to integrate LinkedIn Learning as well as their own content to create a continuous feedback loop between work, skills and the learning needed for upskilling and reskilling employees. Now, to Microsoft 365 and Teams. When, where and how the world works is fundamentally changing. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working as well as learning. Microsoft Teams is helping people be together even when they are apart. It\u2019s the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content, collaboration with office as well as business process workflows in a secure, integrated user experience. We are reimagining every aspect of the meetings experience with new capabilities like Together Mode and the Dynamic Stage to help people feel more connected and reduce cognitive load. We expanded the gallery view in Teams, so that people can see and interact with up to 49 participants at a time, and breakout rooms and live reactions will help people build social capital in a virtual world. Deeper integration between Teams and Power Platform brings an integrated data platform Microsoft Dataflex for easier, faster application creation and deployment, enabling a new category of enterprise-grade apps and chatbots in Teams. Teams is rapidly becoming the communications backbone as customers accelerate moving voice to the cloud. And we're expanding Teams beyond the workplace, making it easy to add personal Teams account on mobile, so you can stay connected with friends and family across work as well as your life. Teams users generated more than 5 billion meeting minutes in a single day this quarter, and we are seeing increased usage intensity across the platform as people communicate, collaborate and co-author content in Teams. 69 organizations now have more than a 100,000 users of Teams and over a 1,800 organizations have more than 10,000 users of Teams. We are working alongside educators as they prepare for remote hybrid and in-person scenarios this fall. More than a 150 million students and teachers around the world now rely on our tools, including Teams, Stream, OneNote as well as Flipgrid to prioritize student engagement and learning outcomes. Our new Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is helping providers schedule, manage and conduct virtual visits using Teams and engage with patients using Dynamics 365. In healthcare, there were more than 46 million Teams meetings this past month. The NHS in the UK chose Microsoft 365 to empower its 1.2 million employees with the latest productivity and collaboration tools to deliver better patient outcomes. More broadly, we're seeing increased usage of Microsoft 365 and larger strategic agreements. Alcoa and Telstra are empowering their entire workforce, including first line employees with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Across industries, customers like 3M, CenturyLink, GE and Providence are increasingly choosing our Microsoft 365 premium offerings for differentiated security, compliance, voice and analytics value. Our Microsoft 365 E5 user base more than doubled year-over-year. People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever with minutes spent in Windows 10 up more than 55% year-over-year. And we expanded our family of surface devices and accessories to help people work, learn and connect from anywhere as we create new categories that benefit the entire OEM ecosystem. Now, to security and compliance. Remote everything continues to accelerate the need for a zero trust security architecture that protects people, devices, applications and data holistically. And they're the only company with an integrated end to end capability informed by more than 8 trillion signals each day. Azure Active Directory now has more than 345 million monthly active users across more than 200,000 organizations. And we are not only securing employee identities but customer and partner identities as well. General Motors, for example, is using Azure Active Directory to secure interactions between its employees, dealers, and customers. Azure Sentinel now has more than 6,500 customers. The accelerating adoption of IoT across industries is creating new security challenges, and our acquisition of CyberX this quarter will help secure customers\u2019 IoT deployments. Finally, we are helping customers protect their most sensitive information. Microsoft Information Protection is enabling companies like Siemens AG to protect sensitive data wherever it exists. And new Microsoft 365 Records Management helps customers govern data and reduce risk. Now onto gaming. It was simply a breakthrough quarter for gaming. We saw record engagement and monetization, led by strength on and off-console, as people everywhere turn to gaming to connect, socialize, and play with others. Stepping back, we are expanding our opportunity to empower the world\u2019s 2 billion gamers to play wherever and whenever they want, on any device. Xbox Game Pass is seeing record subscriber growth across both, console and PC, and now includes content from more than 100 studios. Our xCloud gaming service is already live in 15 countries. And just last week, we announced that we will bring xCloud to Xbox Game Pass, so subscribers can stream games to a phone or tablet and play along with nearly 100 million Xbox Live players around the world. In content, we are delivering differentiated, first and third-party content to attract and retain gamers. Xbox Series X will launch this fall with the largest launch lineup for any console ever. And Minecraft reached a new high of nearly 132 million monthly active users during the quarter. In closing, we are expanding our opportunity and investing across the full modern, technology stack. Over the next decade, technology spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to double. And we are well positioned to participate in that growth by innovating and defining the key technologies that empower every person and every organization on the planet to build more of their own tech intensity. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $38 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 8% and 12% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $1.46, increasing 7% and 9% in constant currency when adjusting for the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties from the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201819. In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners again delivered strong results, with many similar trends to the end of the third quarter. In our commercial business, increased usage, consistent execution, and continued demand for our differentiated, high-value cloud services drove another strong quarter. And in our consumer business, increased demand from work, learn, and play from home scenarios again benefitted our Gaming, Surface, and Windows OEM non-Pro businesses. We also saw weakness in small and medium business purchasing, which primarily impacted our transactional Office and Windows OEM-Pro businesses, and drove some moderation to our Office 365 commercial paid seat growth. And in our Search business, though rates stabilized through the quarter, we saw a continued reduction in advertising spend on our platform. Moving to our overall results. Customer commitment to our cloud continues to grow. In FY20, we closed a record number of multi-million dollar commercial cloud agreements, with material growth in the number of $10-million-plus Azure contracts. And on a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 12% year-over-year driven by consistent renewal execution and an increase in the number of large, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 23% to $107 billion. Approximately 50% of this balance will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year, reflecting consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. The remaining 50%, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 25% year-over-year, highlighting the growing long-term customer commitment to our cloud platform. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased 4 points year-over-year to 94%. Commercial cloud revenue grew 30% and 32% in constant currency to $14.3 billion, surpassing $50 billion for the fiscal year. And commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 1 point to 66%, despite revenue mix shift to Azure and significant customer engagement and usage to support remote work scenarios. In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. FX had no impact on operating expense growth, slightly less favorable than expected. Our margins this quarter reflect investments to deliver greater customer value in this challenging environment and therefore strengthen our long-term competitive position. We invested in capacity for cloud infrastructure usage, free trial offers for critical remote work scenarios, and flexible financing options across the ecosystem. Additionally, we re-envisioned our retail stores strategy as we stayed focused on growing our investments in the strategic, high growth opportunities of the future. As a result, Company gross margin percentage was down 2 points year-over-year to 68%, with additional impact from lower margin sales mix. Operating expense grew 13%, including a $450 million charge related to the realignment of our retail stores strategy. And operating margins declined 2 points year-over-year to 35%. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion, increasing 6% and 8% in constant currency. Commercial -- office commercial revenue grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, impacted by the small and medium business slowdown noted earlier, as well as a strong prior year comparable where 4 points of growth were from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 19% and 22% in constant currency, in-line with expectations, and was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our high value security and voice components drove strong upsell to Office 365 and Microsoft 365 E5. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15% year-over-year, slightly below prior quarter trends. This reflects the strong adoption of free trial offers we made to enable customers to quickly adapt to needed remote work scenarios, as well as some growth moderation in first-line worker and small and medium business offerings. Office consumer revenue grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, as stronger than expected growth in Office 365 consumer subscriptions was partially offset by transactional weakness. As a result, we saw a significant quarter-over-quarter increase in Office 365 consumer subscribers, up more than 3 million to 42.7 million. Dynamics revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 38% and 40% in constant currency. This fiscal year, total Dynamics revenue surpassed $3 billion, with over 60% from Dynamics 365. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 11% in constant currency as a weak job market materially impacted annual bookings in our Talent Solutions business even as usage remained high. Segment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 3% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year-over-year. Operating expense increased 10% and 11% in constant currency, and operating income decreased 9% and 5% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $13.4 billion, increasing 17% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 47% and 50% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business. In our per-user business, growth continued to moderate, given the size of our enterprise mobility installed base, which grew 26% to over 147 million seats. And our on-premise server business was relatively unchanged and grew 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by strong renewal execution and continued demand for our hybrid and premium solutions. Enterprise Services revenue was relatively unchanged and grew 2% in constant currency as growth in Premier Support Services offset consulting delays. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year. Operating expense increased 19%, and operating income grew 19% and 22% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $12.9 billion, increasing 14% and 16% in constant currency with better than expected performance across all businesses as we continued to benefit from work, learn, and play from home scenarios. In Windows, overall OEM revenue grew 7%, benefitting from improved supply in April that met unfulfilled Q3 demand. In OEM Pro, this benefit was more than offset by the impact from small and medium businesses in May and June. And in OEM non-Pro, the benefit from work and learn from home scenarios continued but did moderate through the quarter. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 9% and 11% in constant currency, driven by Microsoft 365 and the continued demand for our advanced security solutions. In Surface, revenue grew 28% and 30% in constant currency, with strength across consumer and commercial segments. Search revenue ex TAC declined 18% and 17% in constant currency, driven by the trends noted earlier. And in Gaming, revenue increased 64% and 66% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, with the continued benefit from play-at-home scenarios driving record levels of engagement and monetization across the platform, as well as a significant increase in console sales. Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% and 68% in constant currency, with strong growth in third party transactions, GamePass subscribers, and Minecraft. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 1 point year-over-year with the mix shift to Gaming. Operating expense increased 10%, including the retail stores charge. And operating income grew 15% and 19% in constant currency. Now back to total Company results. In line with expectations, capital expenditures including finance leases were $5.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year to support growing usage and demand for cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $18.7 billion and increased 16% year-over-year driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. And free cash flow was $13.9 billion, up 16%. For the fiscal year, we generated over $60 billion in operating cash flow and over $45 billion in free cash flow, driven by a year of improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses. In other income and expense, interest income, net gains on derivatives, investments, and foreign currency remeasurement were mostly offset by interest expense. Our effective tax rate was slightly below 17%, lower than expected, due to the geographic mix of revenue. And finally, we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 16% year-over-year, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $35 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to update you on a change in accounting estimate to the useful life of server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure. Effective at the start of fiscal year \u201821, we are extending the depreciable life for these assets to four years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2020 as well as future asset purchases. This change will not impact historical depreciation expense, the total depreciation expense over the life of the asset, or cash flow, but it will impact the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets. As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year \u201821 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $900 million in the first quarter and approximately $2.7 billion for the full fiscal year. This has been included in the guidance we will provide on today\u2019s call, and you will find additional details on the mechanics of the change in our earnings materials. Now, let\u2019s move to our next quarter outlook. In our commercial business, given our differentiated position in growth markets, we expect continued commitment to our cloud platform, as well as strong usage and consumption growth. In our consumer business, we expect some continued benefit from work, learn, and play from home scenarios in Gaming and Surface, though at a more moderated rate as stay-at-home guidelines ease in many places around the world. However, we expect the small and medium business weakness we saw in Q4 to continue, which will impact transactional sales, primarily in Office and Windows OEM. In commercial bookings, growth should again be healthy, but will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable and low growth in the Q1 expiry base. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will increase approximately 4 points year-over-year from the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding this impact, continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin percentage will be mostly offset by revenue mix shift to Azure. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter to support the growing usage and demand for our cloud services. Next to FX. Based on current rates, FX should decrease total Company, Productivity and Business Process, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on More Personal Computing revenue, total Company COGS, and operating expense growth. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.65 billion and $11.9 billion. In Office commercial, on a strong prior year comparable, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with continued upsell opportunity to E5. However, growth will be impacted by a decline of approximately 30% in our on-premises business, driven by the transactional weakness in small and medium businesses noted earlier. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year as subscription growth will be offset by a decline in our transactional business. In LinkedIn, we expect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, primarily from weak bookings, and therefore revenue growth, in the Talent Solutions business. And in Dynamics, continued Dynamics 365 momentum from our modern and intelligent solutions will drive revenue growth in the low-double-digits. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $12.55 and $12.8 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will again be driven by our consumption-based business. And in our per-user business, we expect continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though growth will again be impacted by the increasing size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to be up slightly year-over-year, driven by the durable value of our hybrid and premium annuity offerings. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year similar to last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.95 billion and $11.35 billion. In our Windows OEM business, we expect revenue to decline in the low teens range, impacted by the strong prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows 7, as well as the continued slowdown in small and medium businesses. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect healthy double-digit growth from continued Microsoft 365 momentum and the value of our advanced security offerings. In Surface, solid demand against a low prior year comparable that was impacted by product lifecycle transitions should drive growth in the mid teens. In Search ex-TAC, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20% range. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the high teens with continued strong user engagement across the platform. Now back to overall Company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.75 billion to $10.95 billion and operating expense of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion, with continued investment against our significant long-term ambition. Other income and expense should be negative $50 million as interest expense is expected to more than offset interest income. And finally, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than our expected full year rate, given the volume of equity vests in our first quarter. In closing, we are committed to our customer\u2019s success in these challenging times and to managing the Company for long-term growth and profitability. We will continue to expand our cloud infrastructure to support the growing customer usage and demand across our differentiated cloud offerings. And, given our strong execution and growing competitive advantage in high growth areas, we remain committed to investing against the long-term opportunity ahead of us. Now, before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Frank Brod, our Chief Accounting Officer, will soon be retiring. And on behalf of the entire company, thank you for your significant impact and close partnership over the years. You\u2019ve played a key role in our success. And I\u2019d like to welcome Alice Jolla, who has been working alongside Frank and I for many years, as our new Chief Accounting Officer. Alice, we look forward to having you in this position. With that Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A\nMike Spencer: Thanks Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, could you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. Satya, I was hoping if you could help us with your view of what the enterprise spending environment looks like through this difficult period? On one side of the equation, we have very good secular trends that are still very well in place. And like you said, digital transformation is accelerating. On the other side, though, we do have difficult macro conditions out there, and we're seeing it in places like SMB and the like. Can you help us understand how that's putting out on the ground in terms of your customers? Are you still able to get those big deals over the line? And how do you see that playing out through the rest of the fiscal year? Like, how should we think about those impacts through FY21?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for the question. The thing that at least we have learned, I would say in the last five months is that digital technology is no longer viewed as just new project start, but it's becoming perhaps the most key for business resilience, business continuity, obviously is a board level discussion everywhere. But I don't think digital tech as sort of being key to business resilience was the number one priority, whereas now it is. So, I think that's I think -- when I think about digital transformation now, I\u2019d break it into two things. I think about resilience and all sort of what Microsoft can do to help any business be more resilient, whether it's remote everything, whether it's about their ability to simulate anything, automate everything. Those are the things that I think are going to increase. Then of course, there is how do you readjust to what is going to be an increased e-commerce, contactless reimagined world, reconfigured supply chain. So, both of those are secular tailwinds. But no one can take away from sort of the fact that GDP is going to be negative. So, that's why I think you're going to see lots of ins and outs, but digital technology, by -- and digital transformation itself is going to be pretty key. And therefore, we are very-focused on sharpening the value proposition of every part of the stack I described and making sure we are there for our customers as they navigate these tough times.\nAmy Hood: And Keith, maybe just to add to that a little bit. And I think you saw that in our bookings growth for the quarter. And increasingly, I think people will start to focus as well on the remaining performance obligations. And you're starting to see this commitment both, in the next 12 months and then in the 12 months past that. And so, we are obviously -- you'll see some volatility in that from the longer term larger contracts we have talked about. But, we did in Q4 have more of that closed than we anticipated.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nMike Spencer: Thanks Keith. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was just wondering, Satya and Amy, just given the success that you guys have in expanding your footprint with customers, is there any sense that you could feel those kind of -- that some people talk about net expansion rates, right? Just wondering if you guys have a way of helping investors think about kind of the net expansion rate from your existing customers on an annual basis, just given the success you're having with things like Azure hybrid benefits and migrations to the cloud. So, any way for us to help think through that would be really helpful. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Amy, maybe I'll start and then you can add. I mean, the way at least we think about the core, Heather, as far as how we are architecting, what we're doing here, and that's one of the reasons why even I structured my remarks the way I structured them, which is each of these layers is being built, obviously to reinforce the other layer, but each layer is independent, and we recognize that enterprises are very heterogeneous. They're going to choose multiple layers from multiple vendors, and interoperability will be key. But we have a very differentiated value proposition. I mean, even in this quarter, if you think about the number of customers who started with Teams, built a Power application, in fact had Azure, GitHub, Power DevOps on top of that code base, and then used Azure Synapse, all in one solution. So, you can see that power of our stack. So, each layer is architected such that it reinforces the other and we see increasing adoption including, all of these layers. But, I think in the numbers, when we talk about each of the numbers and the growth rates for each of the numbers, that in some sense showcases that. But maybe Amy you want to add more to that.\nAmy Hood: Yes. I think the other way to think about it, Heather, and we do I know talk about it a little bit every quarter. There are two main motions that we focus a lot on here. Number one, are we adding new customers; and number two, are we adding workloads within customers? And I think you'll increasingly hear us talk about the number of customers who are purchasing multiple components of the cloud, whether that's Microsoft 365, Azure and the Power platform Satya just talked about, developer SaaS, or GitHub, and then numerous cloud opportunities within Dynamics 365. So, I think the way I tend to think about it is, is revenue per customer going up? Yes. And are we adding new customers? Yes. And do we feel we still have room to add additional clouds? I think that'll be sort of the language you'll hear us talk through this year.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Amy, cash flow from operations has been an area of concern across the software industry with some companies reporting payment delays, requests for extended payments, et cetera. This quarter, your CFO was a strong standout. What do you think is the reason for the strength? Is this a function of the channel or enterprise exposure or something else? Any data, any information will be appreciated?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Mark. We did have, as you saw -- and we have had very consistent performance in our cash flow from operations. And I think a lot of that, as you've noted, has to do with where that strength is coming from, which is overall it\u2019s cloud billing, it\u2019s usage, it\u2019s consumption-based growth. And we do have, as you noted, a lot exposure to enterprise that has tended to perform quite well. And we did extend, and I mentioned it in our call and our prepared remarks, a lot of financing options to customers as well. So, I feel like we are taking an appropriately balanced approach here and really focusing more on customer enablement. And so, we could see some impacts, but I think the broad portfolio mark and broad geographic exposure probably has benefited us on CFO.\nSatya Nadella: And broadly, we will be very much optimizing for helping our customers through this period and our own share.\nAmy Hood: Yes.\nMark Moerdler: That makes sense. I appreciate. Thank you again.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Amy and Satya, you noticed the strong growth in the E5 SKU around Office 365 over the last year. Can you just talk perhaps a little bit more specifically about how Teams is perhaps changing the discussion around productivity more broadly? How that's maybe raising your profile even more from a strategic perspective as customers start thinking about how sort of collaboration is going to change in this new world, both in the short and the long-term? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Sure, Kirk. The approach we took with Teams always was to not just think of this is chat application, right? I mean, we thought about messaging obviously is important, but we said okay, if you have to reimagine how people communicate using both, chat as well as video, and then most importantly, how people collaborate in meetings, outside meetings before and after. So, that's sort of the second element. And third, think about business process and workflows, dominating inside of this scaffolding of Teams, and then, building it with the theme compliance and security base of Microsoft 365. So, it's absolutely. So, first of all, Microsoft 365 has entered many new categories. They're all part of now Microsoft 365 value. And so, with that -- and the architectural coherence of Microsoft 365, because in some sense, the complexity, security risk, management costs, these are real things for enterprises, especially, if you've got to go remote everything. So, I feel that we have a great value proposition for customers at a time of most acute need where they want to go remote, they need that flexibility when there is hybrid work. And yes, they want the low-cost management and high security and compliance. So, I think we had a differentiated offer there. And I'll turn it to Amy, if you want to add anything to that as well?\nAmy Hood: No. I actually think the other component, Satya, that I would mention is really the transition we've seen from just Office 365 E5 to Microsoft 365 E5 with the entirety of the value proposition. And this I think has been a pivotal year. And again in Q4, we saw even more transition in the SKU mix to the Microsoft 365 SKU than just simply the Office SKU.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Thank you very much for taking the question. And I have one for Satya. I'm curious how you would assess the net impact of the current environment on Azure inclusive of potentially lower consumption growth among highly impacted industries and of course, the per seat moderation in the EMS, offset by some deceleration in digital transformation or broadly among other customers. In addition, I was curious, if you're seeing more pay-as-you-go type arrangements for Azure than you were previously? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Overall, as I said, even in industries that have been impacted, say, economically, one of the things is -- getting to the new efficient frontier of cloud economics is one wing for them to in fact, do better as they get into recovery. So, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing fact, is some acceleration even or getting rid of the old and getting to the efficient frontier, so that then they can recover faster. That doesn't mean that some places where there is absolute real shutdown of economic activity, there isn\u2019t a slowdown. But where people are looking to, say, using even that as an opportunity, come out stronger, we do see that. For sure, pay-as-you-go on Azure is going to be increased and is increasing. And we are fundamentally focused on wherever people want to have these long-term commitments, as well as pay-as-you-go customers. So, we don't in some sense discriminate between the two. What we want to be able to stay focused on is quarter-over-quarter consumption growth by adding value to customers\u2019 digital transformation projects.\nAmy Hood: And I would add, maybe Gregg, a little context. We have been seeing a transition to pay-as-you-go probably for the majority of this year, as opposed to saying it has more recently just emerged as a trend. So, I wanted to make sure to decouple those a teeny bit. And I think in general for us, this quarter, the consumption patterns were very, very similar actually to what we expected, to Satya\u2019s note, with the pressure to I think move to this new frontier, being really at the forefront of people's minds, far more so than maybe a discussion on per user impact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: You\u2019ve continued to show great top line double-digit growth and margin improvement. And many are asking, is that same framework in place in this environment, showing the same double-digit growth with margin improvement, or do things change and you need to invest in new areas that could potentially stall out margins as we go through the cycle?\nSatya Nadella: I'll start and Amy you can add to this. The way I'd say, Brent, is that our focus, especially given that -- what is it, GDP is negative 10 in the world, and you pick your timeframe. Right now, what I would like us to focus on in the interest of our long-term investors is to say how can we build this modern tech stack, so that it can really capture both, help customers transform be resilient and help us get into new categories and build a strong position in those categories. So, my own approach to this would be not to worry as much about short-term, whether it's a growth number, because when you're growing compared to where GDP is healthily, and competitively the growth number is high. I'm not trying to match some artificial double-digit growth number. And nor are we trying to sort of think about a margin target because in some sense, we're -- the world needs to do well for us to do well in the long run. And I think the world will come out of this, and we will be stronger if we invest during this phase.\nAmy Hood: And I just want to reiterate how important that is. The opportunity that Satya really outlined in his remarks is I do believe, fundamental. And so, you see us continuing to invest. You'll see it in capital expenditure based on demand, you'll see it in the operating expense line. And a lot of the margin movement you're going to see is going to be actually far more sales mix than it is to think about it as margins going down in a particular product. So, for me, it's really about in every product, are we investing with a strong position, with a clear view of the future in a way that we can be a more important part of every customer's budget. And so, I think we feel very good about the products we've got, the lineup we've got and the execution engine we've got. And so, I think we're far more focused in that way than maybe on our short term number goal.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions and congrats on the amazing results. Amy, I believe, in your prepared remarks, you said Q4 CapEx was in line with expectations and Q1 should be at a similar level. Can you speak to the evolution in cloud CapEx productivity and utilization trends, your capacity planning process and lead times to stand up incremental capacity? And ultimately, how should we be thinking about the cadence of CapEx going forward?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brad. As you saw, we made great progress this quarter catching up from supply chain challenges that I think we entered the quarter with. And as you can imagine, with the Teams surge and usage, along with other workloads surges, we look forward to continuing to be able to adapt to meet that demand ahead of the curve in addition to what Satya mentioned, which is continuing to enter new regions where we see opportunities. So for me, the way to think about it is you see the cloud revenue growth continuing, you see strong consumption and usage growth, and you should expect cloud CapEx to follow in pretty short order. The lead times there have gotten tighter over time. And so, you can generally think they'll be more correlated, but obviously there's some demand planning that we like to give ourselves ample room.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Sure. Thanks, Brad. Operator, we'll take our last question now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, and congrats as well. A quick one for me. Like, can you talk a little bit about Gaming? So, this quarter was kind of we saw very, very strong numbers. But, before like -- it's slightly weaker because of the tougher comps. But like, how do you think about that cycle of growth that you get out of Gaming? In if we should be getting more stable with more return revenue? Just to talk a little bit about the dynamics a little bit. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Sure, I'll start. I mean, our overall vision is we've been talking about quite frankly multiple years and building out with in particular, our Game Pass strategy. That's what we are going for. This gaming TAM is much more expensive than what we participated in even with all of the success we had with Xbox. So, we think going forward, Xbox, with the approach we're taking has much more of an ability to reach the 2-plus-billion gamers out there. And we're in the early days of building that out. And so, this quarter, of course, was stand out for many of the reasons because of the remote nature of how -- with lot of the activity happened. But -- and also, we have a new console, that's very much part of our strategy. But, we go beyond the console to the PC, we go to mobile, and we have the streaming service. So, all of these accrue to what we think in the long run is going to be a much bigger addressable market. And we have a great structural position. We have a social network in Xbox Live, obviously we have a store that monetizes super well, as well as we have the Game Pass subscription. So, Amy, if you want to add to that?\nAmy Hood: Maybe just a few things, which is when I think about gaming and where we are at this point, the reason it's so exciting I think this quarter reinforces that we have such platform strength built on the view, the support we have of fans at the console. We\u2019ve extended that and begun to extend it to the PC; we're extending it to mobile. That platform strength will drive this more annuity-like behavior that you're thinking about, which is great. And we saw that in the Game Pass subscription growth, again, this quarter building on that base. But then, the third party titles will drive some volatility, but that volatility is just reinforcing of the position we have and I think the long relationship with fans. So, I think we're all pretty excited. I think, Satya called it pivotal, I think, it certainly is and that we're sort of looking forward to the next console release as well.\nRaimoLenschow: Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Take care.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, everyone.\nA - Satya Nadella: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike. We delivered double-digit top line and bottom line growth once again this quarter, driven by the strength of our commercial cloud. As COVID-19 impacts every aspect of our work and life, we have seen 2 years' worth of digital transformation in two months. From remote teamwork and learning to sales and customer service to critical cloud infrastructure and security, we are working alongside customers every day to help them stay open for business in a world of remote everything.  There is both immediate surge demand and systemic structural changes across all of our solution areas that will define the way we live and work going forward. Our diverse portfolio, durable business models, and differentiated technology stack across the cloud and the edge position us well for what's ahead.  And now, I'll highlight our innovation and momentum, starting with modern work. We are empowering people and organizations for a world of secure remote work and learning with Microsoft 365 and Teams. As work norms evolve, organizations are realizing they need a comprehensive solution that brings together communications, collaboration, and business process, built on a foundation of security and privacy. Microsoft Teams supports multiple communications modalities in a shared workspace. It's the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and with the power of Office and business process workflows in a single integrated user experience with the highest security as well as compliance.  Teams keeps all your work and communication, conversations, documents, whiteboards, and meeting notes in context. It helps people collaborate inside and outside meetings, making them more efficient and effective while reducing fatigue. We're accelerating Teams innovation, adding new capabilities each week, and now support meetings of all sizes, meetings that scale from 250 active participants to live events for up to 100,000 attendees to streaming broadcasts.  We saw more than 200 million meeting participants in a single day this month, generating more than 4.1 billion meeting minutes. Teams now has more than 75 million daily active users, engaging in rich forms of communication and collaboration, and two thirds of them shared, collaborated, or interacted with files on Teams. And number of organizations integrating their third-party and Line Of Business apps with Teams has tripled in the past 2 months.  In healthcare alone, there were more than 34 million Teams meetings in the past month. New capabilities enable providers like Northwell Health, New York State's largest health provider to deliver first-class telehealth. And the NHS in the United Kingdom is using Teams to ensure staff have the tools they need to do their vital work.  Now that home offices are doubling as home schools, educational outcomes are at a premium. The combination of Teams and curriculum in OneNote and social learning with Flipgrid gives teachers a complete remote learning solution so that they can improve student outcomes. More than 183,000 educational institutions now rely on Teams. In the United Arab Emirates, more than 350,000 students are using Teams. In Italy, the University of Bologna chose Teams to move 90% of their courses for 80,000 students online in just 3 days.  20 organizations with more than 100,000 employees are now using Teams, including Continental AG, Ernst & Young, Pfizer, and SAP. Just last week, Accenture became the first organization to surpass 0.5 million users, and we expanded our partnership with NFL to include Teams, which powered their first-ever virtual draft.  More broadly, we continue to see momentum with organizations across Microsoft 365. Office 365 now has 258 million paid seats. Usage of Windows Virtual Desktop tripled this quarter as organizations deploy virtual desktops and apps on Azure to enable secure remote work. From Interpublic Group and Cola to Vodafone, the world's leading companies are choosing Microsoft 365 as their productivity cloud. And we continue to see strong demand for our premium offerings from customers like Mastercard, Autodesk, AARP, and Coca-Cola, which chose not only Microsoft 365 but Dynamics 365 and Azure in a 5-year multi-cloud agreement.  We're also expanding our opportunity with consumers with Microsoft 365 Personal and Family, which now has more than 39 million subscribers, and we're bringing Teams to consumers for the first time so that they can stay connected with family and friends.  Windows 10 now has more than 1 billion monthly active devices, up 30% year-over-year, and we are seeing demand for Windows 10 PCs from small screens to large screens to dual screens.  Now on to security. Security remains a strategic priority for every organization, and the shift to remote only increases the need for integrated end-to-end, zero-trust security architecture that reduces both cost and complexity. Third party analysts affirm our leadership as the only company that offers comprehensive identity, security, and compliance solutions. This quarter, we introduced new capabilities to protect customer data no matter where it resides. Microsoft Defender ATP now supports Linux in addition to Windows and macOS with iOS and Android to come soon. A new insider risk management in Microsoft 365 helps organizations detect and mitigate malicious activity.  The world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, is using security services built into Microsoft 365 to protect employees and core services in a zero-trust environment. Retailer ASOS is using Azure Sentinel to detect and mitigate threats, and the need to secure remote identity and access management is increasing demand for Azure Active Directory, now at 300 million active users.  Now on to developer tools. We have the most complete developer tool chain, independent of language, framework or cloud from GitHub to the world's most popular code editing tool, Visual Studio Code. And our developer relevance is increasing. For over a decade, developers have come together remotely on GitHub to build the world's software. As of today, we have 50 million developers on GitHub. From Twilio to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to more than 10,000 engineers at Daimler, GitHub is where developers go from idea to code and code to cloud.  Developers are also collaborating on mission-critical projects from tracking the spread of COVID-19 to implementing contact tracing to helping expand access to personal protective equipment. We are bringing GitHub to even more developers, making core features free for the first time for teams of any size, and our acquisition of npm makes GitHub the largest software repository for JavaScript.  Now on to power platform. COVID-19 has accelerated the urgent need for every business to create no-code/low-code apps and workflows in hours or days, not weeks or months. Power Platform is already used by more than 3.4 million citizen developers and business decision-makers. If you can create an Excel spreadsheet, you can create an app, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow, analyze data, and share insights in real time. In just 2 weeks, Swedish Health Services, the largest nonprofit health provider in the Seattle area, used Power Apps to track critical supplies. Thousands of organizations are relying on new integration between Microsoft Teams and Power Apps to share timely information. And governments around the world are using Power BI to share the latest COVID-19 data with their citizens. Leaders in every industry, from global health care company, GSK, to Coca-Cola to Toyota, are all using Power Platform to accelerate their automation.  Now on to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is helping thousands of organizations accelerate digital transformation as they remote every part of their operations from manufacturing to supply chain management to sales and customer service, inclusive of new scenarios like curbside pickup, contactless shopping, remote customer assistance and operations. Patagonia is using Dynamics 365 Commerce to rapidly move to new, more intelligent distribution and fulfillment models, including contactless shopping. And we are working with card issuers like American Express so merchants who use Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection can reduce fraudulent activity as they process more transactions online.  In field service, the world's largest commercial real estate services firm, CBRE, is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to help keep its life sciences tenants' labs fully operational from afar. And enterprise software company, C3.ai, founded by Tom Siebel, shifted its entire sales force to Dynamics 365 Sales in less than 2 weeks.  Now to LinkedIn. Amidst the changing jobs market, LinkedIn's role in creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce has never been more acute. LinkedIn is where more than 690 million professionals go to connect, learn new skills and find new opportunities, contributing to record levels of engagement across the platform in Q3. We are helping organizations attract, retain and develop talent with our portfolio of Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint and LinkedIn Learning.  Professionals watched nearly 4 million hours of content on LinkedIn Learning in March, a nearly 50% increase month-over-month. With LinkedIn Live, people and organizations can broadcast video content to their networks in real time. Streams are up 158% since February. And the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 gives sales professional tools for more effective remote selling.  Now on to gaming. People everywhere are turning to gaming to sustain human connection while practicing social distancing, and we continue to deliver new, exclusive first- and third-party content to attract and retain gamers. We saw all-time record engagement this quarter, with nearly 19 million active users of Xbox Live, led by the strength on and off-console. Xbox Game Pass has more than 10 million subscribers, and we are seeing increased monetization of in-game content and services. And our Project xCloud gaming service now has hundreds of thousands of users in preview across 7 countries, with 8 more launching in the coming weeks.  Now on to Azure. Now more than ever, organizations are relying on Azure to stay up and running, driving increased usage. We have more data center regions than any other cloud provider. And this quarter, we announced new regions in Mexico as well as in Spain. We are the only cloud that extends to the edge, with consistency across operating models, development environments and infrastructure stack. Now Azure Edge Zones extends Azure to the network edge, connecting directly with the carriers' 5G network to enable immersive real-time experiences that require ultralow latency. And our acquisition of Affirmed Networks will help operators deploy and maintain 5G networks and services cost effectively and securely.  From BlackRock to Coca-Cola to Genesys, leading companies in every industry are choosing Azure. The NBA is using Azure and our AI capabilities to build their own direct-to-consumer experiences, and the world's largest companies like AB InBev and Mars continue to migrate their SAP workloads to our cloud. In AI, customers are applying a comprehensive portfolio of tools and services and infrastructure to address unique challenges, including those created by COVID-19. In health care, we are seeing compute data and AI come together to help speed up response from testing to therapeutics and vaccine development. Health care providers have created more than 1,400 bots using our Healthcare Bot service, helping more than 27 million people access critical health care information.  The Centers for Disease Control is using the Healthcare Bot to help people self-assess for coronavirus symptoms. Adaptive Biotechnologies is using our tools to decode the immune system's response to the virus. And ImmunityBio is using more than 24 petaflops of computing power on our cloud to help researchers build models in days instead of months.  Enterprises are using our speech services to manage a record influx of customer service inquiries, including Poste Italiane, which is using it to automatically respond to nearly 170,000 calls per day. All of 6 million hours of speech were transcribed in March alone. In closing, we will continue to work and innovate alongside our customers as their digital-first responders today and as their trusted digital transformation partners going forward.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Satya discussed, the COVID-19 health crisis is changing the way our employees, customers, partners and communities live and work together. In a new environment, our team addressed surging usage and remote business process adjustments well. Therefore, in Q3, revenue was $35 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency. Operating income increased 25% and 28% in constant currency. Our earnings per share was $1.40, increasing 23% and 27% in constant currency.  Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the quarter. In our consumer business, the landscape evolved quickly following our mid-quarter guidance update. The supply chain in China returned to more normal operations at a faster pace than we had anticipated. And we saw increased demand from work, play and learn-from-home scenarios, benefiting Windows OEM, Surface, Office Consumer and Gaming. This was partially offset by a significant reduction in advertising spend, which impacted our Search and LinkedIn businesses.  In our commercial business in March, we saw healthy Azure consumption and, as Satya mentioned, increased usage across Windows Virtual Desktop, Power Platform and Microsoft 365, particularly in Teams and our advanced security solutions. However, we also saw some changes to our sales dynamics, particularly in the industries and segments most impacted by COVID-19. We saw a slowdown in our transactional business across segments but particularly in small and medium businesses.  In Enterprise Services, growth rates slowed as consulting projects were delayed. And on annual contracts in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, renewals were impacted by the weak job market.  Moving to our overall results. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 12% in constant currency on a relatively small expiration base and strong prior year comparable. Growth was driven by strong renewal execution, consistent with prior quarters, though we saw some impact from the previously mentioned changes in sales dynamics. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24% to $89 billion. Approximately 50% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, in line with prior quarter trends.  Our commercial revenue annuity and mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 92%. And commercial cloud revenue was $13.3 billion, growing 39% and 40% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points year-over-year to 67%. Significant improvement in Azure gross margin percentage, including some benefit from short-term utilization gains as we worked through COVID-19-related supply chain constraints more than offset sales mix shift to Azure.  Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year, driven by favorable segment sales mix and improvement across all 3 of our segments. In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by 1 point and had no impact on operating expense growth. The FX impact on COGS growth was slightly more favorable than expected and reduced growth by 1 point. Operating expense grew 10%, slightly below expectations, primarily driven by lower marketing and travel spend in March. And operating expenses expanded this quarter -- excuse me, operating margins expanded this quarter as a result of higher gross margins and disciplined decisions to invest in strategic and high-growth areas.  Now to our segment results. In line with expectations, revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.7 billion, increasing 15% and 16% in constant currency. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 25% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU with strong upsell to E5. And Office 365 Commercial seats grew 20% to nearly 258 million, with an increasing mix from Microsoft 365.  Office Consumer revenue grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 2019 and Office 365 subscription revenue. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 39.6 million, benefiting from the increased demand noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 47% and 49% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 21% and 22% in constant currency as early quarter momentum was slightly offset by the slowdown in advertising.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in Office 365 and LinkedIn margins more than offset an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expense increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. And operating income increased 20% and 23% in constant currency.  Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $12.3 billion, increasing 27% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 32% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 59% and 61% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business.  In our per user business, our enterprise mobility installed base grew 34% to over 134 million seats, with continued benefit from Microsoft 365. And our on-premises server business grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, driven by the demand for our hybrid and premium solutions and continued benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008. Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency as growth in Premier Support Services more than offset the consulting delays. Segment gross margin dollars increased 30% and 32% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as another quarter of significant improvement in Azure gross margins more than offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expense increased 19%, primarily driven by continued investments in Azure, and operating income grew 42% and 46% in constant currency.  Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11 billion, increasing 3% and 4% in constant currency, ahead of the revised expectations from our mid-quarter guidance update as better-than-expected Windows OEM, Surface and Gaming revenue more than offset lower-than-expected Search revenue. OEM as well as Surface revenue benefited from the improved supply chain in China, increased demand from remote scenarios and continued Windows 7 end of support dynamics. In OEM non-Pro, those dynamics were offset by continued pressure in the entry-level category.  Windows Commercial products and cloud services grew 17% and 18% in constant currency, again driven by Microsoft 365 and demand for our advanced security solutions. Search revenue ex TAC increased 1%, below our expectations, driven by significantly reduced advertising spend. And in Gaming, revenue declined 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by higher user engagement than expected. Xbox's content and services revenue increased 2% on a high prior year comparable with strong growth in Game Pass subscribers and Minecraft.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 6% and 8% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year due to higher-margin sales mix. Operating expense declined 3%, driven by a redeployment of engineering resources to higher growth opportunities. As a result, operating income grew 15% and 17% in constant currency.  Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $3.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year to support growing demand for our cloud services and lower than expected driven by COVID-19-related delays across the supply chain. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $17.5 billion and increased 29% year-over-year, driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. And free cash flow was $13.7 billion, up 25%. Other income and expense was negative $132 million, lower than anticipated due to FX remeasurement and net recognized losses on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize unrealized gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was slightly above 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $9.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33% year-over-year.  Now let's move to our outlook, starting with our expectations for COVID-19-related impact. In our consumer business, we expect continued demand across Windows OEM, Surface and Gaming from the shift to remote work, play and learn from home. Our outlook assumes this benefit remains through much of Q4, though growth rates may be impacted as stay-at-home guidelines ease. We assume advertising spend levels from March do not improve in Q4, which will impact Search and LinkedIn.  In our commercial business, our strong position in durable growth markets means we expect consistent execution on a large annuity base, with continued usage and consumption growth across our cloud offerings. However, we expect the sales dynamics from March to continue, including a significant impact in LinkedIn from the weak job market and increased volatility in new longer lead time deal closures.  In commercial bookings, growth from healthy renewal execution on a larger Q4 expiry base will be impacted by some large commitments in the prior year and the previously mentioned sales dynamics. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively changed year-over-year as continued improvement in IaaS and PaaS gross margin percentage will be more than offset by revenue mix shift to Azure. And with the supply chain constraints easing, we expect a material sequential increase in our capital expenditures to support growing usage and demand for our cloud services.  Next to FX. We expect a larger impact to our results due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Based on current rates, FX should now decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and decrease More Personal Computing revenue growth and total company COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.  Now to segment guidance, which includes wider ranges than normal given the uncertainty in our business with higher in-quarter sales and revenue recognitions. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.65 billion and $11.95 billion. Approximately 80% of this revenue comes from the earnout on existing contracts and agreement renewals. The remaining 20% of revenue, primarily from annuity agreements, transactional licensing and LinkedIn, is subject to more volatility in the current environment.  In Office Commercial, revenue growth will continue to be driven by Office 365, with strong upsell opportunity particularly to our advanced security solutions. However, growth will be partially offset by continued transactional weakness, some impact from the previously mentioned sales dynamics and a strong prior year comparable, where 4 points of growth were from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.  In Office Consumer, we expect low single-digit revenue growth, down sequentially as subscription growth is offset by a slowdown in our Office 2019 transactional business. In LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform. However, a material mix of revenue is driven by customer hiring needs and advertising. Therefore, we expect a significant slowdown to mid-single-digit revenue growth.  In Dynamics, we expect low double-digit revenue growth with continued Dynamics 365 momentum, offset slightly by a slowdown in new projects with longer lead times. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $12.9 billion and $13.15 billion. Approximately 80% of this revenue comes from the earnout on existing annuity contracts, agreement renewals and consumption from existing Azure workloads. The remaining 20%, which is primarily made up of new annuity agreements, transactional licensing and enterprise services consulting revenue, is subject to more volatility.  In Azure, revenue growth will again be driven by our consumption-based business, with continued strong growth across our customer base, though we expect some moderation in the most impacted industries and segments. And in our per user business, growth will be impacted by the increasing size of the installed base as well as the sales dynamic mentioned earlier. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits on a strong prior year comparable as continued hybrid demand is more than offset by some transactional weakness. And in Enterprise Services, we expect a low single-digit revenue decline, driven by continued delays in our consulting business.  In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Roughly 75% of this revenue across OEM, Surface, Search and Gaming is earned in quarter. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be low to mid-single digits on a strong prior year comparable. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with headwinds from our transactional business and the previously mentioned sales dynamics.  In Surface, the continued strong demand should drive revenue growth in the low teens. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20% range, similar to March. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the high teens with continued strong user engagement across the platform.  Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $11.55 billion to $11.75 billion and operating expense of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion. Other income and expense should be negative $100 million as interest expense is expected to more than offset interest income. And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year tax rate of 17% due to the geographic mix of the revenue.  I'd like to close sharing a few thoughts as we look beyond Q4 and into the next fiscal year. Our focus remains on strategically managing the company for the long term, with decisions optimized for delivering greater customer value and long-term financial growth and profitability. With that, we'll continue to provide increased support to our customers and partners as they navigate the uncertain future ahead, deepening our engagement and adding increased value. We will continue to aggressively expand our cloud infrastructure to support not only the usage surges of today but the growing customer demand for our unique and differentiated cloud offerings in the future.  We will continue to make significant investments against the strategic growth opportunities Satya outlined, organically and through strategic acquisitions like that of Affirmed Networks this quarter. And we have the flexibility given our strong financial position and free cash flow generation to do all of this and support our commitment to capital return.  Microsoft does well when our customers do well, and we are uniquely positioned to continue to invest and contribute to their future success.  With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. \nKeith Weiss: Very impressive quarter in a difficult time, and I hope all of you and your families are all safe and healthy. Satya, a question for you. You did a really great job of talking to how well the expanded portfolio, really broad portfolio that Microsoft brings to the market has helped customers during a crisis period and a period that engendered a lot of change within the way organizations were operating. Can you talk to us a little bit about how much of that sort of assistance and how much of that you were able to actually take to revenues, if you will? How much of that is stuff that you could actually monetize today versus given the customer relationship, given the focus on the long term, you have to sort of let play out over time, and it's about kind of expanding usage and expanding the relationships with customers that you expect to pay out over a longer period?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for the question. Overall, the perspective we take, the approach we take is really to be there for our customers at their time of most acute need. So we don't go in there with the mindset of what does it mean for our revenue. I mean this thing that I'd always say which is when our customers do well, we'll do well on a long-term basis, that's at the core of our business model. That's the core of how we approach it.  That said, Keith, I think there are 3 phases here, and there's overlap. For example, the phase we are mostly in right now is that first response space, where from business continuity perspective people want to be able to work remotely, want to be able to conduct remote operations. That's what's leading to increased demand in Teams or increased demand in remote desktop and security and what have you. So that's sort of, I would say, the phase we are in broadly. And of course, there are certain sectors like the health care sector. There is even education obviously as well as some of the public sector organizations. They all have surge demand or even in some segments of retail, where there is surge demand. And so that's something that we are scaling to meet their needs.  Then I believe, as we work out here, so if you think about the next phase of recovery, it's more like a dial. Things will start coming back in terms of economic activity and we'll have to keep adjusting the dial. This hybrid work is going to be there with us for a period of time. That's where some of the sort of architectural product strength of ours will be very useful to our customers. Even just take Teams. It's not -- Teams is not just about having lots and lots of video meetings. Teams is about actually getting work done where meetings and video is one part. So that's, for example, something the utility of it will only increase for our customers as some people come back to work, some people are remote, you have to collaborate without any fatigue. So that's that second phase.  And then the third phase is where there is going to be structural change. There's no turning back, for example, in telemedicine, right? If you look at even what has happened in this first phase with AI bots powering telemedicine triage, that\u2019s going to change, I think, what healthcare outcomes look like. Same thing in education.  Digital twins. This is something I think I talked about maybe in the last earnings even. This is what -- anybody who has a digital twin is able to, first, remote the control plane, is able to automate, is able to simulate. That's huge for anybody who's into manufacturing or is trying to model out and plan their supply chain. So I think that there are ways for us to participate in what ultimately will be productivity growth. But immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity in usage in existing relationships, which all, in the long term, will play out in terms of economics for us as well.\nAmy Hood: And maybe just to add on to that, the way you might think about that, Keith, is the first stage for many of the licensing protocols was to include trial offers for many of our customers who were in need of the specific things we just discussed and, over time being able to convert that into a monetization engine or, for example, to take some of the usage surge we've seen even across our consumer properties or even in gaming or Office 365, which is now Microsoft 365 for consumers. I think there's a lot of opportunity here for us to continue to add value. And when you add value, long-term customer value certainly goes up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Congratulations, Satya and Amy, on the quarter and how you've been able to shift the business over many years to position it so well into these difficult times. We understand there are supply chain issues that have been impacting server deliveries in the quarter, and the changes in demand have been massive. During the quarter, there were disruptions in Azure, Xbox Live, and Teams, we heard. How is Microsoft coping with these sudden demands from work from home? Do you have enough capacity? How quickly can you add capacity? Can you give us a sense of how you deal with that on the Azure and the overall business side?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Maybe I'll start, and Amy, you can add to this. Overall, first, I think I would say the current cloud architecture whether it's at the infrastructure level or the SaaS applications with M365 or Azure have been, I think, very, very helpful in us being able to all as an economy pivot to this new way of working, working from home, remoting all of our operations. If you think about it, like the orders of magnitude increase we've seen in usage, in our own case with our applications such as Teams or Virtual Desktop have been tremendous. And that's happening, as I said, in different segments with our customers as they move to remote operations and are dealing, in some cases, with their own surge demand or what you've seen even in gaming and other entertainment categories. So I would say these architectures withheld well. We did have, as you mentioned, some supply chain issues coming into the quarter, which have largely worked themselves out. But we have a data center architecture and a footprint that really supports our customers' needs for both the elasticity of demand they need but also compliance. So one of the things is data sovereignty and security is not going to go away ever, especially in the geopolitical environment we live in. If anything, it's going to be more important for us to support this need for people to scale while keeping them compliant. And so we feel well positioned for that. With that, I'll transition to Amy to add further.\nAmy Hood: I think, Mark, in many ways, the way you see that capacity show up is in the Q4 CapEx guide. And so while we spent $3.9 billion in Q3, that was certainly short, in particular, on the server side in terms of getting what we need into the data centers. Things got a lot better in March, and they're continuing to get better. And so I feel good that we'll have a healthy CapEx number in Q4 but more importantly continue to get ahead of the surge demand and also there's the continuing demand growth we're seeing across the properties.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I actually had two for you. I was wondering if you could share new logo growth in Azure and Office 365 versus net expansions. Just that there was -- if there's any color you could give on what happened in the quarter. And also, I guess, Satya, how do you think about the adoption curve of Azure and the workloads in the cloud accelerating over the next few years as a result of the changes that may occur from COVID? And any thoughts on if your 3-year out view of cloud adoption is increasing as a result of what's going on?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Maybe, Amy, I'll take the second one first and then you can take the first one. I would say the -- there is no question that moving to the public cloud even at a time like this is just capital efficient. If you think about for any business, the conversations we're having is even for businesses that are having tough economic cycles, one of the smartest things that anyone can do, and we want to be very helpful in those conversations, is to transition to the efficient frontier as quickly as possible so that they can have more agility, more elasticity and better unit economics coming out of this or even while you're in this crisis. So I think the migration to the cloud is absolutely a secular shift.  But at the same time, the architecture of the cloud itself is going to be -- have the cloud and the edge. So it's not just about migrating off-premise, but it's going to be able to have an architecture that supports the needs, where edge compute is increasingly going to be very important. That's why even what we are doing on our edge compute, what we did with Affirmed Networks, what we did with even the launch of Azure Edge Zones, all speaks to, I think, what is going to be the secular infrastructure architecture going forward.\nAmy Hood: And to your first question on really expanding the customer base versus adding seats or consumption within that customer base, we actually saw both this quarter again, the way you would have seen a little bit of weakness, I guess, in on-premises Office Commercial due to transactional weakness and maybe SMB. But outside of that, Heather, it didn't really show a different pattern than I would have normally expected in terms of a breakdown between those.  The one difference I will say is just because there was so much deployment done in the past 4 weeks, especially around Teams and some of the other workloads, there's certainly a distinction that a lot of that was expanding the footprint as opposed of deployment much faster than I think many enterprises had initially planned to do so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Satya, I was curious if you could share on the next chapter of Teams and what you think it looks like, and maybe speak to the monetization halo that you're seeing with the rest of the product line spinning off of the great adoption, which seems to be doubling every time you give us the stats. Thanks for getting our firm up on Teams basically in a couple of weeks.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Brent. Overall, the way we've always approached Teams is as a user experience and, I would say, a scaffolding was to sort of incorporate what's a modern way of working. We always felt that we needed to have, in some sense, best-in-class functionality in each of the modalities, right, whether it's meetings or chat, collaboration or business process. But the most important thing is to bring these together so that people can get more done, teams of people and organizations can get more done. And that's what you see play out even in this pandemic, if you look at it. Of course, there's no question, meetings are most important. We do a lot of them.  But at the same time, what is happening in a meeting is the important context that can't get lost. That's what's going to have continuity, whether it's the whiteboard you created, it's the one note you shared, it's the document you edited together, it's a business process alert that you are responding to. Thinking that through holistically is the most important thing. And that's where our focus will be. In fact, some of the stats I shared even around some of the number of business process applications that are getting integrated, one of the most exciting things to me that happened even in this COVID response, people were able to use Power Platform to build new applications in hours, put that into Teams and then get their first-line workers to be able to track, say, PPE because there was no ERP system that did that. That ability to digitize at high rates and do it in the context of how people work and collaborate, I think, speaks to the power of the Teams platform. And when Teams does well, all of Microsoft 365 does well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhilip Winslow: And I'm glad to hear that you all are well and I hope the same for your families. Satya, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned how Microsoft continues to broaden its relevancy with developers from GitHub, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, dev ops, dev server and most recently, obviously, a multi-cloud infrastructures code with Azure Arc. Just 2 questions on this topic. Firstly, Satya, how do you think about how much of that dev ops life cycle Microsoft needs to address directly versus partnering with third parties or maybe open source? And then secondly, for both Satya and Amy, if COVID-19 is really creating sort of a zeitgeist opportunity for the cloud and digital transformation, how are you seeing your broadening CI/CD pipeline product set impacting Azure's competitive position near and longer term?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. First thing we have always said when we acquired GitHub that we want to be in the developer tools and developer services business as an end, not as a means to some end. And so that's what we're executing on. We care about this. After all, Microsoft was created as a dev tools company first before anything else, and that means a lot to us. And so with GitHub now, we're just really executing on that strategy, which is to start. And that means you have to be true to the developer choices. So this is not about us having anything homogenous from us but to really respect the heterogeneous choices of developers.  All we want to make sure is we bring the very best of our code editing tools to GitHub as the code repository, bring great security capabilities, bring the best of CI/CD and dev ops, bring even live ops, something like Azure PlayFab, all of those tools. But it's not to say that anyone else can't participate. In fact, we have marketplaces on Azure as well as on GitHub. It will be -- it will work across cloud, so we will always ensure that it's an open community that supports all of the developer choices. At the same time, we think of this as -- we're building essentially what we did with Microsoft 365 for knowledge workers and first-line workers. What we are doing with Dynamics 365 for BDMs, we want to do with developers because there are going to be more software developers, and their workflows are going to impact more people outside of software development. So to me, this is a very important SaaS category to be in for its own sake.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hope you guys are staying safe. I wanted to focus on Dynamics. It's obviously not the biggest part of Microsoft, but it's a very important growth one. In this sort of environment where there's a lot of uncertainty, with Dynamics, you're addressing some very fundamental kind of business apps. What do you see there in terms of customer appetite to kind of go for this at this point? Is that kind of an area, because it's now online compared to on-premise, that is seeing more adoption, fast adoption? Or can you talk a little bit about the trends there?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. I think it's actually very important to have the ability in a very agile way as a business to be able to move on your business process needs. So for example, if you're a retailer and you now need to do contactless shopping, that is something that, for example, Dynamics is going to support for you to be able to use even commodity cameras with AI modules, with all of it helping with a data model that supports shopping inside of physical stores or curbside pickup or even remote assistance. These are some of the examples I even used in my script.  So this is what is sort of going to be high priority. So as long as business applications like ours with Dynamics 365 address the immediate pressing needs, these are project starts that will happen because, in some sense, that's the way for economic activity to return. But at the same time, I think business applications that perhaps are -- have longer lead in terms of implementation, people are probably going to take some more time to decide on it. But whereas we think we are well positioned to capture the new scenarios. And Power Apps, because we think about Power Platform and Dynamics as both what we do with business applications, and we feel that between these two, along with Azure, are well positioned to address what are going to be increasing digitization needs, where people don't have months to deploy or months to implement. And that's where we shine.\nAmy Hood: And I think that you would say that we've seen that in our pipeline and really in the customer demand scenarios. So I think what we've seen is really more of a shift to some of these quick time-to-value deployments and a real change in terms of new, long lead time projects there, and I think that's probably not surprising.\nSatya Nadella: And the one thing -- one scenario I should mention is, for anyone who's looking to say, \"How do I continue to generate revenue?\" Remote sales, for example, is going to be a very critical scenario. And there's no better solution than the combination of Dynamics Sales and LinkedIn Sales Navigator to be able to drive especially B2B sales. So those are the types of solutions that are going to be very relevant in times like this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: I'm interested in whether you see the current environment as a net tailwind or a net headwind on Azure growth, just as we try to weigh the idea of the pandemic as a forcing function to adopt cloud a little more rapidly versus, on the other hand, potential economic pressure on IT budgets. How do you think that, that balances out for bookings and for consumption?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, and Amy, you can add to it. There are, as you said, many different ins and outs here. But if you step back and ask yourself, say, 2 years from now, \"Is there going to be more being done in the public cloud or hybrid cloud or less?\" The answer is more, just because it is more efficient. It is the only way for you to have even the business continuity required in times like this, and your needs going forward of increasing digitization are going to be met with better pricing, better economics at a unit price level for the given business. So that's sort of what we use to forecast out what we commit, both in terms of CapEx, OpEx, innovation and customer engagement.  To your point, ultimately, Microsoft's not immune from what's happening broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth. But at the same time, if there is going to be economic activity, then I would claim that digital as a component of that economic activity is going to increase. And specifically, the full stack we have from infrastructure to our SaaS applications are going to be very competitive in that context.\nAmy Hood: And I think for me, we -- it's so clear. I think we talk about our capital investment or our world view, that it's a tailwind over any long period of time. Satya talked about two years or three years for sure. And I think the way you're seeing it in something like bookings, for example, would be, maybe you don't make as large of a giant commitment, and you're more willing to do pay as you go as you just think about making that transition when you don't want to have a giant budget conversation with your department but you'd rather move to an easier use and pay in the moment. And I think in some ways, that will be the same thing that we were already seeing, is a transition in terms of thinking about that for long term. And so it will have some impact as big deals always did or didn't on bookings. And so I would keep that in mind. But other than that, I think obviously over any longer period of time, it's certainly a tailwind.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets.\nAleksandr Zukin: And glad to hear you're staying safe. Satya, given the incredible spike you're seeing in Teams and broader Office adoption around remote work, I guess maybe first, given how this crisis has dramatically accelerated some of these adoption curves, how do you think about the longer-term growth and monetization trajectory on Teams and Office maybe versus pre-COVID levels? And then if you think about your competitive positioning, having both the opportunity to solve remote work challenges from a productivity standpoint and infrastructure challenges from an Azure standpoint, how does the combination of those change some of the competitive dynamics in the market right now?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you for that question. First of all, as I said a little earlier, Teams and the usage of Teams is something that increases the intensity across all of what's Microsoft 365. And to your point about whether it's -- and usage leads to monetization. Now for example, one of the things that we didn't talk as much at least in the Q&A section is on security. If you look at one of the key considerations, as people go remote work, is to ensure, starting with the identity, to the device endpoint, to the application, to the information in the application and the infrastructure behind the app, you need that zero-trust architecture. So that's, again, built in to and in around Teams itself.  So to me, we have -- and same thing with compliance, right? So it's one thing to have Teams, people working remotely. But information being shared in Teams, that one note you share, does it carry the policies that were set for information protection? See, that's the big advantage we have architecturally in terms of all this having been built with one particular set of architectural principles so that they can be enforced throughout all of these applications. And we'll obviously want to monetize these as appropriate at different levels of subscription we have for M365. And so we feel well positioned on that.  And to your second part, we've always said this, which is we don't, for example, even allocate our capital in building out our cloud infrastructure for Azure or Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365 or even, for that matter, xCloud all as separate. We think of this as all being built on one common platform in Azure. And that's where our fundamental capital efficiency of that architecture comes from. And yes, from a customer end perspective, we absolutely want to win each layer based on its own merits, and we will have openness in each layer.  But there are great benefits. And Coca-Cola and the deal this quarter is a great example of someone who wants to use, in fact, our security across all these 3 clouds and the products across all these 3 clouds. So that's what we will increasingly do, but that also means we want to be competitive in each layer and open in each layer.\nAmy Hood: And maybe to add that I think in some ways speaks in Alex's question goes back to the very beginning of how we feel the value sits in that Microsoft 365. But even more broadly is that while we've seen a surge in Teams now, there was a lot of surging in security and compliance 6 months ago and 6 months before that. We've seen increased usage across multiple products in our line and that includes Windows and the PC. And so this very holistic and broad commercial opportunity, but also that extends, in many ways, to consumer opportunities for us as well, is connected. And that breadth, in a moment and a period like this, all the pieces are important to value long term here to a company being able to transition through the phases that Satya talked about, from this initial phase of almost emergency response to a hybrid phase to ultimately what I think we all believe is a very different way and a long-term way of working and collaborating together and driving a digital economy. So I think in some ways, the breadth of this company and where we've invested over the past few years, it's not just Teams but maybe a few products that have served us well and served our customers well.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all. Thank you and stay safe.\nAmy Hood: Stay safe. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

It was another strong quarter with double-digit top and bottom line growth driven by the strength of our commercial cloud. Stepping back from the quarter and reflecting more broadly on the next decade, the defining secular trend will be the increasing rate of digitization of people, places, and things. This malleable power of software will drive productivity growth across all industries, leading to more inclusive economic growth far beyond the domains of consumer tech today. Tech spend as a percentage of GDP is projected to double over the next decade. At Microsoft, we are focused on building the most differentiated tech stack to enable every organization in every industry to build their own digital capability and tech intensity, with a business model that is trusted and aligned with their success in this new era. Now, I'll briefly highlight our innovation momentum, starting with Azure. Every customer will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to power their mission-critical workloads and meet regulatory as well as operational solvency needs. We have more data center regions than any other cloud provider and will be the first to open in Israel and Qatar, expanding our footprint to 56 in total. Azure is the only cloud that offers consistency across operating models, development environments, and infrastructure stack, enabling customers to bring cloud compute and intelligence to any connected or disconnected environment. This quarter, we expanded our portfolio of edge appliances. Azure Stack Edge brings rapid machine learning inferencing closer to where data is generated and the new ruggedized Azure Stack form factors provide cloud capabilities in even the harshest of conditions like disaster response. With Azure Arc, we are defining the next generation of hybrid computing. Arc is an industry-first control plane built for a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, helping partners like HPE meet their customers' complex hybrid needs. Our differentiated approach across the cloud and edge is winning customers. The U.S. Department of Defense chose Azure to support our men and women in uniform at home, abroad, and at their tactical edge. And our exclusive partnership with SAP makes Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer with large migrations in every industry from Accenture to Coca-Cola to Rio Tinto to Walgreens Boots Alliance. We're also going beyond conventional computing architecture ushering in a new era with Azure Quantum, a full stack open ecosystem that enables customers like Ford Motor Company to apply the power of quantum computing today. There will be 175 zettabytes of data by 2025, up from 40 zettabytes today. Processing this data in real-time will be an operational imperative for every organization. Azure Synapse is our limitless analytics service. It brings together big data analytics and data warehousing with unmatched performance, scale, and security. In concert with Power BI, it enables data scientists to generate immediate insights from structured and unstructured data and build custom AI models. Walgreens Boots Alliance is using Synapse to analyze more than 200 million item-store combination, so millions of customers can rely on items always being in stock. In AI, we are seeing rapid adoption across our comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure, and services. 6 billion transactions on Azure Cognitive Services each month, 7 billion documents processed daily with Azure Cognitive Search, 2 billion predictions a month using Azure Machine Learning, and 3,500 new conversational agent bots created each week with Azure Bot Service. Nationwide is using Azure Bot Service to simplify how millions of customers submit claims, and KPMG is using Azure Cognitive Services to transcribe and catalog thousands of hours of calls reducing compliance costs for its clients by as much as 80%. Now to security, Cybercrime will cost businesses, governments, and individuals $1 trillion this year. We are the only company that offers integrated end-to-end identity, security, and compliance solutions to protect people and organizations, spanning identity management, devices, cloud apps, data, and infrastructure. Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership and strong structural position and customers from Maersk to Vodafone are increasingly turning to us to simplify security integration and speed their responses to issues. Four months since launch, more than 3,500 customers already rely on Azure Sentinel to detect and mitigate threats. It's early days and we are accelerating our investments. Now on to developer tools. From Azure DevOps to Visual Studio to GitHub, we offer the most complete developer tool chain, independent of language, framework, or cloud. New capabilities make it easier for any developer to go from idea to code and from code to cloud. Developers can collaborate on the go with new GitHub mobile app, and GitHub Security Lab addresses the important need to keep open source software secure. More than 10,000 developers at Adobe are using GitHub to collaborate and create software. Stripe is using GitHub to build the online payment platform of choice for millions of customers, and Chipotle is using our dev tools to power their online ordering system. Now on to Power platform. We are empowering not only professional developers, but those closest to the business problem from citizen developers to businesses -- business decision-makers with no-code, low-code tools so they can create apps and intelligent workflows that solve unique needs. Today, 2.6 million citizen developers use Power platform to make better decisions using self-service analytics, building mobile app, automate a business process, or even create a virtual agent all with no coding experience. We're innovating in robotic process automation, Power Automate enables customers to turn manual tasks into automated workflows, and Power Virtual Agents enables anyone to build an intelligent bot with just point and click. TruGreen, the largest lawn care company in the United States is using both these solutions to handle customer inquiries and take action. Now on to Dynamics 365. The competitiveness of every business going forward will be defined by their ability to harness the full value of their data. Dynamics 365 enables organizations to move from reactive siloed transactional processes to proactive, repeatable, and predictable business outcomes. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights that's layered and built on Azure Synapse is the only customer data platform operating at scale today. AEP Energy is using it to unify first and third-party customer data to increase, upsell, and reduce churn. In retail, Canada Goose is using Dynamics 365 Commerce to unify data across back-office, in-store, and call centers to deliver more personalized shopping experiences. And in training, ABB is using Dynamics 365 Guides and Remote Assisted to bridge the physical and digital world. And Qantas is using HoloLens 2 for immersive new training experiences. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Every seven seconds, someone is hired on LinkedIn. We saw record levels of member engagement again this quarter. Marketing solutions remains our fastest growing business as marketers leverage the enhanced tools and LinkedIn pages to connect with our nearly 675 million members. New data validation features in LinkedIn Sales Navigator helps sellers use the power of their LinkedIn network to drive more meaningful customer engagement. We continue to innovate across our talent portfolio, including talent solutions, Talent Insights, Glint and LinkedIn Learning to help organizations attract, retain and develop the best talent. More than five million members have already completed LinkedIn skills assessment since the launch last quarter. Now turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the only solution that empowers everyone with an integrated secure experience on any device. Every day, AI and Microsoft 365 is helping create, collaborate and convert content into knowledge in a world where computing is abundant, however, attention is scarce. Presentations are more persuasive in PowerPoint, data is more insightful in Excel, videos are more searchable in stream and e-mail more actionable with Cortana. The new project Cortex analyzes massive amounts of information to give people precisely the knowledge they need in the context of their work. And the new Microsoft Edge with enterprise class security protects your privacy online and makes it easier to find information at your work with Microsoft Search. Microsoft Teams is the leading hub for teamwork. Now with more than 20 million daily active users, people are increasingly engaged across the platform in richer forms of communication and collaboration, participating in more than 27 million meetings a month. Integrated calendaring, pop-out chats and one-touch to join meetings from your phone keeps work, conversations and meetings in the context, eliminating the need to bounce back and forth between apps. We are reimagining the meeting rooms of the future with Teams integration with Cisco's Webex and new devices from Lenovo. And our partnership with Samsung, along with the new walkie-talkie feature in Teams gives first-line workers the technology they need to be more collaborative, productive and secure on-the-go. All this innovation is driving usage. 64,000 employees at L'Or\u00e9al are using Teams. More than 70,000 first-line employees at IKEA are moving to Teams for shift management. From Nestl\u00e9 to Tesco, the world's largest companies are choosing Microsoft 365, and we continue to see increased demand for our premium offerings from customers like AXA, Rockwell Automation, Berkshire Hathaway, Specialty Insurance and Duracell. This holiday, we expanded our family of Surface devices, creating new categories that benefit the entire OEM ecosystem. And at CES, our partners showcased innovative Windows 10 devices from incredibly thin and light laptops to powerful gaming rigs to new dual-screen designs. Finally, gaming. We continue to invest to reach gamers across every endpoint, mobile, PC and console. xCloud is off to a very strong start, transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed with hundreds of thousands of people participating in initial trials. We set a new record for Xbox Live monthly active users again this quarter, led by the strength of console. Xbox Game Pass subscribers more than doubled this quarter, and Xbox Series X announced last month will be our most powerful console ever. In closing, we are expanding our opportunity across all our businesses. Along with this opportunity, we recognize the responsibility we have to ensure the technology we build is always inclusive, trusted and is creating more sustainable work. Our customers see this urgent need and are looking to us in partnership with them to take action. That's why we announced an ambitious new sustainability commitment. Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2030. And by 2050, we will remove all the carbon we have emitted since the company was founded in 1975. And our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund will accelerate the development of carbon reduction and removal technologies. We will continue to innovate alongside customers with profitable, sustainable solutions that expand our opportunity. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $36.9 billion, up 14% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 22% and 25% in constant currency. Operating income increased 35% and 39% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.51, increasing 37% and 41% in constant currency, when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA from the prior year. Our sales teams and partners again delivered strong commercial results, and we continue to benefit from favorable secular trends. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across all markets. In our commercial business, we continued to see strong demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings with increased customer commitment to the Azure platform. And the unique value of Microsoft 365 bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and enterprise mobility and security, as a secure intelligent solution, again drove adoption by both new and existing customers. As a result, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 31% and 30% in constant currency, with a high volume of new business and strong renewal execution. Our commercial remaining performance obligation was $90 billion, up 30% year-over-year, driven by long-term customer commitments. Commercial cloud revenue was $12.5 billion, growing 39% and 41% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased five points year-over-year to 67%, driven again by material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage, which more than offset sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 67%, up five points year-over-year driven by favorable sales mix and improvement across all three of our segments. In the quarter, gross margin percentage benefited from lower console sales, stronger than expected software licensing results and improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage. In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by one point and had no impact on operating expense growth. FX impact on COGS growth was slightly more favorable than expected and reduced growth by one point. Operating expense grew 9%, slightly below expectations, primarily driven by lower program spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter as a result of higher gross margins and operating leverage through disciplined decisions to invest in strategic and high growth areas. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion, increasing 17% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both our commercial and consumer businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 16% and 18% in constant currency with roughly three points of on-premises benefit, primarily from transactional strength in Japan. Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 27% and 30% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Office 365 commercial seats grew 21% with an increasing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite. Office consumer revenue grew 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue. This quarter, growth was also impacted by roughly seven points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan and five points of benefit from the low prior year comparable related to the timing of the Office 2019 purchases. Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 37.2 million. Dynamics revenue grew 12% and 15% in constant currency. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 42% and 45% in constant currency, with continued momentum in the number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads. LinkedIn revenue increased 24% and 26% in constant currency, with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 25% with record levels of engagement again this quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased two points year-over-year as improvements in Office 365 and LinkedIn margins more than offset, an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expense increased 12%, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. And operating income increased 29% and 33% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.9 billion, increasing 27% and 28% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 32% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 62% and 64% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments. In our per user business, our enterprise mobility installed base grew 35% to over 127 million seats, with continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 10% and 12% in constant currency, with roughly four points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, in addition to the continued strength of our hybrid and premium solutions. Nearly one-third of our Windows Server and SQL Server enterprise customers are already using our hybrid use benefits to deploy Azure, reflecting the value and flexibility of these offerings. Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 31% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased one point year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin more than offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expense increased 18%, primarily driven by continued investments in Azure. Operating income grew 38% and 42% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.2 billion, increasing 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance across our Windows businesses more than offset lower-than-expected search and surface revenue. In Windows, overall PC market growth was stronger than we expected and benefited from the low prior year comparable related to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners. OEM Pro revenue, which makes up roughly 40% of total Windows revenue, grew 26%, driven by continued momentum in advance of Windows 7 end of support and strong Windows 10 demand. The benefit from the low prior year comparable drove roughly 11 points of that growth. OEM non-Pro revenue, which makes up roughly 20% of total Windows revenue, increased 4%. This quarter, continued pressure in the entry-level category was more than offset by roughly seven points of benefit from the low prior year comparable and the timing of license purchases from an OEM partner. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue, which makes up roughly 30% of total Windows revenue, grew 25% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by strong demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition. The remainder of the Windows business is made up of our other licensing and services components. Surface revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency, lower-than-expected as continued strong momentum in the commercial segment was partially offset by execution challenges in the consumer segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations, primarily driven by lower Bing volume. And in gaming, revenue declined 21% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by lower console sales as we approach the next Xbox launch. Xbox content and services revenue declined 11% and 9% in constant currency as the impact from a strong third-party title in the prior year more than offset continued growth in Game Pass subscribers and Minecraft. Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased seven points year-over-year due to higher-margin sales mix. Operating expense declined 5% as redeployment of engineering resources to higher-growth opportunities was partially offset by gaming investments, primarily in first-party content. As a result, operating income grew 41% and 45% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. In line with expectations, capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by an ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $10.7 billion and increased 20% year-over-year, driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $7.1 billion and increased 37%, reflecting the timing of cash payments for PP&E. Other income was $194 million higher than anticipated due to the recording of mark-to-market gains in our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was slightly above 17%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, let's move to our outlook. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue at both the company and individual segment level by approximately one point and have no impact on total company COGS and operating expense growth. In our commercial business, we expect consistent execution and continued demand for our hybrid solutions to drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy, but will be impacted by a materially lower growth in our Q3 ex-rebase. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve year-over-year, although at a lower rate than last quarter given the growing mix of Azure consumption-based services. And we expect a sequential dollar increase in our capital expenditure as we continue to invest to support growing demand. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.5 billion and $11.7 billion, driven by continued double-digit growth across Office Commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.85 billion and $12.05 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect the balance of our strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per user business, given the size of the installed base. Growth in our on-premise server business should be high single digits, again driven by strong hybrid demand as well as some continued benefit related to the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be slightly higher than last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion. In Windows, overall, OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single-digits and continue to reflect healthy Windows 10 demand, end of support for Windows 7, and the supply chain's ability to meet demand. The wider-than-usual range in More Personal Computing segment reflects uncertainty related to the public health situation in China. In Windows, Commercial Products and Cloud Services, we expect another quarter of healthy double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued Microsoft 365 suite momentum and some benefit from Windows 7 extended support agreements. In Surface, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits as we work through the execution challenges in the consumer segment. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q2. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low double-digit range, driven by the continuation of the console trend as we near the launch of Xbox Series X as well as lower transaction volume on a third-party title. Now, back to the overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $11.05 billion to $11.25 billion and operating expense of $11.2 billion to $11.3 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be slightly below our full year rate of 17% due to the timing of equity vests. Now, let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth, driven by the continued strength of our commercial business. For operating expense, as a result of lower spend in H1, we now expect full year growth between 10% and 11%. And finally, given our strong H1 results, particularly in high margin businesses, as well as the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up roughly two points year-over-year, even as we invest with significant ambition in strategic and high-growth areas in the second half of this year. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. As respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations on a really strong [technical difficulty]. I'd like to look at Azure. Can you give a little bit of more details on what's driving the Q-over-Q acceleration in the revenue growth? Are we seeing large contracts starting to ramp? Are there other factors that are kicking in that are helping that? And Satya, can you also give us some sense of what you think about the impact if xCloud is accessible on Azure. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Thanks Mark for the question. I think, overall, in terms of the Azure momentum, it's sort of the thing that we have seen even in the previous quarters so, which is we have a stack that is from infrastructure to the PaaS services, that's fairly differentiated. I mean, I went through some of the things that we even announced at our Ignite conference. Take something like Azure Arc. The fact that we have a control plane for hybrid computing that is multi-cloud, multi-edge, that's a pretty differentiated aspect of it. And the data side, both on the transactions, on the OLTP side as well as on the analytics side, we now have cloud-native databases, and Azure Synapse, I think, is a very competitive product. So that's what you see play out in terms of a customer adoption and the growth there. xCloud, I think, is a great workload. I mean, we\u2019ve always had the mantra of first party equals third party, whether it is any of the workloads internally, it is really helping us understand the new patterns, which then of course third parties can use. And you can see that even in terms of how Sony will use some of the same infrastructure capabilities. So, we are excited about what xCloud teaches us, but more importantly, we're excited about how others in the ecosystem can use the same capability for their streaming needs.\nAmy Hood: And, Mark, to your question on -- a little bit about the reacceleration in the Azure growth rate, let me divide that into its components. We did have a very good and healthy, broad-based consumption growth, especially in IaaS and PaaS. I think, actually, Satya touched on one of the important parts that we started to see this quarter was not only good workload migration work, strong growth in the optimization of the workloads already running, but also some of these new PaaS workloads like Synapse and Cosmos DB and Arc are really starting to add some momentum in that part of the stack as well, which is important. The SaaS component or the per-user component also tends to be where you'll get some variability as well. We did have a good SaaS component quarter in addition to the healthy base, and that does result in some movement in that number from quarter-to-quarter. And in particular, I think Microsoft 365 suite actually, and the momentum we've got in security and management and mobility is a big contributor to that. And of course, just the type of contracts that get signed, whether that's for the consumption layer, in particular, can have some impact quarter to quarter in a couple of points. So, there will be some variability in that number, but the underlying fundamentals across both the consumption and per user were quite good.\nMark Moerdler: Perfect. I really do appreciate. Thank you, and again congrats.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith Weiss, your line is live. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Sorry, guys, I was on mute. Thanks for taking the question, and a very, very nice quarter. Coming out of the Ignite conference, I wanted to sort of get your views on progress with developers broadly, particularly after the GitHub acquisition. Can you talk to us a little bit about how that's kind of impacted your traction with stuff like DevOps Studio and your Developer Tools? And also, how that's kind of changed the dynamic around Azure? Has that become a real competitive differentiation and changed at all the competitive dynamic with guys like AWS and GCP out there in the marketplace?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the question. We are very, very excited about what's happening with the developer offering. I mean, at some level, I think of what we're doing between Visual Studio and Azure DevOps and GitHub as effectively coming together as a compelling developer SaaS solution in the same class as any other SaaS solution from Microsoft around productivity and communication, because as one of the data points I love to use is the number of developers in the non-tech sector is now more than in the tech sector. This is software engineers and that's going to only increase in the world going forward. So we want to build the best tool chain. After all, that's who we are as a company. We love building tools for developers. And so -- and by the way, we're not focused only on Azure. For developers who use our tool chains, they can target any cloud, any edge device, and so this is not sort of means to some end. We've always been clear about it. It's an end to itself. But that said, of course, having this tool chain will help us overall, both with essentially what is, by itself, high-margin tools as a SaaS business as well as, of course, developers who are going to be in our ecosystem. But we want to stay true to that ethos of open source, GitHub and do the best tools. In fact, just this last quarter, you saw even some of the tools being adopted by Facebook engineering and that's, I think, a testament to the progress that's been made by Microsoft.\nAmy Hood: And I would just add to that, Keith, this is an important area for us to continue to invest in. The opportunity Satya talked about is at the developer SaaS level. And so whether you see us investing in GitHub or in the Azure tool chain, this will be a place that we'll continue to see as an opportunity for growth.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Great. Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll move to next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks. Amy, I'd love to ask you a gross margin question. Beginning in your third quarter or the current March quarter, we've been bracing for gross margins to trend flat or even down year-over-year, given the sales mix shifts that you and your IR team have long warned us about. Yet when I take your Revs guide and your COGS guide, it equates to 3Q gross margins of 68%, which are actually up about 150 bps year-over-year. So I just wanted to understand what's going on. Is it that the higher gross margin businesses are decelerating at a slower than expected pace in your second half? Or perhaps the pace of Azure gross margin improvement is greater than you thought? A little color there might be helpful.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Really, when you see the gross margin changes, it all comes down to sales mix. So at a fundamental level, I feel very good about the execution of each service to their -- own gross margin goals. We saw improvement across every cloud service, not just Azure in terms of their ability to deliver growing gross margin as they focus not only on cost, but also on continuing to see ARPU growth and attach growth. So -- and I could say that about many of the product lines, right? I focus on them at the -- what can each products line do to be its best and most competitive? What you saw in H1 and what you'll see in H2 is simply mix in Q2. There was a lot of mix into Windows away from, for example, the console, right, since we're heading into the next console cycle. At a company level, if you thought about what gross margins would have looked like without gaming, it's a couple of points of impact. And as we head to H2, what you'll see is that, the mix will shift a little bit. The sort of end of support impacts tail off, whether that's in OEM or on the server side. And the contribution from gaming as well as other components in our hardware portfolio go up a little bit. So that still does result, as you said, in a higher gross margin implication in Q3, and you'll see that continue to have a slightly different impact as we head into Q4, if that helps to give you a little sense.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Thanks Amy.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, thanks Karl. Operator we\u2019ll take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: I just wanted to follow up on a little bit what Karl was just asking relating to gross margins. I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about the mix between PaaS and IaaS and kind of what -- if you can give us a sense of the mix shift or just kind of how that's been trending? But also, I wanted to ask about -- you've been -- it's been unbelievable, every quarter, you're able to call out material gross margin improvements in Azure. And I guess ultimately, what I'm asking is, given the success you've seen there, has your view for -- if you look 2 to 3 years down the road, do you just think Azure is going to be a higher gross margin business than maybe what you would have thought 3 years ago?\nAmy Hood: Specifically on Azure, I think the Azure gross margins are trending where we thought they would trend actually on the IaaS and PaaS layer. And they're trending where we thought they would trend on the per user-like assets. And what you're seeing is continued improvement on that trend line that we expected. But you'll also see as we go forward in time, those improvements will flow at the IaaS and PaaS layer. It will get better but the nature and the rate of improvement will flow. And you'll see that increasing mix toward IaaS and PaaS in a way from the per user just as in terms of the opportunity and the TAM. So for the long run, Heather, I think my view is unchanged, frankly, about what that should look like. And, of course, over the same time period, how it would impact commercial cloud gross margins all up. But what -- I think if you separate this from this gross margin implication, it goes to the fact of just how much revenue opportunity exists in cloud. And so if we can continue to capture the revenue growth, continue to meet customer needs and scenarios, pick and thoughtfully invest in industry level solutions to grow those things, I worry less about the mechanics of the GM, which can continue to improve by service and more really about our opportunity to grow revenue.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah, and I would say when we think about whether it's our R&D and operating leverage there or sales or CapEx for the cloud, we don't separate out these categories of IaaS, PaaS and even SaaS. I mean, just to put it practically for you, we might do an infrastructure service around IoT. We then have PaaS services around IoT. We have apps around IoT and Dynamics 365. Similarly, we have the xCloud and Game Pass subscriptions and we have the streaming capability in Azure. So we think about our investments holistically in that sense, and I think that's what's going to define the long-term margin profile of our company is how well we manage all layers and collectively get leverage across the investment.\nHeather Bellini: Very helpful. Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Heather. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Amy, you called out the strength of on-premise software. I'm just curious; I know you have the tailwind from the expiration. But maybe talk through some of the other drivers that you're seeing in the business that's causing such great growth even on the on-premise as the cloud continues to grow?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. What we've seen has been relatively consistent is the drivers on the on-prem side have absolutely been the hybrid value prop and also premium. And they're actually related because ultimately, the really things that we've seen that has value for customers is that flexibility, and so the flexibility to deploy where they need it and when they need it. And if that makes sense on the edge, which some people may call on-prem, and whether that makes sense in the cloud, which people may call Azure were relatively indifferent as long as it meets the customer solution in the way that the solution demands. And so that hybrid value prop, you start to see that flexibility in the data point I gave, which is that one-third of the Windows and SQL Server customers are already starting to use that right to be able to take advantage of that flexibility for their workload solutions. And so those trends, I see is relatively durable. And that's why we talked about, I think, now for a number of years. And I think if we think about the end of support and the tail on that, it was probably two points on IC for the quarter as I called out. So, I feel very good about the underlying trajectory.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we\u2019ll move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you. Satya, a few quarters ago, you had commented that Teams is the fastest growing app in the company's history. Wondering if you could clarify, if that is a reference to daily active user growth or bookings impact? Or is that a comment on user engagement and the time being spent in Teams or some other criteria? As well, Amy, wondering if you could offer any kind of directional thoughts on just how to model the Windows OEM line, post-Windows 7 end of support and going into fiscal year 2021. And any high-level thoughts on how you think that could trend versus what happened in the prior cycle?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, thanks for the question, Mark. My comment was mostly around deployment engagement, the depth of engagement. There are very few types of products which have these platform effects. Teams is a scaffolding that is obviously related to messaging, which has significant usage. It's also driving usage of the rest of office, because rest of office gets integrated in the usage patterns around channels. It's obviously used in meetings. It's also the place where business process workflows in context of messaging happen and both for knowledge workers and first-line workers. So when I look at all of that cumulative effect, it's much broader than any other user experience scaffolding and in terms of its ability to drive that type of platform effect and engagement. So we're excited about it. And we continue to see that, and you saw that in my remarks as well.\nAmy Hood: And to your question on OEM, I think what's important is if you try to take out, which is challenging, some of the comments we've had on either chip supply constraints or some of the uncertainty related to the public health situation in China, you would say, what we have in terms of what the cycle would look like compared to prior cycle ends, would actually be quite similar. If not, we probably have a little more opportunity in the mid and small business segment to have the tail last a little longer probably than it did the last time. So we feel very good. We'll still need to work through that as we work through both the situations I've talked about, frankly, now for quite a few quarters and then looking forward. So we'll continue to give you guidance on what we see in the market each quarter.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we\u2019ll take next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Amy, you mentioned a couple of times this evening about one-third of customers using hybrid rights. Within that customer base, any sense of what percent of workloads that represents for those clients? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Brad, there's not really a good way for me to know that. For me, the way I think about this is a top of funnel. It means that we've got solutions or workloads, where all the corporate developers that Satya mentioned are really starting to make that transition and making decisions for themselves about how to use Azure and how to get to experience it. For me, that is a great sign. We've always said a lot of these hybrid use rights were about investing in skilling and learning and teaching the environment and having the adoption happen for the workloads that make the most sense. And then we can continue to partner with customers to help them through this process and continue to have more meaningful workload transition. So for us, I think I tend to start at the top and say, if we've got more going into the funnel, more opportunities to partner with customers, that's a good thing.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we\u2019ll take our last questioner, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on dynamics. I guess a question for Amy and Satya. I mean, Amy, you called out both seat growth but also increasing attach to multiple products with the Dynamics driving that growth rate. Wondering if you could help us sort of parse that out. And then to Satya, when you think about just SaaS in general, how important is sort of Dynamics to the overall Microsoft strategy, particularly with what you're trying to do with the AI platform in Azure because, obviously, over the past 12 months, we've seen rollouts of some of those insights, AI products where you have \u2013 you can use the Dynamics of data, but also data from Salesforce in desk, et cetera, but as a sort of a side car there. So wondering if you could just sort of walk us through just sort of the, call it, the application strategy and then that in the context of what you're trying to do in the AI world?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. No, great. Thanks, Phil, for the question. Let me start, and then Amy, you can. I mean, we are very excited about what's happening with Dynamics 365 in particular, because when I look at what the world needs is it needs a business application suite that is more comprehensive. That can turn what is the real currency of this next era, which is data into predictions, insights and automation without boundaries. I mean, take even the Canada Goose, example that I had in my remarks, which is actually a pretty fascinating story of how they've been able to take the end-to-end nature of Dynamics 365, and really bring together the manufacturing, wholesale and retail operations to the next level of efficiency. That's I think, what is needed. And the way, we have architected it on top of Azure, its cloud native in terms of its use of databases. It's for example, all these insights modules, I referenced and you'd referenced are all built on Azure Synapse, so it's sort of deeply integrated into Azure. It integrates into LinkedIn. It integrates into Microsoft 365, Power platform the extensibility model for both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics is the same, which is Power platform. And that's a pretty \u2013 no, there's no such thing as a canonical business and no such thing as a canonical business over time, right? The business processes change. The question is how rapidly can people and domain experts keep up with the change and that's where Dynamics 365 absolutely shine. So we're excited about what's happening there. You mentioned a point about Sidecar. We think that, that's a very legitimate use case. There is a new category, in fact and a new race starting with CDP, and we are leading. And so I feel excited about that as well.\nAmy Hood: And to your question on how the Dynamics 365 sort of the excitement we have. When I think about the comment I made around adding workloads, what's so important about what Satya just talked about is, how this reaches into new budgets for us, new opportunity for us in terms of being able to tap growth that we had not been able to access before. And the way, I tend to think about that is not dissimilar from how I think of most per seat businesses. You add a seat and then you add workloads and the more you can do that in terms of tapping into new budgets, that's a great opportunity for us. So I think that's a frame that, I'll start to talk a little bit more about as we learn more about Dynamics 365 and its momentum. This is another place, I would call out, where I do think we can sort of focus and continue to make some investments in H2 based on the momentum we have seen in H1.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Phil. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. You can find additional details on the Investor \u2013 Microsoft Investor Relations website. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you very much.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2020, delivering $33 billion in revenue this quarter. Our Commercial Cloud business continues to grow at scale as we work alongside the world\u2019s leading companies to help them build their own digital capability. Microsoft provides a differentiated technology stack spanning application infrastructure, data and AI, developer tools and services, security and compliance, business process productivity and collaboration. First, each of these areas represents secular, long-term growth opportunities; second, we\u2019re delivering best-in-class innovation and openness in each layer; and third, we offer unparalleled integration and architectural coherence across the entire stack to meet the real world needs of our customers. Now, I\u2019ll briefly highlight how we\u2019re accelerating our progress in innovation, starting with Azure. Organizations today need a distributed computing fabric to meet their real world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. This quarter, we opened new data center regions in Germany and Switzerland. And in India, we\u2019re bringing the power of Microsoft Cloud to millions of small businesses through our partnership with Jio, one of the largest mobile carriers in the country. Every Fortune 500 customer today is on a cloud migration journey, and we are making it faster and easier. Just this week, we announced an extensive go-to-market partnership with SAP, making Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer. And our partnerships with VMware and Oracle also bring these ecosystems to our cloud. We\u2019re extending beyond the cloud to the edge, enabling customers to get real-time insights where data is generated while ensuring security and privacy. And we\u2019re seeing traction in every industry from Azure Sphere, securely connecting Starbucks coffee machines to Azure Stack, enabling scenarios from smart factories and modern compliant banking to mobile health care in remote areas. We are reimagining customers\u2019 data estates with the cloud era with new limitless capabilities. Azure SQL database brings hyper-scale capabilities to relational databases, and Azure Cosmos DB, the low-latency high-availability database for globally distributed applications of any data type. The quintessential characteristic of every application going forward will be AI. And we have the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure and services. Azure AI now has more than 20,000 customers, and more than 85% of the Fortune 100 companies are using Azure AI in the last 12 months. In health care, Novartis chose Azure AI to transform how medicines are discovered, developed and commercialized. Nuance will rely on our cloud to power the patient exam room of the future where clinical documentation writes itself. And Humana is using Azure AI to build personalized health care solutions for its more than 10 million members. We\u2019re also pushing the bounds of how computers and AI can generalize learning beyond narrow domains, collaborating with OpenAI on a supercomputing platform to train and run AI models. I\u2019m excited about our partnership and our collective pursuit to democratize AI, and its benefits for everyone. Now to developer tools. The rise of digital IP creation in every organization means developers will increasingly drive and influence every business process and function, and GitHub is where they go to learn, share and collaborate. GitHub has grown to more than 40 million developers, up more than 30% since our acquisition a year ago and more than 2 million organizations use GitHub, including the majority of the Fortune 50. At Ford Motor Company alone, 8,000 employees use GitHub to innovate and collaborate with the vast ecosystem of third-party software developers. Our acquisition of semantic code analysis engine, Semmle, this quarter, strengthens our security capabilities, enabling developers to more easily find vulnerabilities in large open source code bases. Now, let\u2019s turn to our workflow cloud Power Platform. Automating workflows across every function will be key to productivity gains for every organization. We are building Power Platform as the extensibility framework for both, Microsoft 365 inclusive of Microsoft Teams as well as Dynamics 365. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation and self service analytics, enabling everyone in an organization to build an intelligent app or workflow where none exists. Power Platform already has more than 2.5 million monthly active citizen developers. PowerApps helps domain experts, those closest to the business problem to design, build and publish custom apps fast. And 84% of the Fortune 500 have already created power applications. Now, let\u2019s talk about security. Rising cyber threats and increasing regulation mean security and compliance on a strategic priority for every organization. We have a comprehensive offering across identity, security and compliance spanning people device -- people, devices, apps, developer tools, data and infrastructure to protect customers in today\u2019s zero trust environment. It starts with Azure Active Directory Premium used by more than 100,000 organizations for identity, access management and SaaS application security across heterogeneous environment. It builds with information protection and cloud security with Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and now with risk-based vulnerability management. And it extends to Azure Sentinel, now broadly available. Sentinel is a cloud first service that analyzes security signal at massive scale across the entire organization using AI to detect, investigate, and automatically remediate threats. We\u2019ll share more about our expanding opportunity in security at our Ignite Conference in the next few weeks. Now, on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is the only AI powered business cloud that gives customers a 360-degree view of their business, from marketing and sales to finance and operations to unified data and unlock insights. It enables every level of organization to move from reactive silo transaction processes to proactive, repeatable and predictable business outcomes. This quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 Commerce, a new omni-channel solution to unify back office, in-store and digital experiences, and deliver personalized content wherever shoppers are. Dynamics 365 AI insights app ingests data from any first party or third party source, freeing data from systems of record to power modern systems of engagement and intelligence. New, Dynamics 365 Product Insights provides organizations like Ecolab, real time view of how customers are using their products to maximize customer lifetime value. And Dynamics 365 connected store helps retailers like Marks & Spencer analyze observational data to optimize in-store shopping experience. We\u2019re enabling our customers to bridge the physical and digital business processes with our mixed reality cloud spanning HoloLens 2, Azure mixed reality services, and Dynamics 365 applications. Pharmaceutical company, Patheon, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Guides along with HoloLens 2 to reimagine training for its employees. Now to LinkedIn. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter across the platform. Marketing Solutions remains our fastest growing segment, up 44% year-over-year, as marketers leverage our community-based tools to connect with LinkedIn, nearly 660 million members. We continue to innovate across our talent portfolio, including Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint, LinkedIn Learning to help every organization attract, retain and develop best talent. LinkedIn Skills Assessment is a new way for members to showcase their proficiency and become more discoverable to recruiters. Now, turning to Microsoft 365 and Surface. Earlier this month, we unveiled our broadest Surface lineup to date, including two new dual screen devices coming next year. We are reimagining every layer with how we infuse AI from silicon up to device form factors and the role of operating systems to help people be more productive and creative in a multi-sense, multi-device world. We will continue to invest across form and function to new create categories that benefit our entire OEM ecosystem. And our expanded partnership with Samsung builds on a promise to help people be more productive on any device anywhere, bringing one drive outlook in your phone, and more to new Samsung devices. Microsoft 365 is the world\u2019s productivity cloud and the only comprehensive solution that empowers everyone from the C suite to first line workers with an integrated secure work -- secure experience on any device. We\u2019re infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to help make work more intuitive and natural. New Presenter Coach and PowerPoint makes anyone a better public speaker, new capabilities in Word enabled professionals to transcribe or record audio files while staying in the flow. Video is more searchable, shareable, and first class within Microsoft 365 with Stream. And new inking capabilities let users create and reply to comments from anywhere, using pen or voice. Microsoft Teams continues to gain traction, bringing together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of office and business process workflow into a single integrated user experience, all with the highest security and compliance. Teams keeps all of your work, conversations and meetings in context, eliminating the need to bounce back and forth between different apps with features like integrated calendaring, one touch to join meetings from your phone, and we are broadening our opportunity with 2 billion firstline workers worldwide, adding priority notifications, role-specific targeted messages, and the ability to clock in and clock out of a shift. Our differentiated offering is driving usage making teams the category leader. More than 350 organizations now have more than 10,000 users of Teams. More broadly, all this innovation is fueling growth. Office 365 commercial monthly active users surpassed 200 million this quarter. The leading organizations like Cerner, Chevron and the LEGO Group are choosing our premium Microsoft 365 E5 offerings for their advanced security and productivity experiences. Finally, gaming. In gaming, we\u2019re investing in content, community and cloud services to expand our opportunity with 2 billion gamers worldwide. We saw record Xbox Live monthly active users with strength both on and off console in mobile and PC, and continued growth for Game Pass subscriptions. Gears 5 saw more than 3 million players in its first weekend alone. 10 years in Minecraft is stronger than ever with record revenue and usage, and we are bringing the franchise to new audiences with Minecraft Earth. Finally, just last week, we started trials of Project xCloud, so gamers can play games wherever and whenever they want on any device. In closing, we are accelerating our innovation across the entire technology stack to deliver new value for customers. We\u2019re investing aggressively in large markets with significant growth potential, and it\u2019s still early days. With that I\u2019ll hand over to Amy who will call our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $33.1 billion, up 14%, and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18%, and 20% in constant currency. Operating income increased 27%, and 32% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.38, increasing 21%, and 25% in constant currency. Consistent execution and strong demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove a solid start to the fiscal year with another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across all markets. In our Commercial business, we again saw increased customer commitment across our cloud platform. In Azure, we had material growth in the number of $10 million plus contracts. Additionally, Microsoft 365 drove new customer adoption as well as expansion in our existing customer base, given the strong value Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility and Security provide at a secure intelligence solution. As a result, Commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 30%, and 35% in constant currency, with a higher volume of new business and strong renewal execution. Commercial annuity mix increased to 91% and Commercial unearned revenue was ahead of expectations at $31.1 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Our Commercial remaining performance obligation was $86 billion, up 26% and 27% in constant currency, driven by these long-term customer commitments. As a reminder, going forward, we will disclose the Commercial remaining performance obligations as a KPI, which better reflects commitments our customers are making across all contract types. Commercial Cloud revenue was $11.6 billion, growing 36% and 39% in constant currency. Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points year-over-year year to 66%, as significant improvement in Azure gross margin offset a sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 3 points for year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix to higher margin businesses. The U.S. dollar was a bit weaker than anticipated, which resulted in slightly less impact to our results. FX reduced revenue growth by less than 2 points, and cogs and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. Operating expenses grew 8% to 9% in constant currency, slightly lower than expectations mainly driven by the timing of marketing and project spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter, driven by the combination of higher gross margins and operating leverage through effective resource allocation. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.1 billion, increasing 13% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by On-Premises Office Commercial business. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency, and benefited approximately 2 points from the transactional strength in Japan. Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 25% and 28% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Office 365 Commercial Seats increased 21% with a growing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite. Office Consumer revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan, more than offsetting the strong prior year comparable related to the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 35.6 million. Dynamics revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 41% and 44% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 26% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions increased 22% as engagement again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offsets an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and Cloud Engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 27% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $10.8 billion, increasing 27% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by our on-premises server business. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued demand from our hybrid value. Azure revenue increased 59% and 63% in constant currency, with strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments, partially offset by further moderation in our per-user business. Our Enterprise Mobility installed base grew 36% to over 120 million seats, benefiting from the Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across our hybrid and premium offerings, GitHub and roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for SQL and Windows Server 2008. Enterprise Services revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 30% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was up slightly as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin was partially offset by a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 22%, driven by ongoing engineering and sales investments and cloud and AI, including GitHub. Operating income grew 33% and 38% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11.1 billion, increasing 4% and 5% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better than expected performance in our OEM Pro and Windows Commercial businesses, more than offset lower than expected monetization across third-party titles within gaming. In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 7%, below the consumer PC market, with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 19%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by strong Windows 10 demand and momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 26% and 29% in constant currency, driven by healthy demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition. Surface revenue declined 4% and 2% in constant currency, driven by the timing of product lifecycle transitions ahead of the recently announced product launches. Search revenue ex TAC increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, driven by Bing rate growth. In gaming, revenue declined 7% and 6% in constant currency, driven by lower console sales. Xbox content and services revenue was relatively unchanged and increased 1% in constant currency with growth from Minecraft, Gears of War 5 and Game Pass subscriptions offset by a strong third-party title in the prior year. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 4 points due to higher margin sales mix. Operating expenses declined 7% and 6% in constant currency as redeployment of engineering resources to higher growth opportunities was partially offset by investments in gaming. As a result, operating income grew 28% and 31% in constant currency. Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services and slightly below expectations due to normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build out. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $13.8 billion and increased 1% year-over-year, as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by tax payments related to the Q4 transfer of intangible property. Free cash flow was $10.4 billion and increased 4%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 27% and 39%, respectively. As expected, in other income and expense, interest income was offset by interest expense, foreign currency remeasurement and recognized losses on investments. Our effective tax rate was 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 28% year-over-year. Now, let\u2019s move to our outlook. Assuming current rate remains stable, we expect FX to decrease Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points, total Company Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing revenue growth by approximately 1 point, and have no impact on total Company COGS and operating expenses growth. We expect another strong quarter in our commercial business. Demand for our hybrid offerings and cloud services remained strong and capital expenditures will continue to reflect that. Given the normal variability and infrastructure spend timing, we expect Q2 CapEx spend to be down slightly on a sequential basis, but still growing from the prior year. And Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve on a year-over-year basis, even with the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion, driven by double-digit growth across Office Commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.25 billion and $11.45 billion. In Azure, we expect continued strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business, given the size of the installed base. Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid and premium solutions, as well as the continued benefit from increased demand ahead of the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.6 million and $13 million. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should again be ahead of the PC market as we balance healthy Windows 10 demand and the benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows 7 with the supply chain\u2019s ability to meet this demand in Q2. Based on our customer demand signal and prior end of support cycles, we expect some continued momentum past January, end of support deadline. In Windows Commercial, products and cloud services, we expect another strong quarter, benefiting from continued Microsoft 365 momentum. In Surface, the launch of the latest Surface Pro and Surface laptop devices should drive low double digit revenue growth on a strong prior year comparable. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20% range driven by lower console sales as we near the end of this generation, as well as the most challenging quarterly comparable and third-party titles from last year. Now, back to overall Company guidance. We expect COGS of $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion, and operating expenses of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full-year rate of 17%. Now, let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the Company level, we continue to expect double digit revenue and operating income growth, driven by continued momentum in our commercial business. Given our strong first quarter results and the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year, even as we continue to invest with significant ambition in high growth areas. With that, Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I was hoping to dig in a little bit into the Intelligent Cloud business and what you guys are seeing there from a hybrid perspective. And so, maybe one question for Satya and one for Amy. For Satya, can you talk to us a little bit about sort of how these hybrid engagements are kind of rolling out with the larger customers, how they are contracting from it? And any sense you can give us in terms of in what way do they engage, both kind of the on-premise assets as well as the cloud assets? Because I think the part of the equation is really positively surprising a lot of investors and how well Server & Tools is doing. And then, maybe for Amy, you could help us understand sort of when we look at Server & Tools up 14% in constant currency, which is well ahead of our expectations, how should we think about the durability of that in terms of what comes from sort of the pull forward of demand ahead of some -- like SQL Server and Windows Server expirations? And what is going to be more durable over time on the back of those pull forwards?\nSatya Nadella: Sure, Keith. Thanks for the question. Overall, our approach has always been about this distributed computing fabric or thinking about hybrid as not as some transitory phase, but as a long-term vision for how computing will meet the real world needs. Because if you think about the long-term, compute will migrate to wherever data is getting generated, and increasingly there will be data generated in the real world, where just when you think about the cloud, you have to think about the edge of the cloud as a very first class construct. So, in that context, what we see is a couple of things that you see even in the results today. One is the hybrid benefits. That is increasingly what is getting customers excited about the Azure choice and the fact that they can renew, knowing that they have the flexibility of both the cloud and the edge. That\u2019s definitely driving growth. Second is we\u2019re also gaining share. When you think about what\u2019s happening even with the edge, some of the -- our data center addition products are very competitive in the marketplace. And so, you see both of those effects. But architecturally, we feel well-placed. In fact at our Ignite Conference, you will see us even take the next leap forward even in terms of how we think about the architecture inclusive of the application models, programming models on what distributed computing looks like going forward. So, we feel well-positioned there.\nAmy Hood: And Keith, to your question on sort of durability, we tried to call out the four points that we felt transactionally was due to the end of support, and that\u2019s 4 of the 12 in USD. And so -- but for us, if you step back for a second, the durable trends that Satya just talked about, which is making sure we license in a way that respects this long-term reality of where data and compute will be needed is what we call the hybrid value proposition, and the rights to that of course are inherent in how we report this number. And so, for us, what you\u2019ll see is premium strength, which we saw this quarter in both SQL and Windows because of some of the value proposition of hybrid and of course broad strength as well, when people feel that flexibility to not be constrained by licensing in terms of how they view their estate.\nKeith Weiss.: Excellent. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Keith. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much. This is a question for Amy. I was just wondering, you\u2019ve been saying for a while now that you\u2019re seeing material improvements in Azure gross margins, and that\u2019s obviously hugely benefited Commercial Cloud gross margin. I\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us how much of the improvement is related to the need to maybe expand data centers at a lower clip than you have been, and maybe it\u2019s less depreciation and amortization that\u2019s coming that you\u2019re starting to recognize. How much of it is due to just better capacity utilization? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much longer you\u2019re going to be able to say that for, I guess, and just have you guys been ratcheting up your target gross margins for Azure over the years to where you think they could be, as you look ahead? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying, in general, at the Commercial Cloud gross margin, what you\u2019re seeing is revenue growth that for the past, almost two years has vastly been faster than our capital expenditure growth. So, if you start at the top of the frame, what we\u2019re seeing is overall gross margin improvement across portfolio and improving -- and that comes from a couple of things, which is where you\u2019re getting to on Azure. It comes from structural improvement on sort of cost per unit but it also comes from mix shift of revenue to premium services from being able to sell more SaaS-like services and consumption services or even premium data services that really do have both, more margin but also are quite consistent in terms of their growth, and you see then that represented as improving targets for us. But, I would say in general, Heather, what the team has done has actually delivered on what I think we felt was a five-year roadmap of improving gross margins on a material basis. Now, as you continue to see the mix shift to the consumption-based Azure services, the overall cloud gross margin will improve at the same rate, and we\u2019ve said that and you\u2019ll continue to see that on a go-forward basis as well. But, we do continue to expect Azure, especially on the consumption side gross margins to improve and they still have room to improve, especially as we start to see some of these premium services both being made available and being utilized at higher rates.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Heather. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Amy, question for you. When I look at your next quarter guidance by revenue segment, it seems to equate to an overall revenue growth rate, assuming the midpoint of about 9% to 10%. So, when I combine that with the 14% growth you just put up in Q1, it implies that in the second half overall Microsoft revenue growth should remain roughly in the 10% ZIP code to enable you to get to double-digit growth for the full year, despite the fact that you\u2019re moving past some fairly key end of support milestones. I think, some of us were expecting a little bit more of a first half, second half delta. So, I just wanted to ask you what are the maybe one or two or three drivers that enable you to sustain that growth rate in the second half, and if it\u2019s fair to assume that your guidance doesn\u2019t really reflect any deterioration in the overall spending environment? Thanks a lot.\nAmy Hood: Yes. I think, in general, Karl, a couple of things I would point to, or many of the things I talked about in the comments that we prepared. Overall, Q1 was a very strong start commercially from a bookings perspective with some very strong trends across the board. Whether it is in both the absolute size and number of the Azure commitments that we\u2019re seeing, the consistency we\u2019re seeing in the consumption growth rates of Azure, the commitments we\u2019re seeing to Microsoft 365, some of the signs we\u2019re seeing across our Dynamics, the Power Platform, the workflow cloud that Satya referred to and LinkedIn, it\u2019s a good bookings quarter, a good execution quarter on overall contracting value. Renewals were good, recapture rates were good, and new business was good. So, with that confidence, some of those same trends that we had talked about, of course show up through the year. And we\u2019ve tried to be consistent in that, while end of support will make for points here and there each quarter, the more sustainable trends are the fact that our Commercial Cloud overall offers significant value and differentiation to customers, and they are making longer term commitments, and we continue to grow ARPU. So, when I think about sort of some of the seasonality that you\u2019re talking about, Q2, I thought we were -- I wanted to be clear that that\u2019s really a gaming challenge in Q2. And you see that reflected in the margins in Q2 being significantly better than they were last Q2. And if you think about H2, I do expect Surface will have some easier comparables in H2 and a new portfolio to grow from. So, I think that\u2019s another change you\u2019ll see in trajectory in H2 as well.\nKarl Keirstead: Terrific. Thank you, Amy.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Karl. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. AI is obviously a large focus; it was a large driver of Intelligent Cloud OpEx spending growth this quarter. Satya, can you give us some more color on where you see Microsoft on the AI journey? And, Amy, is this investing way ahead of revenue, or is AI already driving big revenue for Azure, how should we think about it? I appreciate it. Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Mark. It\u2019s a great question, because we look at what\u2019s happening with AI having 2 dimensions to it. One is, I would say just our own use of AI as first-party SaaS applications. There are some phenomenal breakthroughs when you see new transcription features or new computer vision features that come with HoloLens. All of these are being driven by new AI capabilities that are all by the way powered by the same cloud infrastructure. We all build everything at Microsoft with first party equals third party with Azure as the core platform. And so what you see us is in fact using our own SaaS applications and consumer innovation even to drive the high end AI capability, but then bringing the best-in-class tooling for enterprise customers. So, for example, like we have innovated even in, what does DevOps look like for the machine learning age? That\u2019s a unique capability that\u2019s there in Azure ML. And those are the types of innovations that are even driving the projects that our enterprise customers have on Azure. So, you will see us leverage our overall spend, whether it\u2019s CapEx or OpEx across all of what Microsoft does and then surface them in I think what is perhaps the best way to get traction in the enterprise market, which is great tooling, compliance, security. And that\u2019s a place where we\u2019re making good progress.\nAmy Hood: And so, for me Mark, it\u2019s a little bit hard for me to say, gosh, we invest in AI here and you\u2019ll see it specifically here. What I think, you heard through Satya\u2019s commentary is actually AI woven through every layer and component of the entire tech stack, and how important that is, whether you\u2019re participating at the Dynamics 365 layer with Insights or whether you\u2019re using components, like some of our customers are maybe for a natural interaction work. And so, for me, it is almost fundamental to see that cost and investment, because you\u2019ll see it in margin and usage, and frankly product differentiation that we can provide versus our competitors.\nMark Moerdler: Excellent. I really appreciate it. Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Amy, there\u2019s been a lot of macro concern among tech investors, given some of the peers in your group have seen some weakness. It doesn\u2019t seem that you have seen anything. But, I\u2019m curious if you could just comment on what you\u2019re seeing from a demand perspective.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. What I would say is for us, it has been so important to remain focused on where growth and opportunity exist, and to invest in those areas that are large, expansive and durable TAM. And I think, when you think about where we spend our time both building products, investing in marketing, investing in sales capability and technical capability, it has been in many, if not all, of those places. So, when I look and say, where is our execution or how do I think about our ability to execute in a macro environment, for me, it is about investing in the right places, executing in a great way, remaining focused on the transition, our customers need us to help them through to create their own opportunity and their own growth. And I think, we\u2019ve done a nice job of being invested in the right places. Satya mentioned a few of them on the call, but there are really many. If you think about security, compliance, communication, workflow, business process reinvention, the list can go on and on where I feel like we have set up a multiyear journey to be well-positioned. And I tend to think of every quarter, every year as an opportunity to continue to differentiate, invest in innovation, and execute well to take share. And so, that\u2019s I think how I\u2019ve approached that.\nSatya Nadella: And I think, that\u2019s probably the unifying theme quite frankly of all the questions so far, which is what\u2019s next. What\u2019s next for us is in the apps and infra go from perhaps first innings to second innings; for data and AI to start the first innings. When it comes to security, compliance, we never participated in this. Guess what, we get to participate in a fairly competitive way now. We\u2019ve built, something that didn\u2019t even exist a few years ago, which is the workflow cloud. That\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. Biz apps, we are a very competitive and growing footprint. Even when you think about something like Microsoft 365, we never participated, in spite of our past success with all the first-line work, and now we get to participate in it. So, I see long-term secular growth opportunities and we are going to stay focused on making sure our innovation is competitive in all those layers we talked about.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another really impressive quarter. Satya, I want to focus on the strategic announcements you talked about earlier in the call, the Oracle, VMware and obviously the most recent one with SAP. Wondering if you would just walk us through the sort of the strategic thoughts behind these. And then, also, especially with VMware and Oracle, since those are out there obviously longer, what\u2019s the feedback from customers been? And then, I guess, to Amy, how do you think about sort of these big strategic differences [ph] this year actually showing up in the numbers?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Phil, thanks. So, overall, I think, this is again one of those things where in the past we participated in the infrastructure business, but we had a fairly narrow footprint, which is we had our own infrastructure that supported primarily our databases and our operating systems. Whereas with the migration to the cloud, customers are looking for us to be a provider of all their infrastructure needs, which is heterogeneous. And that\u2019s what has really led us at the infrastructure layer to have partnerships with VMware and Oracle. We, as you know, have first-class support for Windows and Linux, Java and .NET, Postgres and SQL, VMware, Red Hat as well as obviously Windows hypervisor. So, I feel that we now have that ability to be able to take the entire infrastructure estate, the entire data estate and really add value with these partnerships. And SAP represents the same because SAP has got both infrastructure, we now are the preferred cloud. So, I think, it\u2019s a fairly no-brainer for any customer who is an SAP customer who wants to accelerate their migration to the cloud and innovation from SAP and us that they should move to Azure. And that\u2019s what this announcement was all about. And so, we\u2019re really looking forward to essentially executing on that strategy and that customer need that we see very clearly.\nAmy Hood: And Phil, to your question on where would we see this. You\u2019d actually see it in a couple of places, not just in Azure, which may in fact be the most logical extension. But, at the heart of this is making it easier, faster and more reliable for us to help customers move their estate to the cloud and to migrate that with confidence. And so, when we do that, it\u2019s about becoming a committed partner. And you actually see that in broader Microsoft Cloud results whether that\u2019s helping even through these partnerships to be able and get closer to Tier 1 workloads, business process changes. And so, I actually think these are quite important for us to continue to make sure the first goal is customer centric, which is why we continue to move in this direction.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Phil. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you. I think, this is probably an Amy question. As I sort of parse through the Dynamics within Office 365 and through the discussion around sustainability of double-digit growth within the Commercial segment, we\u2019ve seen seat count decelerate, also the uplift on pricing maybe isn\u2019t as much as quarter as we saw in the past, which leads me to believe that there you are seeing a lot of success in the frontline worker piece and maybe that\u2019s a bigger driver of the seat count from here. But, can you just -- and at the same time you\u2019re seeing strong uptake of the premium SKUs as well. But, as we think about seat count going forward, how much opportunity is there still left on the migration front of commercial licenses versus leaning a bit more on things like frontline worker to sustain that growth? And is there a point where potentially the seat growth and things like frontline could start to eat further into your ability to continue to lift ARPU on the base you already have?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Jen. Let me break this question apart, because you are actually asking important dynamics that I don\u2019t always think of as trade-off. And so, I want to make that more clear in my answer. First, to your question on seat growth. We have room, even beyond just first-line workers, whether that is our ability in small and mid-sized businesses, on a global basis with mobile first workers, this is a very broad opportunity for us to reach people, trying to accomplish tasks and do their work on devices of any size. And so, there is significant room for us to continue to make progress on that front. Now, could that end up with some ARPU pressure long term? It certainly could. But, the important for me -- I don\u2019t think of that as being necessarily a negative. We used to really make no money through the seats that we just talked about. And so, every dollar or multiple dollars or many dollars earned on those new seats is all new revenue, new opportunity and new socket for us. Let me separate that from the next dynamic, which is why sort of an average number may not be the best indication, which is our ability to continue to move people to higher value SKUs, whether that\u2019s through the addition of really compelling things in security or compliance or communications or collaboration or knowledge or learning, where we can add value. Whether we call that E5 or E3, we have room in that transition as well and new opportunity in a way that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen that. I feel very optimistic about M 365 -- I\u2019m sorry, Microsoft 365 and our ability to continue to add value. So, hopefully that helps, Jen.\nJennifer Lowe: Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Jen. Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick question on Azure. If I look at the SAP announcements, but you had some other industry announcements out there smell like Humana, et cetera. Like, how do I have to think about the progress you guys are making there in terms of getting more into the different industries and to kind of create deeper relationships around Azure evolving and just doing kind of simple infrastructure outsourcing? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. It\u2019s a very deliberate strategy that we have. In meeting our customers\u2019 needs, we need to have the partners they already work with and want to work with also on our platform. So, it starts sometimes with the customers, whether it\u2019s Humana or Walgreens or Walmart and others. It also starts with partners like Nuance, which is another one that we announced recently. And so, the idea is for us to be really ensuring that by every industry we have the right marquee customers as well as the partners and have strong go to markets. One of the things that everyone I think in the marketplace understands is Microsoft for especially from a partner perspective is a great route to market. We have a platform directly with our sales force, as well as our channel, that is very attractive to third-party developers to get on Azure, and they realize those benefits. And in fact, our customers rely on that as also as a benefit because it helps them get the best value from their partners as well.\nMike Spencer: Thanks, Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks much, Brett. We had a very strong close to our fiscal year. Our commercial cloud surpassed $69 billion in annual revenue, up 34%. We have seen revenue growth across industries, customer segments and geographies with over 50% of sales coming from outside the United States. We continue to grow new franchises for Microsoft in large and growing markets. In the past three years alone, gaming, security and now LinkedIn, have all surpassed $10 billion in annual revenue. Now, I\u2019ll highlight our innovation and our expanding opportunity across the tech stack starting with infrastructure. Moving forward, every organization will need more ubiquitous and decentralized computing. We\u2019re the only cloud provider with the capability to support every organization\u2019s multi-cloud, hybrid and edge needs. Over the past year we have added new data center regions in 15 countries across five continents, delivering faster access to cloud services and addressing data residency requirements. And now, we\u2019re taking cloud compute to the edge with 5G deployments. Our new Azure edge services help operators and enterprises deliver ultra-low-latency compute fabric. And we\u2019re also helping operators run their networks in the cloud. AT&T chose Azure to power its 5G core network, making it the first Tier 1 operator to move its existing customer traffic to the public cloud. We\u2019re also expanding our opportunity in hybrid. Today over 75% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise multi-cloud and the edge. With Arc, customers like EY and Telstra can manage their Kubernetes deployments anywhere and deploy Azure SQL databases and run Azure application services on any infrastructure. As the digital and physical worlds converge, we are leading in a new layer of the infrastructure stack, the enterprise metaverse. AB InBev is using our solutions, including Azure Digital Twins and Azure IoT to optimize operations from the barley field to the warehouse, to distribution. Customers also continue to choose our infrastructure to run mission-critical SAP solutions. Thousands of enterprises have migrated their ERP workloads to Azure, including Campbell Soup, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Mondel\u0113z International, ServiceNow and even SAP. All this innovation is driving larger and more strategic Azure commitments from industry leaders, including Mars in consumer goods, Morgan Stanley in financial services and NEC in IT. Now, on to data. Data is the most strategic asset for every business. We\u2019re the only cloud provider that helps organizations build sovereignty over their data by bringing together hyperscale, OLTP, analytics and governance workloads. Cosmos DB has become the go-to database, powering the world\u2019s most demanding mission-critical workloads. New capabilities help organizations like Albertsons, ASOS, DHL, LaLiga, Maersk, Swiss Re optimize cost and boost performance. Walmart is using Cosmos DB to handle billions of online requests daily and to ensure millions of customers receive the items they want when they need them. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, big data and data warehouses into a single service. From ABN AMRO in finance and AmerisourceBergen in pharma to Walgreens in retail and WPP in advertising, organizations are using Synapse to generate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Queries performed using Synapse increased 146% over the last quarter alone. Now on to developers. GitHub is used by 72% of the Fortune 50 to build, ship, and maintain software. Organizations like Ford, NASA and Shopify are using new project planning capabilities to help developers better manage projects directly within their workflow. And Epic Games, Motorola Solutions and Volkswagen Software Group all chose GitHub Advanced Security this quarter to help secure their code. We\u2019re also leading in enterprise AI. Our new Azure Applied AI Services help organizations like Dow, Lufthansa and Samsung apply AI to common business scenarios. And live captions in Twitter Spaces are being powered by our speech services. Finally, we are bringing the power of our partnership with OpenAI to both professional developers and domain experts. With GitHub Copilot, professional developers can write code faster with less work and using the world\u2019s most powerful language model, GPT-3, domain experts can build apps using natural language with Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts across all functions. Power BI is the leader in business intelligence in the cloud. Organizations in every industry, including Bayer, Cerner, Rolls-Royce are choosing the platform to foster a data-driven culture. The number of organizations using Power Apps has more than doubled year-over-year. BASF chose Power Apps to give 122,000 employees the capability to build low-code no-code apps. And the Toyota Fusion teams of pro developers and domain experts are using Power Apps and Azure Pass services to improve quality control. All up, Power Platform revenue increased 83% over the past year. And now, on to Dynamics 365. Every business function, including marketing, sales, customer support and supply chain will need to be re-imagined for an AI-first and collaboration-first world. And the silos between communications, collaboration and business process have to be broken down. With Dynamics 365, we are building a new generation of business applications to help organizations adapt to this new reality. We continue to gain share. Dynamics 365 revenue accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, up 49% year-over-year. We are helping businesses to become digitally sovereign over their customer interactions with our customer insights product with organizations like Columbia Sportswear, GNC and LA Clippers all choosing to unify customer profiles and deliver more personalized experiences. We are empowering employees for hybrid work by creating a new category of collaborative applications, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. New integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams enable anyone in an organization to seamlessly view and collaborate on customer records within Teams without having to purchase multiple licenses. Customers want this and no other vendor is doing this today. And we are helping organizations re-imagine their core business process with new apps built for an age of omnichannel communications. With Dynamics 365, customer service organizations like Coca-Cola, Renault and Xiaomi have a single comprehensive solution to deliver consistent and personalized support across all channels. Now on to industry solutions. Over the past year, we have introduced industry clouds for financial services, health care, manufacturing, nonprofits and retail. And this quarter, we announced our new Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, bringing together capabilities across our stack to create an entirely new business process category to help every organization address this very urgent need. Now, on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn\u2019s revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time this fiscal year, up 27%, a testament to how mission-critical the platform has become to help people connect, learn, grow and get hired over the course of their careers. In the past five years since our acquisition, revenue has nearly tripled and growth has accelerated. LinkedIn has become a leader across multiple secular growth areas spanning B2B advertising, professional hiring, corporate learning and sales intelligence. And from LinkedIn profiles within Office to LinkedIn Learning courses within Microsoft Viva and LinkedIn Sales Navigator leads within Microsoft Dynamics 365, we have brought together the power of LinkedIn and Microsoft to transform how people learn, sell and connect. LinkedIn has more than 774 million members who are more engaged than ever. Sessions were up 30% this quarter compared to a year ago. And LinkedIn\u2019s advertising business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this quarter for the first time, up 97% year-over-year, growing 3 times faster than the category. Now to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work represents the biggest change to the way we work in a generation and will require a new operating model spanning people, places and processes. We\u2019re the only cloud that supports everything an organization needs to successfully make the shift. Microsoft Teams is the new front end. It\u2019s where people meet, chat, call, collaborate and automate business processes all within the flow of work. Teams usage has never been higher. We are nearly 250 million monthly active users as people use Teams each day to communicate, collaborate and co-author content across work, life and learning. We are leading in the new and growing enterprise phone category. Just like video meetings, chat and business processes happen in Teams, calls happen in Teams, creating a huge new opportunity. We have nearly 80 million monthly active Teams phones users, with total calls surpassing 1 billion in a single month this quarter, and we\u2019re just getting started. Teams is also at the center of orchestrating collaboration across the entire SaaS estate from HR to marketing to finance. Leading third-party SaaS vendors, including Adobe, Atlassian, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have now built apps that deeply integrate with Teams, bringing every business process and function directly into the flow of work. And we are bringing Teams to consumers, so people can connect and collaborate with family and friends across desktop, mobile and the web. All this innovation is driving growth. 124 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and nearly 3,000 have more than 10,000 users. More broadly, across Microsoft 365, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year seat growth in every segment from frontline and small business to enterprise. Leading companies like Bayer, Siemens, Vodafone, all chose our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to employee experience cloud. Having a digital employee experience platform is critical for every organization. With Microsoft Viva, we are creating an entirely new category, bringing together communications, learning, well-being and knowledge directly into the flow of work. New capabilities empower leaders to build human capital, nurture wellbeing and focus on employee results. We are seeing strong interest and early adoption in every industry from American Express and Barclays to AT&T and Mars. Humana chose Viva to help 26,000 employees make the shift to hybrid work, gaining insights on everything from collaboration trends to manager effectiveness. Now on to Windows. Windows 11 is the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. We are reimagining everything from the Windows platform to the Store to help people and organizations be more productive and secure and build a more open ecosystem for developers and creators. We are delighted by early feedback. More people have downloaded our early builds than any other Windows release or update in the history of our insider program. And along with our OEM ecosystem, we are excited to bring Windows 11 to new PCs, beginning this holiday. And with Windows 365, we are creating a new category, the Cloud PC. Just like applications move to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, enabling organizations to stream the full Windows experience to any employee\u2019s personal or corporate device. Now on to security. With the cybersecurity landscape more complex than ever, it\u2019s never been clearer that every organization will need to deploy and maintain a zero trust security architecture. This is driving accelerated demand for our integrated end-to-end solutions spanning identity, security, compliance and device management across all clouds and all platforms. No other vendor is recognized by analysts as the leader in as many categories. This is reflected in our share gains with nearly 600,000 organizations, including FedEx, Nestl\u00e9, NTT and Volkswagen using our security offerings across Azure and Microsoft 365. We saw a 70% increase in the number of small and medium business customers. And it\u2019s reflected in our sales growth, with annual revenue continuing to increase 40% year-over-year. We\u2019re going further to protect organizations and our recent acquisitions of CloudKnox, ReFirm Labs and RiskIQ bolster our security capabilities in key areas, including identity management, IoT and threat intelligence. Now, on to gaming. Gaming is the largest category in the entertainment industry, and we are expanding our opportunity to reach the world\u2019s 3 billion gamers wherever and whenever they play. We are all in on games. At E3 last month, we unveiled our biggest games lineup ever, announcing 27 new titles, which will all be available to Game Pass subscribers. Game Pass is growing rapidly and it\u2019s transforming how people discover, connect and play games. Subscribers play approximately 40% more games and spend 50% more than nonmembers. We continue to lead in the fast-growing cloud gaming market with last month -- just last month, we made Xbox Cloud gaming available on PCs as well as Apple phones and tablets via the browser in 22 countries with more to come. Millions have already streamed games to their desktops, tablets and phones. And the Xbox Series S and X are our fastest-selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold live to date than any previous generation. Finally, we continue to grow our opportunity in the creator economy, adding new ways for players to build and monetize their creations in many of our most popular games, including Flight Simulator and Minecraft. Creators earned more than double what they did a year ago across our titles. In closing, going forward, every person and every organization will require more digital technology to be more resilient and to transform. We are innovating across the entire tech stack to ensure our customers succeed in this new era. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $46.2 billion, up 21% and 17% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.17, increasing 49% and 42% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, focused execution by our sales and partner teams, along with broad-based strength across geographical markets and customer segments drove another very strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offering as well as increased long-term commitment to our platform drove significant growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. Customer reliance on the Microsoft Cloud drove sequential increases in usage across Teams, Power Platform and our Advanced Security and identity offerings, which are empowering organizations to shift to hybrid work and modernize business processes. And in LinkedIn Talent Solutions business, an improving job market drove strength in annual contracts and job postings. In our on-premises business, strong annuity performance across Officer, Server and Windows also benefited from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition under ASC 606. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and Surface were impacted by the ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Search and LinkedIn benefited from an improved advertising market. And in gaming, we again saw strong engagement across our platform, while demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles continued to exceed supply. As a reminder, Q4 was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 a year ago across revenue and operating expense. This quarter, even with a declining exploration base, commercial bookings grew 30% and 25% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 31% in constant currency to $141 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 25% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, highlighting the growing long-term commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 95%. Commercial cloud revenue, also better than expected, was $19.5 billion as growth accelerated to 36% and 31% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4 points year-over-year to 70%, with roughly 1 point from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased despite revenue mix shift to Azure, driven by improvement across all our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by strategic investments we made to support significant customer engagement and usage in remote work scenarios, including free trials, flexible financing options and capacity for cloud infrastructure usage. With the weaker U.S. dollar, FX increased growth by approximately 4 points, about 1 point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 25% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 70%, up 2 points year-over-year, with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact, Company gross margin percentage increased despite sales mix shift to the cloud, driven by commercial cloud gross margin percentage improvement noted earlier. Operating expense grew 6% and 4% in constant currency, in line with expectations on a prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of impact from the realignment of our retail storage strategy and 2 points of impact from an increase in bad debt expense. Overall, Company headcount grew again this quarter, up 12% year-over-year as we continue to invest across key areas like cloud engineering, sales and customer deployment. Operating income increased 42% and 35% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded 6 points year-over-year to 41%, including roughly 2 points of impact from the retail stores charge and increase in bad debt expense in the prior year and nearly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $14.7 billion and grew 25% and 21% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Office Commercial revenue grew 20% and 15% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 25% and 20% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, with continued recovery driving acceleration in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Demand for Microsoft 365, particularly for security, compliance and voice drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 8% of our Office 365 Commercial installed base. And on a low prior year comparable impacted by a slowdown in transactional purchasing, Office Commercial licensing was ahead of expectations, down 8% and 11% in constant currency, also benefiting from higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. In Office Consumer, revenue grew 18% and 15% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew to 51.9 million, up 22% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 33% and 26% in constant currency, better than expected. Dynamics 365 revenue growth was 49%, and 42% in constant currency, with strong momentum in Power Apps and Power Automate, reflecting growing demand for our modern solutions to build apps and automate workflows. Dynamics 365 now accounts for over 70% of total Dynamics revenue. LinkedIn revenue increased 46% and 42% in constant currency, ahead of expectations against the comparable impacted by the advertising and job markets of a year ago. Segment gross margin dollars increased 33% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was up 5 points year-over-year, primarily driven by improvement in our cloud services against a low prior year comparable impacted mostly by increased usage. The change in accounting estimate drove roughly 1 point of favorable impact. Operating expense increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, and operating income increased 62% and 53% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17.4 billion, increasing 30% and 26% in constant currency. We exceeded expectations across our consumption and per-user Azure businesses as well as in our on-premises server products business. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 34% and 29% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 51% and 45% in constant currency, driven by strong performance across our core and premium consumption-based services. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base increased 29% to over 190 million seats. Our on-premise server business increased 16% and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong annuity performance and benefiting roughly 4 points from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier, particularly in some of our largest deals in the quarter. Enterprise Services revenue grew 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft consulting services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 32% and 27% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 14% and 12% in constant currency, and operating income grew 46% and 39% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.1 billion, increasing 9% and 6% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Windows Commercial, gaming and search offsetting OEM and Surface weakness from supply chain constraints. OEM revenue declined 3% and Surface declined 20% and 23% in constant currency as both were impacted by the significant supply chain constraints noted earlier in a good demand environment. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 14% in constant currency, driven by demand for Microsoft 365, with some benefit from the higher in-period revenue recognition, noted earlier. Search revenue ex TAC increased 53% and 49% in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market. And in gaming, revenue increased 11% and 7% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 172% and 163% in constant currency, driven by demand for our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue declined 4% and 7% in constant currency against a high prior year comparable. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expense decreased 6% and 7% in constant currency, including approximately 13 points of impact from the retail stores charge in the prior year. And operating income grew 19% and 13% in constant currency. Now, back to our total Company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.3 billion, in line with expectations, driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand and usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion, increasing 22% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $16.3 billion, up 17%, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. For FY21, we generated over $76 billion in operating cash flow, up 26% year-over-year, and over $56 billion in free cash flow, up 24% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $310 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was approximately 15%. And finally, we returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $39 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I\u2019d like to provide a few reminders for next fiscal year. Revenue growth rates across all segments will reflect the impact from COVID-19 a year ago, though the impacts do shift as we move through the year. Also, our FY21 operating income and margin benefited from two factors that will be headwinds in FY22: first, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $2.7 billion of depreciation expense, shifting from FY21 to future periods; and second, we saved nearly $1.2 billion in operating expense from COVID-19-related restrictions, which will also moderate in FY22 as geographies reopen globally. With those reminders in place, let\u2019s move to our next quarter outlook. Accelerating digital transformation and consistent strong execution should drive another quarter of growing commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, our core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base even against a strong prior year comparable. As always, quarterly volatility in bookings can be driven by an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, with roughly 4 points of negative impact from the change in accounting estimate previously discussed. Excluding the accounting change, Q1 gross margin percentage will increase despite revenue mix shift to Azure, driven by continued improvement across our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by the strategic investments we mentioned earlier. Longer term, which excludes the impact of the accounting change, commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by the same three things we often discuss, revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our cloud services and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers\u2019 success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue growth of the total Company and all individual segment levels by approximately 2 points and total operating expense and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $14.5 billion and $14.75 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline approximately 20%, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office Consumer, against a strong prior year comparable, we expect high-single-digit revenue growth with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets should drive revenue growth in the high 30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect continued strength in Dynamics 365, which includes our significant momentum in Power Apps to drive revenue growth in the high-20s. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.4 billion and $16.65 billion. In Azure, revenue will be driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rate, given the size of the installed base. Therefore, in constant currency, Azure revenue growth should remain relatively stable on a sequential basis. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we have estimated the Q1 impact of the required Windows 11 revenue deferral that will shift to Q2 to be approximately $300 million. Therefore, our segment revenue outlook is $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion. Given the 10-point estimated negative impact from the deferral, OEM revenue should decline mid to high single digits in Q1. In Surface, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the low teens as we continue to work through the supply chain challenges. In Windows Commercial, products and cloud services, continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive healthy double-digit growth. In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the high-30s, driven by improvements in the advertising market. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low double-digits. Console growth will again be constrained by supply. And on a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue should grow low single digits. Now back to Company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.55 billion to $13.75 billion and operating expense of $11.6 billion to $11.7 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than our expected full year rate, given the volume of equity vest in our first quarter. In closing, we remain focused on driving revenue growth as we invest boldly against the strategic high-growth opportunities ahead that will deliver significant value to our customers worldwide. Our outlook for FY22 reflects this with healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Together that results in expanded operating margins in FY22 after excluding the headwinds from the useful life change noted earlier. Together with our customers and partners, we look forward to FY22. Now Brett, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you for taking the question, guys. And congratulations on a great FY21 and a great end to the fiscal year. Satya, last year at this time, you made a comment that I think really defined the conversation in software over the past year. When you\u2019re talking about an acceleration in digital transformation you saw coming out of COVID, and I think that\u2019s evident in the results that we see here with 25% growth in your commercial bookings growth. What I want to ask you is the durability of that growth on a going-forward basis. Was that acceleration a pull forward of demand and at some point we\u2019re going to have that hard comp, or do you see durability in this acceleration on a go-forward basis? Is there a lot more to come? And then, Amy, to you, a similar kind of question but more on sort of the margin side of the equation. I think your entire tenure at Morgan -- at Microsoft has really been defined by good operational controls and ability to grow gross profit dollars well ahead of OpEx. Is that durable longer term? Is there still enough sort of efficiency gains at Microsoft to be able to keep that up over the medium term, if you will?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks so much, Keith, for the question. I mean, the way we see the results today reflect that, but more importantly, on a secular basis, as I think about -- I always go back to that number, which is 5% of the world GDP is tech spend, it\u2019s projected to double. I think that doubling will happen in a more accelerated pace. And we feel well-positioned because of the innovation across the stack. Because if you think about it, what\u2019s going to happen is every business, whether you\u2019re a retailer or a manufacturer, in the service sector, public sector or private sector, digital adoption is the way you\u2019re going to be both, resilient as well as transform the core business processes. And the strength we have is that entirety of the Microsoft Cloud stack, right? So, it\u2019s not just about infrastructure or any application, it\u2019s the entirety of what we do. And so, I think it is durable. Quarter-to-quarter, depending on what happened during the pandemic, depending on the segments that were impacted, for example, the consumer segments that were impacted are coming back and then they\u2019ll normalize. Whereas in our case, we do, in fact, one of the things I love about sort of our exposure is both, it\u2019s a worldwide exposure and it has got the right balance between the consumer segments and the enterprise business-to-business segment. So, it\u2019s a very durable long-term growth prospect that we have tough competition, we need to keep innovating, which is what we\u2019ll stay focused on.\nAmy Hood: And maybe turning to your margin question, and while I am obviously proud of the work we\u2019ve done, Keith, that you referenced as a team on margins and returns, I would say, in general, our focus remains and has been for the duration of really Satya and I\u2019ve work together along with the rest of the SLT on consistently moving our resources and talent to our highest growth and most differentiated places. When you do that in expansive total addressable markets in the way that I believe we\u2019re focused on as an organization, you do see the type of operating leverage that you\u2019re referring to in margins. And that along, as you see sort of mathematically with a shift in our revenue to higher overall gross margin segments, you do get the results we\u2019ve seen. So, I feel very good about the work we\u2019ve done. And as you heard, I\u2019m quite optimistic about the opportunities we have to invest, leading into FY22 as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking the question. And again, also, congrats on the quarter, and Amy, thanks for the details and color, especially in the guidance. So, I want to ask about seasonality in Azure. Traditionally, we\u2019ve seen seasonality in the Azure numbers in Q4. And obviously, last year, we didn\u2019t see it because of COVID, but we also didn\u2019t see it this year. Has something changed that has changed the seasonality of the business? And does that continue going forward? And then, as a follow-up question, Keith asked about OpEx efficiency overall, but I\u2019d like to ask specifically on the cloud. Is there any reason that cloud OpEx shouldn\u2019t continue to grow slower than revenue, obviously, on an annual basis, not a quarterly basis? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Mark, for the question. Let me cover your first one, which is the seasonality in the Azure business. In some ways, Mark, some of that seasonality frankly was because Azure has two fundamental components. It\u2019s got a consumption model as well as a per-user model. The per-user model, which as you well know is far more aligned to our end-of-year and can be more aligned to our end-of-year rhythms. It also can have more quarterly volatility in terms of accounting, in terms of revenue recognition, the same topic we often talk about when it comes to Microsoft 365 in terms of more in-quarter recognition. What you\u2019ve seen is that did historically represent a larger component of Azure, so added volatility to Q4. As we\u2019ve seen our consumption businesses grow and grow consistently, thus far becoming a larger percentage of Azure, you do have more stability, Mark. And so, you start seeing less of that volatility that we\u2019ve historically seen from Q3 to Q4. We still have some of it, as we talked about, but I think it\u2019s an interesting observation and it\u2019s a very good question. In terms of your comment on cloud revenue and OpEx, yes, I do believe that\u2019s durable. We get a lot of focus. We\u2019ll continue to invest. There\u2019s lots of opportunity there, but the market certainly warrants it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Amy, a lot of questions on margins, I\u2019m curious if you think there is the ceiling in the near term on margins, or do you feel that you\u2019ve got an elevated flight level, if you will, and we shouldn\u2019t have to be worrying about that level of margins? Can you just give us any more color as it relates to how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Well, I think for FY22 on operating margins, which is really where I focus most of my thoughts, as I said, when you exclude the useful life change, I feel very good about margin improvement in FY22. But, what sits behind that, Keith is -- I mean, sorry, Brent, is this focus on the first thing I said, which is with every operating expense dollar we invest, are we continuing to invest in the highest growth places? If you continue to invest in high-growth places with differentiation that customers care about and you add value, you continue to see improvements in this area. From time to time, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be quarters where that isn\u2019t the case, if we have some mix shift in hardware, et cetera. But in general, over a longer period of time, you\u2019ve seen us focus on this. And so, if you remove a little of the noise and some of the useful life changes and look back a few years, I do think you\u2019d see the biggest needle mover being where we invest the dollars as opposed to the overall amount of them, which should grow based on the opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks very much. Amy, thank you for giving more formal Azure guidance for the next quarter. That\u2019s very helpful. So, if Azure is going to remain stable in constant currency, I guess at 45%, and you had indicated that EMS growth should moderate, effectively, you\u2019re saying that the consumption piece of Azure might accelerate in the September quarter. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. Is this as simple as prior period commitments ramping at an accelerated pace? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. I think, in general, you\u2019ve got the right trajectory. And I do think it\u2019s both things. You\u2019ve heard me say, it\u2019s both some of our core as well as premium SKUs. We\u2019ve seen some nice execution. And I think Satya mentioned some of these differentiated places in the Azure stack, where I think we also can see some growth. Data services is a very good point where I feel like we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, have a real differentiation, have seen some acceleration in the past couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan.\nMark Moerdler: Satya, at the Ignite Conference a few months ago, you commented that cloud architectures have reached peak centralization. I\u2019m wondering what developments are you seeing that inform your viewpoint. And Amy, do you sense uplift in some of those intelligent edge products such as Azure Stack or others contributing to the improvement in server products growth that we saw this quarter?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks so much for that question. A couple of things that are happening. One is that all up, even what we consider the cloud infrastructure is getting increasingly distributed. If you think about the approach we took to our data center architecture, the fact that we have more regions, is to meet, I would say, both the real-world needs for the computing architecture side but also the regulatory and data residency requirements. So, we feel we picked the right approach. And that\u2019s paying dividends today just even in terms of our geographic coverage, our coverage of all of the regulatory requirements. Then, the second piece, of course, is distributed computing will remain distributed. And what we are seeing with edge is going to be the case where we will see more of both the old workloads with hybrid benefits and hybrid deployments as well as new workloads, right? So, if you take the AB InBev Digital Twin meets IoT type of scenario, that\u2019s going to require a lot more compute close to their factories. And so, to me, those new scenarios -- or 5G, I mean, think about what AT&T is planning to do, which is a hybrid deployment in a completely new space where there is going to be compute that\u2019s located to be able to take core network traffic and use cloud economics. So, that\u2019s what we think of going forward, which is really compute will remain distributed, both because of their needs across geographies, regulation and the very nature of compute architecture.\nAmy Hood: And to the question you asked on how to think about the edge and where to see that in results, really, it shows up. This is one where I would focus on the overall server products and cloud services number, which I think, Mark, was at the heart of your question because through our purchasing vehicles, the most effective way to purchase for flexibility with and across the edge in the cloud is sometimes some of the on-prem licensing with hybrid rights. So, you do see that both in our Azure results but also depending on how it\u2019s purchased and server KPI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: A question for you really around $10 million-plus contracts. You called out momentum this quarter and last quarter. My question is around the drivers of these large enterprise commitments. Is this driven by just the larger scope of deals, or are you seeing kind of broader attach rate across the whole breadth of Microsoft Cloud products? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Maybe, Satya, I\u2019ll take this one first and if you want to add anything. Brent, unfortunately, I\u2019m going to answer it\u2019s everything, and let me talk about why I say that. When you see the size of the contracts increase, it\u2019s about the entire scope of what\u2019s offered under the Microsoft Cloud. We\u2019re seeing both really strong renewals of our core contracts, really strong additions across Dynamics, Power Apps, Power Automate, M365, premium SKUs, security, compliance, voice, which, of course, increases those commitment sizes. And you\u2019re seeing the addition of Azure commitments, which we often talk about as these multiyear longer-term contracts. And so, then you do, of course, see them just have longer duration on -- especially in the case of Azure. So, in many ways, what we focus on are the components that make up the larger contracts is each component being additive to selling the value that\u2019s present across all of our pieces of the Microsoft Cloud. And this was a good execution quarter for us. You see it in the bookings number even more. When you have a declining expiry base and then bookings growth that\u2019s that high you have to do all those things well. And that\u2019s I think really what\u2019s reflected ultimately and transactionally, meaning those larger $10 million-plus contracts being done.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: I guess my main question maybe for Satya, you\u2019ve taken -- you\u2019ve noted the future of work having changed, and you talked about the fusion of Teams into both, the application stack, the operating system stack and really amongst the entire Microsoft portfolio. Is that driving -- given the acceleration you\u2019re seeing in Dynamics, can you talk to the fact, is that driving larger deals, new bites at the apple, or how is that changing the landscape? And how do you think about that versus what your competitors are doing?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. Thanks for that. Multiple things happening and both -- some of them are independent secular growth trends and they do reinforce each other. Let\u2019s just take Dynamics. It\u2019s probably one of the most exciting things we are seeing is that coming out of this pandemic, there is an absolute new chapter for a complete new suite all the way from whether it\u2019s sales, to customer service, to marketing, to supply chain, or digital manufacturing, that\u2019s all going to be re-implemented. So, there\u2019s going to be a complete new cycle of business process automation that is going to be AI-first and collaboration-first. And that second part is where that intersection between Teams and Business Process or Dynamics comes through, because you do not want to have a system of record for anything, whether it is a customer or a part or a forecast that you don\u2019t want to collaborate on, that you don\u2019t want to communicate on. And by the way, the communications and the collaboration artifacts are part of the record. And that\u2019s what I think that this new generation of software will enable. And so, you see it in two fronts. One is, Teams has become a platform, not just for Dynamics, even for Salesforce, for SAP, for Adobe, for ServiceNow. They\u2019re all building great integrations into Teams and we\u2019ll foster that. And Dynamics itself of course will integrate deeply with Teams and embed Teams or Azure Communication Services. So, when you think about our omnichannel customer service module, it doesn\u2019t look like anything that -- from two years ago. It\u2019s a completely rebuilt omnichannel customer service system, which has all the communication functionality built in. So, it\u2019s a pretty exciting space. And it also speaks to a lot of the questions around where is the margin, how is it going to sort of evolve? I think tracking what\u2019s happening with Power Platform, Dynamics and Teams, I think probably and its intersection to even some of our data layers in Azure is perhaps the best indication of some of our competitive differentiation at scale already.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: Amy, I wanted to direct this to you and go back to margins for a second. Is there any comments or color that you could provide? I know you said you focused on the operating margin side, but on the trends that you anticipate this year in \u201822 around gross margins with or without the depreciation schedules. Part B is, on the last quarter call, you indicated that operating expenses might grow kind of mid-teens or low teens, I should say, in \u201822. I was wondering if you would want to update the comments on how we should be thinking about operating expense trends as we look at FY22. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Keith. When I think about your operating expense comments, no, I don\u2019t have any update to that. I think if you think about our headcount growth at 12%, plus through the year, continuing to invest in some of the places where we saw savings through the year on COVID, I would expect that that is still a good placeholder for people as we work through the year. I mean, with the opportunity we see in the market, I think it supports that level. And given our execution, when we do invest, which leads me to margin, I feel very good about that. At the gross margin level, we\u2019ll continue I feel very good always focused on, which is continuing across our cloud services to see improving margins. You\u2019ll continue to see a mix shift to Azure, given the growth we expect there. And we\u2019ll continue to see gross margin improvements across individual services that make up many of our components across the Company. So, in general, I feel like the gross margin trends are quite healthy heading into \u201822.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. So, that wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, everyone.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter powered by our continued strength of our commercial cloud. Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating and it's just the beginning. Digital technology will be the foundation for resilience and growth over the next decade. We are innovating and building the cloud stack to accelerate the digital capability of every organization on the planet. Now, I'll highlight our growing opportunity and momentum starting with Azure. As the world's COGS become more digital, computing will become more ubiquitous and decentralized. We are building Azure to address organizations' needs in a multi-cloud multi-edge world. We have more data center regions than any other provider, including new regions in China, Indonesia, Malaysia as well as United States. Azure has always been hybrid by design and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premise, multi-cloud, and the edge and they're going further with Arc-enabled machine learning and Arc-enabled Kubernetes. Companies like Fujitsu and KPMG are using Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure data services anywhere. Our differentiation across the cloud and the edge is driving deeper and more strategic partnerships with leading companies in every industry from Total and Repsol and Energy to Kaiser Permanente in healthcare and Amadeus in travel. Now to data and analytics. Core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to turn data into predictive and analytical power. The next-generation analytics service, Azure Synapse, accelerates time to insight by bringing together, data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics into one unified service. No other provider offers the limitless scale, price performance and deep integrations of Synapse. With Spark integration, for example, organizations can handle large-scale data processing workloads. With Azure machine learning, they can build advanced AI models. With Power BI, anyone in the organization can access insights. We are seeing adoption from thousands of customers, including AB InBev, Dentsu and Swiss Re. Queries performed using Synapse have increased 105% over the last quarter alone. We are leading in hyperscale SQL and non-SQL databases to support the increasing volume variety and velocity of data. Customers continue to choose Azure for their relational database workloads with SQL Server on Azure VMs use, up 129% year-over-year. And Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Transaction volume increased 170% year-over-year. Now on to developers. As every organization looks to build its own digital capability, they will need to modernize existing apps, build new apps and have a standard way of doing both. We offer the most popular tools to help developers rapidly grow from idea to code and code to cloud. Visual Studio has more than 25 million monthly active users and GitHub is home to nearly 65 million developers. Over the past 12 months, the number of monthly active organizations using GitHub increased 70%. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking technological achievements of the past year, including critical COVID-19 vaccine trials, as well as the first powered flight on Mars were only possible because of the contributions of the open-source communities on GitHub. At the PaaS layer, we are innovating to help developers infuse AI into the solutions they build. Large-scale AI models are becoming platforms and we've seen dramatic advances in research and development by OpenAI whose models are trained and hosted exclusively on Azure. GPT-3 is generating 4.5 billion words per day on average with hundreds of apps in production across a range of industries. With Azure Cognitive Services, organizations can build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate decision-making. New capabilities enable developers to add semantic search to their apps and help companies like AT&T, Duolingo and Progressive build custom neural voices for their products. And we're doing -- going further with Azure Percept, a complete platform from silicon to service, which simplifies the process of developing, training and deploying AI at the edge. As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse comprised of digital twins, simulated environments and mixed reality is emerging as a first-class platform. We are leading and seeing traction across public and private sector. Bentley Systems is building a digital twin of the city of Dublin to reimagine urban planning used our Azure Digital Twins as well as Azure IoT. PepsiCo is simulating its manufacturing processes to improve product consistency using our autonomous systems platform. And from Airbus and Toyota to L'Oreal and Intel, customers in every industry are transcending space and addressing complex challenges using mixed reality. The U.S. Army, for example, will use HoloLens-based headset augmented with our cloud services. The new Microsoft Mesh builds on this momentum allowing for holographic interactions with true presence in a natural way on any device. We've already seen early adoption by Accenture, which is using mesh to build immersive virtual office experiences. Power Platform is becoming the next-generation business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in all functions. We have taken a unique approach to what is an expansive and high-growth TAM, bringing together robotic process automation, low-code, no-code tools, virtual agents and business intelligence. Using power platform and domain -- any domain experts can automate a workflow, create an app, build a virtual agent or analyze data rapidly driving productivity gains across the organization through smart automation. Just like Office-revolutionized productivity gains for knowledge workers, Power Platform will do the same for domain experts. All up Power, Platform is being used by nearly 16 million monthly active users, up 97% year-over-year. Revenue increased 84% year-over-year. Telstra, T-Mobile, Toyota North America and Unilever have all built centers of excellence for Power Platform with thousands of workers who are using those low-code, no-code tools to build apps and workflows for everything from COVID-19 screening to product quality control. In robotic process automation, Coca-Cola saved months of development time by integrating Power Automate with legacy systems to automate shipment verification, payroll processing and much more. And in analytics, Daimler chose Power BI to surface insights across the organization, while maintaining the highest levels of security. Now on to business applications. Dynamics 365 had a breakthrough quarter as companies turn to intelligent business applications to adapt and grow. Revenue increased 45% as we continue to take share from competition. We are adding capabilities across Dynamics 365 to address organization's most pressing challenges. New integrations with Teams make it simple to meet, chat, call and collaborate directly within Dynamics 365. A new Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management helps company\u2019s support omnichannel fulfillment. We are seeing increased adoption of Dynamics 365 across every industry from ABN AMRO in Financial Services to BMW in automotive. More broadly across the Microsoft Cloud, we are leading with industry and cross-industry solutions and expanding our investments to help organizations use our complete tech stack along with industry specific customizations to improve time to value, increase agility and lower costs. This quarter we introduced new industry clouds for financial services, manufacturing and nonprofits, building on the momentum of existing clouds for health care and retail. And our pending acquisition of Nuance will bring our solutions directly into the physician patient loop, which is central to health care delivery. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as LinkedIn's 756 million members use the network to connect, learn, create content, and find jobs. Conversations increased 43%, content share was up 29%, and the hours on LinkedIn increased by 80%. We are helping creators use LinkedIn to expand their economic opportunity, thousands of expert instructors are monetizing their content on LinkedIn Learning. Freelancers can now attract clients with dedicated pages. And with the creator mode, members can build a following and engaged communities. In a world facing a growing skills gap, we are helping employers create feedback loops between skills, learning, credentials, and jobs. 60% of the Fortune 500 use LinkedIn Learning to skill and upskill their employees. Nationwide Insurance, for example, is using LinkedIn Learning to provide personalized curriculum to 26,000 associates. And new tools bring together courses with skills assessments helping companies like BlackRock, Gap and TaskRabbit source job candidates based on proven proficiencies. Businesses continue to turn to LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions revenue was up more than 60% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months revenue has surpassed $3 billion and is growing nearly three times faster than the B2B digital advertising market. Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work will require a new operating model. That's why we built Teams as the organizing layer for all the way people work, learn, and collaborate. Teams now has over 145 million daily active users, almost double the number a year ago. In markets where employees have returned to the workplace including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan we have seen usage continue to grow. And the number of organizations with more than 1,000 users integrating their third-party and line of business applications with Teams has increased nearly 3x year-over-year. We're accelerating our innovation, adding more than 300 features over the past year including more than a hundred new capabilities so far in 2021. New inclusive meeting experience for hybrid work including custom gallery views enable anyone to be seen, heard and participate whether they are at-home, in a meeting room, at an office or on a factory floor. And customers like GM and Sanofi are using Teams for unified communications including for voice. Teams is extending beyond communications, creating an entirely new category of modern collaborative applications as organizations use Power Platform to build custom apps, bots and workflows within teams. American Airlines, for example, highlighted in their earnings call the cost savings it's driving by using a Power app within Teams to help their frontline workers manage critical data operations. Teams is transforming not only internal collaboration, but companies how they do business. We added support for shared workspaces with people outside the organization and we are seeing Teams used for everything from virtual retail showrooms and personal shopping to interactive webinars. We introduced Microsoft Viva this quarter creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva brings together knowledge, learning, communication and insights in an integrated experience directly within Teams and Microsoft 365. Companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever will use Viva to help their employees thrive in a new era of hybrid work. All up Microsoft 365 users generated more than 38 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter. Office 365 now has nearly 300 million paid seats. And organizations across the private and public sector like the City of Helsinki, Bausch Health, Stryker are increasingly choosing our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance voice and analytics. People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever to stay connected productive and secure. Windows 10 now has more than 1.3 billion monthly active devices and Microsoft 365 consumer surpassed 50 million subscribers for the first time. Now on to security. The threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging and security has never been more critical to our customers. This is driving increased demand for our end-to-end capabilities across identity, security compliance and management backed by cloud-scale AI and human expertise encompassing all clouds and all platforms. What differentiates us and drives customer value is the interconnection between identity endpoint apps, cloud data and infrastructure across our cloud-native XDR and SIEM. All informed by our operational security posture, which analyzes more than eight trillion signals each day. Our approach enables organizations to adopt a Zero Trust architecture, while also reducing the complexity cost and risk created by stitching together point solutions. That's why more than 400,000 customers use our offerings including many of the world's most established firms like Boston Consulting Group, HCA Healthcare, Lowe's and UBS. And Signal is using Azure Confidential Computing to protect the data and use for its millions of customers. We are going further to help protect organizations. We are delivering on our ambition to eliminate passwords introducing password-less sign-in to Azure AD. Our Azure AD paid customer base has more than doubled year-over-year to over 300,000, new capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender help organizations better understand, prevent and mitigate active threats. Defender has blocked 30 billion threats on e-mail and nearly seven billion on endpoints over the past 12 months alone. And our compliance manager now offers more than 300 out-of-the-box assessments for regulations such as GDPR. Now on to gaming. We're expanding our opportunity as we help both gamers and creators play, connect and build across communities on any device. People are turning to Xbox more than ever to play and chat with friends and we saw record engagement this quarter led by the strength on and off console. With Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed. Just last week we added cloud gaming via the browser expanding our reach across PC and mobile. Content is the flywheel behind the services growth. And upon the closing of our acquisition of ZeniMax Media this quarter we made 20 of the world's most iconic and beloved games accessible via Game Pass with more to come. As games evolve into metaverse economies, we are building new tools to help anyone sell creations on our platform. Minecraft is nearly 140 million monthly active users up 30% year-over-year making it one of the leading platforms in the creator economy. Creators have generated over $350 million from more than one billion downloads of mods, add-ons and other experiences in Minecraft. This is not counting and including activity outside of our marketplace. We are also seeing a vibrant marketplace emerge in Flight Simulator with partners now able to sell content directly within the game. In closing, we're innovating across the entire tech stack as we differentiate and lead in areas that will be critical to the success of every customer going forward. I'm optimistic about our opportunity ahead. With that I'll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. My comments today reflect the impact of the ZeniMax acquisition for approximately three weeks this quarter as well as our outlook. There is no impact from the Nuance acquisition that is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Our third quarter revenue was $41.7 billion, up 19% and 16% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.95 and increased 39% and 34% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit related to the recent India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. Many trends across industries, customer segments, and geographical markets continued to improve, which coupled with strong execution by our sales and partner teams, drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. In our commercial business accelerating digital transformation enabled by our unique Microsoft Cloud value, drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings. Strong Azure consumption, increased platform commitments, and higher usage of Teams Power Platform and our security offerings were key beneficiaries. Within our small and medium business customer segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends more than offset transactional licensing weakness. And in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, annual contracts and job postings improved with the job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions benefited from a much stronger than expected PC market despite significant ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Improvement in the advertising market again benefited our Search and LinkedIn businesses and in gaming, we continue to see record engagement and strong monetization across our platform as well as demand that significantly exceeded supply for Xbox Series X and S consoles. Moving to our overall results, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations increasing 39% and 38% in constant currency on a growing expiration base and low prior year comparable. Growth was driven by consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $117 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months and our annuity mix increased two points year-over-year to 94%. Commercial cloud revenue also better than expected grew 33% and 29% in constant currency to $17.7 billion. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded three points year-over-year to 70%, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly with improvement in Azure gross margin mostly offset by sales mix shift to Azure. With a weaker US dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately three points about one point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS and operating expense growth by approximately two points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 69% relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly one point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down, driven by strong revenue growth in cloud and gaming that resulted in sales mix shift. Operating expense increased 5% and 3% in constant currency, lower than anticipated, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter up 12% year-over-year, reflecting our focused investments across key areas like cloud engineering, sales, and customer deployment. Year-over-year growth in operating expense includes roughly two points of impact from continued COVID-related savings. Operating income increased 31% and 27% in constant currency and operating margins expanded four points year-over-year to 41% including nearly two points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and roughly one point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $13.6 billion and grew 15% and 12% in constant currency, primarily driven by Office 365 and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 14% and 10% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 22% and 19% in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our high-value security, compliance and voice offerings drove strong momentum in E5 again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 15% year-over-year to nearly $300 million with acceleration to the cloud in our small and medium business segment and a recovery in growth in our first-line worker offerings. The accelerated cloud adoption, negatively impacted Office Commercial licensing, which declined 25% and 27% in constant currency, a bit below expectations. In Office Consumer, revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, primarily due to transactional weakness in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to $50.2 million, up 27% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 26% and 22% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth accelerating to 45% and 40% in constant currency with particular strength in Power Apps in our finance and operations offering. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Our Marketing Solutions business accelerated again this quarter to 64% revenue growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 4% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 26% and 20% in constant currency including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $15.1 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Azure revenue grew 50% and 46% in constant currency, better than anticipated, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based business. And in our per user business growth in our Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base accelerated again this quarter, up 30% to over 174 million seats. And on a strong prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premise's server business increased 3% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with strong annuity performance, driven by continued customer preference for our hybrid and premium offerings. Enterprise Services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% to 24% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 12% and 10% in constant currency and operating income grew 41% and 36% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13 billion increasing 19% and 16% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in gaming, Windows OEM and Search. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 10%, driven by continued customer demand. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 44% and OEM Pro revenue declined 2% on a prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 10% and 7% in constant currency with a lower-than-expected mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 12% and 7% in constant currency lower than expected, primarily due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 17% and 14% in constant currency benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier.  And in Gaming, revenue increased 50% and 48% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 232% and 223% in constant currency driven by our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue, which now includes ZeniMax grew 34% and 32% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance of first-party titles, particularly Minecraft.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased two points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming. Operating expense decreased 3% and 4% in constant currency and operating income grew 27% and 22% in constant currency.  Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6 billion in line with expectations driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand from increased customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.2 billion and increased 27% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.1 billion, up 24%. Other income and expense was $188 million higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 14%. And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Now let's move to the outlook. As a reminder in Q4, we begin to see growth rates that reflect the first full quarter impact of COVID-19 a year ago both across revenue and operating expenses. Last year across Windows, OEM, Gaming and Surface we saw surges in purchasing and usage that will negatively impact Q4 growth rates.  In our Search and LinkedIn businesses, Q4 growth rates will be positively impacted given the advertising and job markets a year ago. And in our transactional business, the slowdown in purchasing in Office and Server last year will benefit Q4 growth rates, particularly in our small and medium business segment.  Next in our largest quarter of the year, we expect the accelerating trends Satya discussed, our differentiated market position and continued solid execution to results in another strong quarter. Growth in commercial bookings should again be healthy, but impacted by a declining expiry base. As always, an increasing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive quarterly volatility in bookings.  Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should increase roughly four points year-over-year with less than two points from the change in accounting estimate. As a reminder, the favorable impact continues to lessen over time. Excluding the accounting change, Q4 gross margin percentage will also benefit a bit from investments we made a year ago to support increased usage needs in remote work scenarios.  Longer term commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our productivity and collab solutions and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.  Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately three points, More Personal Computing revenue and total operating expense growth by approximately two points and COGS growth by approximately one point.  Next to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.8 billion and $14.05 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth and upsell opportunity to E5.  In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect mid to high teens revenue growth driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions against the low prior year comparable impacted by the transactional purchasing weakness noted earlier.  In LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30% range, driven by continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets. And in Dynamics, continued momentum in Dynamics 365 will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.45 billion. In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable and the transactional purchasing noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, revenue growth to be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.6 billion and $14 billion. In Windows, overall revenue should grow mid-single digits driven by Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth and continued demand for PCs, partially offset by ongoing supply chain impacts and the comparable noted earlier. In Surface on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-teens as we work through the supply chain and executing challenges noted earlier. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid-40s driven by improvements in the advertising market. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digits. Significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S will continue to be constrained by supply. And on the strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid- to high single-digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.7 billion to $13.9 billion and operating expense of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. As a reminder, in operating expense in Q4, we will benefit from continued COVID-related savings as well as the prior year comparable, which included roughly four points of impact from a $450 million charge related to the realignment of our retail store strategy. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to next fiscal year. Overall, we have performed well through three quarters of our fiscal year in a challenging environment, and we fully expect a strong Q4 to lay the foundation for FY 2022. We will, of course, continue to focus on delivering strong revenue growth in the short term. But even more importantly, this year has reinforced the critical importance of investing boldly to capture the significant list of opportunities ahead of us. Excellence in daily execution, coupled with a thoughtful vision for the future that creates value as well as opportunity for our customers globally will lead to long-term revenue and profit growth. With that, Brett, let's go to Q&A.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and great quarter. I guess this is a question both for Satya and Amy. We're seeing these really great commercial bookings results come through 39% growth in the current quarter. And Satya, you've been talking to us a lot about these more strategic deals and the acceleration of digital transformation. Can you give us a little bit of color of what comes in these more strategic deals? How does it change the dynamics of what types of solutions people are using for Microsoft, the scope of sort of how deeply you're getting into these customers and sort of how much of the IT budget you're getting? And then maybe talk to us a little bit about the timeframe for which this comes into revenues. What should our expectation be when you get one of these big strategic deals? How long does it take to really ramp up this customer onto the broader Microsoft platform?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for the question. I think we feel very good both, I would say, of consumption and usage today, as well as, as you mentioned, the bookings because both of those at any given point in time is what we look at. The overall approach to the Microsoft Cloud, if you look at the breadth of what any customer may be doing with us, they may be doing hybrid cloud infrastructure with us. They may be, for the first time, doing Tier 1 workloads on the cloud with us, right, whether it's in core financials or in retail or in health care. Also they could be deploying their centers of excellence around Power Platform. And Power Platform sits at the intersection of pretty much Dynamics, Azure and Teams, for example. And of course, we're seeing the growth of Teams and Teams, as I've always maintained, is not just about one thing. It's not about just meetings or it's not about just chat. But most importantly, it's a platform that drives in fact line of business and business application termination inside of a collaboration workflow. And so that's what we're seeing. And then the other thing I would say that we are now seeing is also that industry level differentiation of the all-up Microsoft cloud. So whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare or in financial services, we feel that we now can bring the power of the entire cloud together in a much more strategic way.\nAmy Hood: And maybe just to build on what Satya was saying, Keith, if you think about bookings or the remaining performance obligation, what I tend to think of is, when you hear those words, I think, often we pivot toward these Azure contracts we talk a lot about because they create some volatility. But really, the foundation for these long-term strategic contracts is the Microsoft Cloud holistically. So what you'll see is not just Office 365, but the suite of Microsoft 365. You'll see higher-level additions of security or compliance workloads. You'll see Dynamics 365 as a pillar with Power Platform, because they're spanning end-to-end industry solutions to combine it back to what Satya is saying. So you see it add a good bookings number, which is fundamentally about, do you renew what's up for renewal, do you add workloads, do you add users and do you -- and does it have a component of an Azure commitment. All of those things together are what creates this change. And if you look at remaining performance obligation, you see there a good bit of it, that's going to be recognized in the next 12 months and another equally balanced portion that's beyond that. So it's not all long-term. This transition happens quickly, usage builds, it's both per user, it's also for workload and it's consumptive based. So it's really a more holistic view that I would have people take as opposed to thinking about an Azure contract as long dated.\nKeith Weiss: Okay, Amy. Thank you, guys.\nBrett Iversen: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Satya, on healthcare, if you could just frame your aspirations long-term, where you'd like to be in this industry? And if you could just comment on where you still think the lowest hanging fruit is as it relates to the opportunity set, specifically building on the Nuance acquisition?\nSatya Nadella: Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. When I look at the industry cloud opportunities, we think of healthcare is a very critical opportunity for us and a huge and expansive addressable market. If you think about as a percentage of GDP, obviously, healthcare is significant. And fundamentally, when I think about the provider market, in particular, digital tech is going to play a huge role for every provider to do the things that they care the most about, which is improve the patient outcomes and reduce cost and reduce the burden on the physicians. So that's where the Nuance acquisition is a great fit for us. We've been partnered with them. It also enhances our platform approach, Brent. What we have always done has gone into an industry with a platform and an ecosystem approach. For example, with Nuance, they've done a fantastic job of taking what's perhaps the most defining technology of our times, which is AI and applying it to healthcare, which is the most important application space. And they've done that again by really partnering, partnering deeply with EMR systems and the rest of the healthcare ecosystem ultimately to benefit the providers. And so we're really looking forward to that acquisition closing and we're already partnered with them in our cloud. But this allows us to take that and integrate more deeply with what we're doing with Teams and some of our AI capabilities even more deeply. And we think we can add a significant amount of value both to our partners in the healthcare ecosystem as well as most importantly to the providers.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and again congratulations on the quarter and how well the company is executing. I'd like to change gear a little bit and drill in a bit on the Dynamics 365 business. Frankly, was this part of any other company or even a standalone business, it would be such a center of enthusiasm by investors given how fast it's grown. Satya, when you said Dynamics 365 is taking share from competitors, are you talking about ERP or CRM or is it both? Or is it something different? And what are the key drivers of that strength and growth? And how sustainable do you believe that is? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks so much for the question, Mark. And first of all, we're very, very excited about what's happening again with Dynamics 365. And when you ask where is the share coming and where is the growth coming? It's coming from all those categories. But the most interesting thing is, as somebody wants to deploy even an omni-channel solution, for example, in a world where what's physical and what is digital need to come together, unlike anything before because the pandemic is bringing about such structural change. You need both, that federated inventory management, distributed inventory management system I referenced in my remarks. And you need the customer insights product that is probably one of the fastest-growing modules, which is that 360-degree view on customers and customer engagement and then including the supply chain. So bottom line is that, every customer is looking to digitize and bring together the data silos, in fact, silos of CRM and ERP systems. And that's probably one of the most interesting things we have observed is, it's not about replacing even an existing ERP or an existing CRM, it's about buying Dynamics and helping them bridge even some of the disparate CRM and ERP systems they may have. So we do see this, as a huge opportunity as the world modernizes and puts in a complete next-generation, more proactive versus reactive business systems. And that's what Dynamics has been architected for. So I feel like coming out of this pandemic and the architecture and all the hard work that team has done over the multiple years now, positions us very well.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. I much appreciate it.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Mark. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks. Question for Amy on OpEx. Amy the OpEx growth has been extraordinarily low the last several quarters. The growth rate looks like it's going to inch up a little bit in the June quarter. But you mentioned the investments are shifting to future quarters. You probably don't want to give too much on fiscal 2022. But I'm just wondering whether we should extrapolate that into thinking that OpEx growth in fiscal 2022 should get back to the pre-COVID levels of plus 10%. And if you don't want to be that specific, maybe you could just help us outline some of the variables we should keep in mind as we model that line item post-COVID recovery in fiscal 2022? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks Karl. And I do think in Q4, and its why, I specifically called out the four points of impact from a year ago because it does start to get to a more normalized rate in Q4. And I say that, because our headcount growth which I noted earlier has been 12%. And so, overall, you would expect, OpEx growth to at least marry your headcount growth over any period of time and we've certainly benefited through the year from COVID-related savings. We'll continue to have that in Q4. And as we get to 2022, I would expect to see a little less of that as people get back to the workplace at some level and resume some other normal levels of activity. And so, I do think, you're heading in the right direction on that. And listen, I think that type of growth with the type of opportunity we're seeing, the number of TAM expansive opportunities really Satya went through in his comments, where we feel like we've got a unique position and opportunity to take share. I feel pretty confident in being able to certainly land that OpEx growth number.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Thank you, Amy.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl.\nSatya Nadella: I mean, I think just to add to it, Amy, I think I hope in all of your models you have new rows at least when we think about it from even just last year to this year, we are in many more new categories and in those categories with significant differentiation. So when we think about OpEx, it's not about adding OpEx to the stuff that we had in the past. It's -- there's leverage there. In fact it's OpEx going into new TAMs.\nBrett Iversen : Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Satya, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about Viva. I realize it's early days on that. But just the kind of feedback you're getting on that product? And how do you see that sort of fitting in? There seem to be some nice adjacencies with Dynamics with Office 365. So I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little bit of a hand on how it's going and sort of your excitement level about it over the next quarter next couple of years? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you so much for the question. It's speaks a lot. It's very much a great example of what I was saying in terms of creating a new category right. When I look back multiple years now, we started talking about Power Platform. And as I said even in my script today, we now have a full suite of tools that essentially created this next-generation business, process automation and productivity suite in Power Platform that set scale and growing at scale. Similarly, we think of the experience cloud as a distinct cloud opportunity for us. It brings together even today what have been disparate tools, whether it's the knowledge mining and management systems in an enterprise, connecting it to learnings and ultimately the employee experience and communication system. So we -- it obviously is a very massive adjacencies to what we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 in particular Teams. But also to your point connects up with line of business systems, HRM systems and all of the other things we do in Dynamics as well as other third-party SaaS applications. So it's very early days. And so we'll take the same approach we have taken, whether it's in Security, whether it's in Power Platform, whether it's Dynamics and many other places where you've seen us grow substantial new businesses essentially as part of Microsoft Cloud. But we're very excited about what this opportunity represents.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen : Thanks, Kirk. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. Satya, I know, you've said that you expect tech as a percentage of GDP to track about 5% or roughly double over the next 10 years or so. How should we think about Microsoft's share in that context? Is it going to be steady? Or do you see that expanding? And if it is going to expand, what are the key products and markets that will drive your relative share growth as you outperform tech and as tech outperforms GDP. Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: No, thanks Kash for the question. I think that, first of all, we are big believers in two things. One is, we need to be competitive in each layer and then the coming together of each layer into a cohesive coherent architecture of the full stack or the Microsoft cloud creates that differentiation. And that will define what we think is going to be increasing share for us, as tech itself as a percentage of GDP doubles. So if you look at it -- whether it's on the hybrid infrastructure or the multi-cloud, multi-edge world, which I believe is going to be the world 10 years from now, we are very well positioned. We have led in it we currently lead in it and we plan to continue that. When it comes to data when I look at even what we've been able to do with Synapse even in the just last year and what that can do both at the cloud and the edge. When it comes to AI what we are doing with OpenAI and our cognitive services or what we're doing with Power Platform. Developer SaaS one of the most exciting things again, that I believe is the next 10 years is going to be about developers and the digital capability in every enterprise and we are the leaders there. When you think about VS Code as well as GitHub. And then, of course, all of the things that we're doing with Microsoft 365 and Dynamics on the industry side. So, ultimately, we don't take anything for granted. But that said, we're well positioned for what is expansive TAM and with competitive differentiation both in the individual layers of the stack as well as the cohesiveness of the stack itself.\nKash Rangan: Got it. Thank you so much. That just sound like a share gain story. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. \nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, very much for taking the question. Satya, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about an increase in verticalization of Azure. Can we double click on that a bit more? How much incremental opportunity do you see in industries like financials, like manufacturing? And are there other verticals that may make sense to more as we pursue over time as well?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you for the question. We absolutely think that ultimately, customers are looking to increase their time to value lower cost and improve agility. So being able to customize these workflows, to come up with industry schemers because when you think about increased digitization and workflow automation, it does take that next level of schematization of what is perhaps today not digital inside an industry. And so therefore, what we do by stitching together, coming together of even Microsoft 365, Teams, Power Platform with certain workflows, with data inside of Azure, as well as Dynamics, that absolutely improves the ability for any customer in any one of these industries to improve their time to value. So yes, it is going to both help us with adoption rates increase, the speed with which it increases and it also differentiates us. And we'll continue to look. And one of the other things that we're doing is it's not just one industry at a time. It's also the cross-industry workflows. So we absolutely believe that that -- we already talk about not just any individual part of our cloud, we talk about only one thing, it's called the Microsoft Cloud. And now we're increasingly talking about Microsoft Cloud by industry and cross industry.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Gregg. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about security and what we see in terms of changes of the industry and how Microsoft is kind of fit in there where, obviously in the last quarter, that was kind of a big topic. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of customers realizing the broadened offering from Microsoft and how the cloud is playing a changing role there? Thank you. \nSatya Nadella: No. Thank you for the question. Obviously, security is a super important topic for every customer, every board, every executive team. And the fundamental approach we have is, how do we ensure that every customer has implemented a zero trust architecture. But that's the name of the game which is, how can Microsoft through participation in the security industry, accelerate essentially the cyber defense of the entire digital factor and beyond. And so to me, what we have done is taken a pretty unique approach of bringing identity, endpoint application, infrastructure all together with XDR and SIM, which is cloud native. That's pretty unique because we really don't let the get in the way. We'll make sure that any customer who is able to sort of deploy these systems together has more defense in depth, but also the aggregate data to be able to detect and respond to any intrusion because that's sort of the key posture. And then you couple that with our operational security posture when you're processing 8 trillion events and using that to continuously help our customers is increasing to your point, the cloud adoption rate. So if you look at some of the challenges like HAFNIUM, the cloud was not impacted. And when we did sort of a lot of work to make sure that the patches were out even for servers that were out of support for multiple years. And so -- but at the same time, any business that had moved already to the cloud had none of those issues. So, therefore, I think we are going to see increased cloud adoption. We're going to see increased usage of end-to-end security suites like what we offer. And most importantly, great hygiene and great operational security posture all the time with zero trust architecture.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you all.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike. It was a record quarter driven by our commercial cloud, which surpassed $16 billion in revenue, up 34% year-over-year. What we are witnessing is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry. Digital capability is key to both resilience and growth. It's no longer enough to just adopt technology. Businesses need to build their own technology to compete and grow. Microsoft is powering the shift with the world's largest and most comprehensive cloud platform. And now I'll briefly highlight how we are innovating across every layer of the modern tech stack starting with Azure. We are building Azure as the world's computer to support organizations growing cloud needs. We are investing to bring our cloud services to more customers announcing seven new data center regions in Asia, Europe and Latin America and adding support for top secret classified workloads in the United States. We've always led in hybrid computing and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Stack HCI, now broadly available, helps businesses extend the power of the cloud to sovereign workloads. More than thousand customers now use as Azure Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure services across on-premises, multi-cloud and at the edge. And with Azure Digital Twins organizations, like Bentley Systems, Honeywell Industries and Johnson Controls can bridge the digital and physical worlds, creating simulations of factories, cities to optimize their operations. We are seeing momentum in every industry. Deutsche Telekom rely on Azure to modernize its IT infrastructure through a partnership with Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard as well as Verily, our cloud will be used to help more researchers analyze biomedical data. Cruise and GM chose Azure as their preferred cloud as they work to make autonomous driving mainstream. And just last Friday, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP to accelerate the adoption of SAP workloads on Azure. In the past six months, we've seen Tier 1 ERP migrations from companies such as Bayer, Carhartt, Coats and PepsiCo to Azure. At the data layer, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that enable organizations to build the predictive and analytical path required to digitally transform. Azure Synapse brings together big data, data warehousing and data integration all into one powerful solution. Leading companies like FedEx, Grab and P&G are using Synapse to generate immediate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data and we are seeing strong overall growth in our analytics business as companies accelerate their data initiatives to build competitive advantage. Data governance is top of mind for every business leader and will grow into an important category on its own as critical as any AI or analytics category today. We are investing to participate in this growth. New Azure Purview provides an end-to-end view of an organization's data estate across on-premise, multi-cloud and SaaS apps that previously was impossible. In AI, we offer the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks and infrastructure, enabling businesses to build mission-critical solutions that comprehend speech, understand natural language, make predictions, provide insights, and support decision-making. Our Azure Health Bot, for example, is being used by organizations like the CDC, Premera Blue Cross, and Walgreens to build virtual healthcare assistants used by more than 80 million people worldwide at a time when expanding access to healthcare information is more critical than ever. Now to developers. Developers have been critical to business continuity over the last year, and we\u2019re helping them collaborate and scale their impact to drive organizational outcomes. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most widely used and loved toolchain to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. Use of GitHub is becoming key to building digital capability in every company across every industry. Today, GitHub is used by more than 56 million developers, as well as 3 million organizations \u2013 from BuzzFeed and Plaid, to Marsh & McLennan, Oracle, and Volvo Car. Now to Power Platform. We are empowering domain experts, enabling anyone in any organization to build applications, automate processes, create virtual agents, and analyze data. Power Platform is the clear leader in low code/no code development, with more than 11 million monthly active users, up 95% year-over-year. Businesses like Nestle and Humana chose Power BI this quarter to help employees use data to make smarter decisions. In public sector, the city of Kobe, in Japan, is relying on Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate to keep citizens informed, building intelligent bots to answer frequently asked questions, as well as automated workflows to route inquiries. Vaccine distribution perhaps best exemplifies the critical need for digital capability across the globe, and our Vaccination Registration and Administration Solution, built on Power Platform, enables governments to manage the end-to-end process, from screening and scheduling, to administration, and follow ups. In Australia, the government of Victoria is relying on our tools to help deliver doses to more than 6 million residents, and here in the United States, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are using our capabilities. Our Return to the Workplace solution in Power Platform is also helping organizations keep workers safe and healthy when they go back to the office. And we\u2019re adding new capabilities to ensure people have verifiable, secure access to their vaccination records. Now to Dynamics 365. We are taking share as companies in every industry turn to new business applications to grow. Customer expectations are changing faster than ever before requiring near real-time visibility into trends, behavior, and needs. Our customer data platform, Customer Insights, leads its category and has helped customers unify over 2 billion customer profiles, providing a single view of interactions across marketing, sales, and e-commerce to deliver more personalized experiences. More companies are turning to our mixed reality solutions to help frontline employees connected even when they are apart. L\u2019Or\u00e9al, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and HoloLens 2 to help technicians repair equipment at factories even when they cannot travel. In retail, our applications were front and center at NRF earlier this month. Dynamics 365 Commerce now supports both B2C and B2B e-commerce, enabling retailers like Columbia Sportswear to ship inventory from stores and offer contactless payment options. PromoteIQ continues to scale rapidly, with retailers like DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods, The Home Depot, and Kroger using the platform to power their digital vendor marketing programs. Finally, our new Microsoft Cloud for Retail is bringing together our platform and tools across the shopper journey, accelerating time to value. It builds on the success of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, which is being used by organizations, including Providence, to empower clinicians to better serve patients. Now to LinkedIn. We once again saw record levels of engagement across the platform, as LinkedIn\u2019s nearly 740 million members use the network to connect, learn, and find new opportunities. Sessions increased 30%. Conversations were up 48%. And hours spent on LinkedIn Learning were up 2X, compared to a year ago. LinkedIn\u2019s advertising business had a record quarter, accounting for more than a third of LinkedIn\u2019s total revenue. LinkedIn\u2019s Marketing Solutions was up over 50%, as advertisers increasingly turn to the platform as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. Finally, we continue to benefit from the secular shift to remote selling. Businesses are using the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 to ensure salespeople have the context they need to sell remotely, while new tools help sales organizations use LinkedIn data to identify and size opportunities. Now to Microsoft 365. The pandemic has proven the PC\u2019s central role in keeping people connected, productive, and secure. We added more new devices running Windows 10 this quarter than ever before. At CES, our partners showcased new PCs designed for the new ways we work, learn, and play. And our Pluton security processor, built by AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will bring chip-to-cloud security. Flexible work is here to stay. To empower the digital workforce, organizations will need an organizing layer for all the ways people work, learn, and collaborate. That\u2019s what Microsoft 365 and Teams uniquely provide. Teams is the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration with Office and business process workflows in a secure, integrated user experience. We are seeing larger deployments. 117 organizations have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and over 2,700 organizations have over 10,000. And Teams has nearly 60 million daily active users on mobile alone. Teams enables people to collaborate both synchronously and asynchronously, retain business context, and stay in the flow of work \u2013 driving increased usage across Office 365 and Power Platform. Power Platform monthly average usage on Teams has grown 4X year-over-year, and with Microsoft Dataverse, anyone can now create and deploy custom solutions with Power Apps and intelligent bots with Power Virtual Agents directly in Teams. Teams is rapidly becoming the de facto unified communications platform of choice for every organization. New features like voice enabled channels create a more powerful and streamlined calling experience, and noise suppression and live captions with speaker attribution make meetings more accessible. At Accenture alone, audio conferencing on Teams has increased to over 1 billion minutes a month, as 85,000 employees use Teams to make external calls. And, this quarter, Lumen, formerly CenturyLink, rolled out Teams calling globally to 42,000 employees in just four weeks. The pandemic has shown the importance of empowering the two billion frontline workers around the world with the right technology. 390,000 associates at home depot will use Microsoft 365 including Yammer to foster connection and engagement across the organization and more than 500,000 employees of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including healthcare workers use Teams to collaborate. In education more than 200 million students and educators worldwide rely on Microsoft education products for remote learning and leading customers in every industry including Amgen, AT&T, Diamler, GSK and Ikea are increasingly turning to our premium offerings for advanced security compliance, voice analytics capabilities. Microsoft 365 E5 revenue has grown triple digits for the past four quarters. Now the security. The reason solarwinds attack are a stark reminder of how critical security is to our customers. We're focused on ensuring organizations deploy and maintain a zero trust fork architecture. Our end-to-end security capabilities inclusive of identity, security, compliance and management across all clouds and all client platforms have been key as we help customers strengthen their security posture and mitigate impact. Beyond our products our operational security posture and threat intelligence which analyzes 8 trillion signals each day help customers defend themselves. Over the past 12 months our security business revenue has surpassed 10 billion up more than 40%. This milestone is a testament to the deep trust organizations place in us and we will continue to invest in new capabilities across all our products and services to protect our customers. We see strong momentum in usage of our products in identity Azure 80 is more than 425 million monthly active users. In security Microsoft Defender block nearly 6 billion threats last year alone. In management we saw triple digit growth in the number of devices managed by Microsoft in June and in compliance we have seen 90% increase in our customer base year-over-year. Now onto gaming. We surpassed 5 billion in revenue for the first time in this quarter as we expand our opportunity to reach the world's three billion gamers wherever they play. The launch of Xbox series X and series S was the most successful in our history with the most devices ever sold in a launch month. Game developers are benefiting too as they turn to us to reach more players and scale the games using the power of our cloud. We exceeded $2 billion in revenue from third-party titles this quarter for the first time. We're gaining console share as gamers recognize the value of our broader ecosystem. Xbox Live has more than a 100 million monthly active users while Game Pass now has 18 million subscribers and we are transforming how games are distributed played and viewed bringing cloud gaming and game pass to iOS devices and Windows PCs over the next few months. We are pleased with the overall growth in our consumer subscriptions with Game Pass and more than 47 million Microsoft 365 personal family subscribers we have a large and growing consumer subscription business and we see significant opportunity in both of these segments as they move to services and on demand models. In closing I'm energized by our increasing momentum and the expanding opportunity fueled by the structural change brought about by the rapid adoption of digital technology. We're investing to meeting these needs in the coming decade and I'm optimistic about what's ahead. With that I'll hand it over to Amy will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. This quarter revenue was $43.1 billion up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.03 increasing 34% and 31% in constant currency. Across our business results exceeded expectations driven by strong execution and improving trend across industries, customer segments and geographical markets resulting in double digit top and bottom line growth. In our commercial business customers prioritize their digital transformation which drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings with material growth in the number of $10 million plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. We saw stronger Azure consumption as well as higher usage of Teams, Power Platform and our advanced security and compliance offerings and within our small and medium business customer segments transactional licensing trends continued to show some improvement. [indiscernible] our Windows OEM, Office consumer and a surface businesses. The advertising market continue to show improvement benefiting our search and LinkedIn businesses and in gaming, we saw record engagement and monetization across our platform as well as console demand that has significantly exceeded supply following the Xbox series X and S launches. Moving to our overall results. Even with the declining expiration base and a strong prior year comparable commercial bookings increased 19% and 11% in constant currency. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions including the Azure and Microsoft 365 momentum that earlier drove the better than expected result. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24% to 22% of constant currency to $112 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 4.0 over year to 93%. Commercial cloud revenue was $16.7 billion as growth accelerated to 34% and 32% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4.0 points year-over-year to 71% driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and networking equipment assets. Excluding this impact commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly. As a reminder revenue mix shift to Azure increased customer usage of our productivity and collaboration solutions and continue strategic investments to support customers success and the deployment of our solutions will continue to impact gross margin. With the weaker U.S. dollar FX increased revenue growth by approximately 2 points about a point more favorable than anticipated. FX had no impact on comps growth and increased operating expense growth by approximately one point both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 67% up slightly year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact company gross margin percentage was down driven by the sales mix shift to cloud and gaming. Operating expenses increased 3% and 2% constant currency lower than anticipated driven by greater than expected COVID related savings, reductions and retail store expenses and investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall company headcount grew more than 10% to year-over-year with our focused investment in key areas such as customer success, cloud engineering and sales. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency and operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 42% including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and nearly one point of variable impact from COVID related savings. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $13.4 billion increasing 13% and 11% in constant currency ahead of expectations primarily driven by office commercial and LinkedIn on a stronger prior year comparable and included roughly 3 points of benefits primarily from transactional strength in Japan. Office commercial revenue grew 11% and 9% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 21% and 20% constant currency. Results were driven installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. The strong demand for Microsoft 365 noted earlier particularly for our security, compliance and voice components drove E5 revenue growth acceleration again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15% year-over-year with strong conversion of our free trial offers. We also saw a steep growth improvement in our small and medium business and first line worker offerings. Office consumer revenue grew 7% and 6% in constant currency on a strong comparable that included roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 47.5 million up 28% year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 18% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 39% and 37% in constant currency. The number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads accelerated again this quarter. LinkedIn revenue increased 23% and 22% in constant currency significantly ahead of expectations. Growth in our marketing solutions business accelerated to 53% benefiting from the stronger advertising market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 11% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency and operating income increased 19% and 17% in constant currency, including 5 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $14.6 billion ahead of expectations increasing 23% and 22% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 50% and 48% in constant currency driven by strong growth in our consumption based business that benefited from Improvement across industries and customer segments noted earlier. Our per-user results were also better than expected driven by accelerated growth in our enterprise mobility and security installed base up 29% to over 163 million seats and on a strong prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008. Our on-premise server business increased 4% and 3% in constant currency with strong annuity performance driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium offerings. Enterprise services revenue grew 5% and 4% in constant currency again driven by premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 29% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year with roughly 3 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expenses increased 12% and 11% in constant currency and operating income grew 43% and 41% in constant currency with roughly 10% favorable impact from the change and accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.1 billion increasing 14% and 13% in constant currency and better than expected performance across all businesses. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 1% despite a strong prior year comparable and OEM pro from the end of support for Windows 7. OEM non-pro revenue grew 24% and OEM pro revenue declined 9%. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. In Surface revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Search revenue ex TAC increased 2% and 1% in constant currency benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier. And in Gaming revenue increased 51% And 50% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 86% driven by the new console launch as well as the benefit from lower price promotions on our prior generation consoles. Xbox content and services revenue grew 40% and 38% in constant currency the strong growth in third party transactions, Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 9% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to gaming. Operating expense decreased 10% and operating income grew 25% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $5.4 billion up 20% year-over-year to support growing global demand and customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion increased 17% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by payments related to a tax audit settlement. Free cash flow was $8.3 billion up 17%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 33% and 41% respectively. Other income and expense was $440 million higher than anticipated primarily driven by net gains on investments including mark to market gains on our equity portfolio as well as net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 16% in line with expectations. And finally we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; an increase of 18% year-over-year. Now let's move to our outlook. My commentary for both the next quarter and any remarks for the full year does not include any impact from the ZeniMax acquisition which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. In our commercial business, consistent execution, focus on customer success and a compelling solution portfolio in high growth markets should drive another strong quarter. In our consumer business we expect to see healthy demand for PCs and productivity tools continue. The growth rates will again be impacted by the end of support for Windows 7 last year. In Gaming, we expect continued strong engagement on the Xbox platform and significant demand for the Xbox series X and S that will still be constrained by supply and our search in LinkedIn businesses should benefit from the improving advertising market. In commercial bookings we have a growing Q3 expiry base and a low prior year comparable. So strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our cloud platform should drive healthy growth. As a reminder an increasing mix of large long-term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive quarterly volatility and the growth rates. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased by approximately 3.0 year-over-year again driven by the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin will be offset by revenue make shift to Azure and continued investments to support our customer success. We expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis to our capital expenditures as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates we expect FX to increase total company revenue COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points. Within the segments FX should increase productivity and business processes revenue growth by approximately 3 points and intelligent cloud and more personal computing revenue growth by approximately 2 points. Now to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes we expect revenue between $13.35 billion and $13.6 billion. In Office commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with continued upsell opportunity to E5. In our on-premise business though we anticipate continued improvement in transactional purchasing trends we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens range consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer on a strong prior year comparable revenue growth should be similar to last quarter with continued growth in Microsoft 365 subscription revenue. In LinkedIn we expect continued strong engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth in the low 20% range and in dynamics continued momentum will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $14.7 billion and $14.95 billion. In Azure revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business and in our per-user business we expect continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. In our on-premise server business we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings on a strong prior year comparable that included the benefit from the end of support for Windows server 2008. And Enterprise services revenue growth should be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion. In Windows overall OEM revenue growth should be in the low single digits on a strong comparable mentioned earlier. Windows commercial products and cloud services growth should be in the low to mid teens driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. And in Surface good demand against a low prior comparable should drive growth in the mid to high teens range. In Search ex TAC growth should be driven by improvements in the advertising market and in Gaming we expect revenue growth of approximately 40% driven by next generation console sales as well as Xbox content and services revenue in the mid 20% range. Now back to the company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion and operating expense of $11.9 billion to $12 billion. Another income and expense interest income and expense should offset each other. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be approximately 15% slightly lower than our full year rate of approximately 16%. And finally, for FY21 with our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our outlook for Q3 we expect to deliver another full year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth as well as healthy operating margin expansion even after excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and COVID related savings. In closing, we have executed well in the first half of our fiscal year in a challenging and changing environment. Investments made over quarters and often years coupled with focused execution by our teams are the drivers behind a compelling portfolio that is delivering value today for our customers and creating optimism in our roadmap for tomorrow. Satya discussed our unique, comprehensive and integrated set of products earlier on the call; products and services that span large growth markets and we will continue to invest broadly and boldly against the significant opportunities ahead of us. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. As respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, could you please repeat your instructions?\nMark Moerdler: Thank you for taking my questions, and Satya and Amy and the whole team congratulations on the great quarter. It seems like almost every part of the business beat, there did not seem to be any meaningful impact from COVID or tougher comps. Two parts to the question: one, should we feel that the COVID impact is basically behind you? And two, is the tougher comps are we now seeing the demand as such that allows you to build on those larger numbers? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Mark. Maybe I'll start and Amy you can add to it. I think one of the things that we're seeing is the COVID impact has put a lot of constraints on our all our customers. But the one structural change is the digital technology is becoming critical even for core resilience and business continuity and to deal with what is going to be a structurally changed customer behavior and expectations. So as a tech company with that comprehensive differentiated portfolio all the way from business applications, industry solutions to infrastructure, I think, we benefit from that and that's what you saw this quarter. But more importantly, for me, Mark, when I look at the next 10 years of what compute and digital technology will do across industries, that's the opportunity that we are obviously staying very, very focused on and investing in.\nAmy Hood: And, Mark, maybe to the second-half of your question on being past some tougher comparables, I don't think we are and it's why I mentioned a couple of them, most particularly, I think, the OEM number with the pro end of support in Q3 and we did have another strong end of support for the server on-prem number. And so those are the two for Q3 in particular that I would make sure to call out.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations again. Stay safe.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thank you. Azure putting up a great accelerating quarter. Could you just talk to what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and maybe the size of the transactions? And anything else that you think is important to highlight why you're seeing this reacceleration in the business? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Brent. Maybe again I'll start, Amy you can add. I would say again with Azure, some of the core differentiation we have whether it comes to our hybrid leadership, some of the new data products that are highly differentiated and competitive in the marketplace as well as the integration with every other layer of our stack whether it's the dev layer with Power Platform or Github or with Teams to Power Apps to Azure DB, the industry solutions we now have in healthcare and in retail are all leading to that time to value the price differentiation and cost advantage to customers and most importantly, agility -- their ability to build their own digital capability. So that's what you see in the acceleration around Azure. But when we think about Microsoft Cloud, we think about all the parts coming together to deliver value and differentiation to our customers.\nA \u2013 Amy Hood: And maybe just to add a couple of thoughts on the shape, Brent, and to make sure that we're clear on some of the important drivers there, really, the Azure consumption comments are not about size of transactions, right, being signed and you obviously saw we had a good quarter in bookings, which is far more reflective of future commitment. In quarter, what we saw is really fundamental consumption growth and some reacceleration of growth curves, particularly in maybe industries that had been more hard hit in Q4 and Q1. And so I would describe it a little bit that way and including frankly, even some mid-market and some segment-based recovery on that front. So as I look forward, obviously, it's about what Satya talked about, which is there is differentiation, there is usage, there is looking forward to making sure that we continue to have great bookings numbers. But in the quarter itself, it was usage growth not the contracting that made a difference.\nBrent Thill: Thank you. \nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Amy, I wanted to ask you about the PBP guide for your third quarter or the March quarter. It was comfortably above where everybody, I think, is modeling. And in particular, I wanted to ask you about Office 365. Of all the businesses, the larger ones in Microsoft, most saw upside in this recent quarter except perhaps for Office 365, where despite the migration to E5 and despite the free-to-paid seat conversion, we really didn't see an acceleration in Office 365. I'm wondering if you could perhaps unpack that and describe why? And part two to the question is your guide for that segment is so good in the March quarter that one would infer that the Office 365 growth is likely to accelerate in March. I'm wondering if you could confirm whether that's a reasonable assumption? Thanks so much.\nAmy Hood: There's a couple of things, Karl, in the PBP guide and let me break them down a little bit. As you heard, actually, almost all the components in Q3 have sort of consistent to slightly better execution, right?. So there is upside that we saw in LinkedIn. There is upside in Office Commercial. There is upside that's reflected in the stronger subscriptions number we saw in consumer and there is good execution and dynamics. So for me, it's a bit more and then we'll come back and talk about Microsoft 365 all up in a second. Each of those pieces, there is really consistent performance into Q3, which is good. And so when you think about Office 365, interestingly, what we're seeing is a lot of the things we had seen before. But remember, we had a pretty tough comp a year ago in Office Commercial. And so for me, I look and say, gosh, we did great execution. We saw some improving trends in seat growth in the frontline; improving trends in SMB that won't yet be reflected, of course, in revenue; seeing good trial conversion, which again speaks to forward revenue more than in-quarter revenue given that's all subscription. And we saw - so you see better seat growth, good conversion and good E5 selling. So I actually feel pretty good leaving Q2 and entering Q3 in terms of value that customers are getting out of the subscriptions that they've got and the conversions that we're seeing in market.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I mean just one quick thing I would add is, when you look at Microsoft 365, I think, one of the things that one of the best things I've seen recently is when a customer talked about all the things that they're using compared to even just last year to now, that is new value from Office 365 and the usage depth and increase. That's I think really the real power of that franchise going forward. And so I hope, as shareholders, look at what's the depth and breadth of the offering and the usage and the usage depth by account, which I think is what at least we are investing and tracking closely.\nKarl Keirstead: That's helpful. Thank you both and congrats on the numbers.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Karl. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question guys and very nice quarter. Satya I wanted to dig into one of the topics that you mentioned in your introduction and that's kind of Teams working as a framework across all of your solutions and sort of connecting more and more people into the Microsoft framework. I was doing some calls this quarter and asking about a competitor's acquisition of a Team's competitor and a lot of people in the channel talk to me about how Teams was pulling through dynamic CRM and they understood that acquisition as a defense against that and I was surprised to hear that that there would be a linkage between the two. Could you help us one kind of understand how Teams pulled in additional products behind it number one and number two the connection between kind of Teams and how they get a broader base of frontline workers into the story from Microsoft because I think most people think about Microsoft is like an information worker story for frontline workers is another huge kind of area for you guys to go after.\nSatya Nadella: No, thanks much Keith for the question. That is absolutely right and I think I commented on this earlier as well in our calls which is we built Teams as essentially this tool that brings together multiple capabilities. It brings together chat. It brings together meetings, collaboration that is office collaboration as well as business process workflow all into one scaffolding. That's the biggest breakthrough of Teams. In the past obviously we had suites of tools but this is the first product more so than Outlook was even in terms of being able to integrate communications, collaboration and business process and that's what you see when we talked about it. In my comments that's why one of the things I stressed was what was happening with just line of business applications before any SaaS application ours or others the reality is the most usage in any enterprise is line of business applications that were built custom by that enterprise and their IT organizations for all the departments whether it's HR or finance or operations. That is really one of the bigger drivers of Teams usage as a platform capability. So you can think you brought up first line. There is some shift scheduling application, some inventory counting application that the frontline person is using on a mobile phone with Teams but the inventory management app was just a Power app built using Power apps so that is what you're seeing and then of course the integrations into dynamics, integrations into all SaaS applications whether it's workday or whether it's SAP or whether it is ServiceNow and even Salesforce all of these applications are getting integrated into Teams very rapidly and so that's the power of Teams as a platform capability that we're seeing and you're absolutely right that this is no longer about just knowledge workers collaborating. In fact, if anything it's about knowledge workers collaborating and enabling frontline workers with more of these work to participate with digital tools in the workflow versus being disconnected. \nKeith Weiss: Thanks. That's a fascinating experience story. Thanks for digging in on it with us.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks Keith. Operator we will take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much and I'll add my congrats as well. Amy do you see a sustainably different post-COVID expense profile for Microsoft as it relates to real estate footprint and T&E levels and maybe Satya you could perhaps comment on this as well. Are you expecting a fuller return to the Office and fuller resumption of business travel over time such that expense profile wouldn't look very different?\nSatya Nadella: Maybe I'll just talk about broadly how I think both at Microsoft as well as what we are seeing as this return to work. I think the key thing Mark we just think about is there will be more flexibility in terms of time, where they work even, the site's people work because I think the expectations have changed. We obviously are not going to have the same constraints going forward. So I'm not at all assuming that we just remain as is all the way going forward. But at the same time there is no return to January of 2020. So therefore what I think is key for us is to really should maintain flexibility and that's why even going back to the conversation around Teams it's not like the work only happens in online meetings. Work happens before meetings, during meetings, after meetings and especially in hybrid work you need that sophisticated set of tools that really track workflow irrespective of who is where and so that's what we are focused on and in our own policies we have laid out of policies which give more flexibility and it'll be different by function, different by geography, different in time. So that's how we expect essentially work to evolve. I don't know Amy if you want to add a little more on the expense side.\nAmy Hood: Yes, I think what I would add is maybe to take a step back from the narrowness in some ways of the question Mark and expanded to say the overall expense logic that we have going forward and in many ways that's why I talked about, we've seen headcount growth of over 10% in the past year as we invest in the significant opportunities we see and having customers be successful and that's at a time when frankly we are coming up on the anniversary across many spots of the world of where we've been working remotely for close to a year. And so it's about continuing to invest in those places, looking and learning about the types of flexibility that we are able to provide our own employees, what travel patterns need to look like and of course will do what it takes to deliver success to customer which should be the driving force behind how we invest in that segment and finally as there is obviously lots of opportunity for us to continue to be flexible in how we work specifically which is where Satya talked about. But this is a pretty broad conversation and in many ways I think talks to a broader rethink of what productivity means across every industry and every role which I actually think is a very exciting time both for Microsoft 365 and lots of the tools we are developing.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks Mark. Operator we will take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. \nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thank you. Question for Satya and how you're thinking about the $200 billion enterprise applications market? Your market share on that areas is fairly low in aggregate. You've got Dynamics that's performing really well and sounds like is accelerating. Just wondering how you're looking at that market more broadly as an opportunity for the company?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. We are very-very focused on what we think is modern business process applications Walter. The way I look at it is there's a complete rethink on even if you take the previous conversation around what are the workflows that need to get integrated into a communications tools such that there is real continuity between frontlines to knowledge worker to business process. I think that opens up even a ton of opportunity. I mean take something like even digital twins and the level of automation that one can bring even into manufacturing. So the combination of an Azure pass service to SaaS capabilities in Dynamics 365 can be very transformative to digital manufacturing which is probably going to be one of the bigger trends going forward. Same thing in supply chain. So it's a pretty important area for us, business process and business applications participation if you will, will be both on the Azure side, on the data side, on the AI side and the biz apps side as well as Power apps. So it's not one narrow category because I think most people the way you measure business applications and the categories of business and applications is pretty narrow but business process is much broader than that and so that's I think at least what we are building towards.\nAmy Hood: And maybe just to add a bit to that Satya just I think for us one of the exciting parts about dynamics and for shareholders is the expansiveness of that redefinition by industry and even the terms and categorization today that define biz apps I think we'll see are quite large and will be addressed not just with our dynamics product portfolio but partially with our LinkedIn portfolio, with our Power platform portfolio, with Microsoft 365 as well as Azure and I think that and thinking about it holistically is why it's so important for us and why we keep coming back to the commercial cloud as our frame. It's how customers see the solution. It's how we sell. It's how solutions are actually implemented for business process change.\nMichael Spencer: Great. Thanks Walter. Operator we will take next question. Please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you and congrats from me as well. I wanted to talk a little bit about Gaming. Obviously you had a very strong quarter but we also saw a few months ago the launch of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate so all the Xbox as we knew it can you talk a little bit about some of the early experiences there and the importance that you see emerging for that? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Maybe I'll start Amy you can add to this. On Xcloud it's very early days but we are very excited about fundamentally the expansion opportunity it provides. So the service today really allows us to take our catalog and not be limited to any of the traditional endpoints in particular the console and the PC and expand beyond that and so as you can imagine that I think from a reach perspective is very exciting to us and the fact that we now have a technology solution to do so we are in the very early innings of it while at the same time ensuring that we are doing a fantastic job for all our console gamers and PC gamers is going to be how we'll approach the value of our subscriptions.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. \nMichael Spencer: Thanks Raimo. Operator we'll take the last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Amy, the cash flow in the quarter [ex] the audit settlement was far ahead of everyone's expectations and I know you talked about strong billings in the quarter but as we look forward are there any puts and takes that we should be aware of or should we just focus on cash flow growing pretty much in line with net income? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Yes, in general Brad it's a very good question because the things you tend to watch that can move it quarter to quarter or things like you've mentioned whether it's the settlement this quarter, whether it's for free cash flow, the timing of cash capital expenditures versus on an accrual basis but overall it really should move in line with operating income generally and really reflect the fundamentals of our business execution. It's been something we focused on and I do feel like strong sales improving margins especially in the cloud have all benefited us on those lines.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you very soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you all and stay safe.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2020-10-27 21:15:06", "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2021 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Mike. We\u2019re off to a strong start in fiscal 2021, driven by the continued strength of our commercial cloud, which surpassed $15 billion in revenue, up 31% year-over-year. The next decade of economic performance for every business will be defined by the speed of their digital transformation. We\u2019re innovating across the full modern tech stack to help customers in every industry improve time to value, increase agility, and reduce costs. Now, I\u2019ll highlight examples of our momentum and impact starting with Azure. We\u2019re building Azure as the world\u2019s computer with more data center regions than any other provider, now 66, including new regions in Austria, Brazil, Greece, and Taiwan. We\u2019re expanding our hybrid capabilities so that organizations can seamlessly build, manage, and deploy their applications anywhere. With Arc, customers can extend Azure management and deploy Azure data services on-premise, at the edge, or in multi-cloud environments. With Azure SQL Edge, we\u2019re bringing SQL data engine to IoT devices for the first time. And with Azure Space, we\u2019re partnering with SpaceX and SES to bring Azure compute to anywhere on the planet. Leading companies in every industry are taking advantage of this distributed computing fabric to address their biggest challenges. In energy, both BP and Shell rely on our cloud to meet sustainability goals. In consumer goods, PepsiCo will migrate its mission critical SAP workloads to Azure. And with Azure for Operators, we\u2019re expanding our partnership with companies like AT&T and Telstra, bringing the power of the cloud and the edge to their networks. Just last week, Verizon chose Azure to offer private 5G mobile edge computing to their business customers. When it comes to data, Azure brings together cloud native, limitless data and unmatched analytics. Nearly 1 million SQL databases are migrated to Azure to date, and we process more than 1.4 trillion customer queries each day. The number of petabyte scale workloads running on Azure has more than doubled year-over-year. Azure Synapse redefines cloud analytics by bringing together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. With Synapse Link, customers can run real-time analytics over their operational data. They can build advanced AI models using Azure Machine Learning to identify trends and predict outcomes. And with Power BI, anyone in an organization can access these insights and build custom dashboards. From Electrolux, GE Aviation, and Rockwell Automation in manufacturing to Marks and Spencers and Myntra in retail, businesses are choosing Synapse to accelerate time to insight across their organization. They\u2019re also leading in AI in its enterprise applications. Azure Cognitive Services make it easier for organizations from Airbus to Volkswagen to build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making. We\u2019re going further to meet some of our customers\u2019 biggest challenges today, introducing new capabilities to understand people\u2019s movements in physical space and detect anomalies and metrics, and our partnership with OpenAI brings leading edge large scale AI models such as GPT-3 to Azure. Now, to developers. As software developers become critical to value creation in every industry, their productivity is key to business performance. We have the most widely used and loved tool chain to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. With the most popular code editing tools, Visual Studio as well as VS Code, developers are more productive than ever. With GitHub, more than 70% of the Fortune 50 build software together. And with Azure, they have the best-in-class services to build the cloud native apps and modernize existing ones. New code scanning capabilities in GitHub help developers find security vulnerabilities before they reach production, and new integrations between GitHub and Power Apps enable professional developers and domain experts to collaborate. At the PaaS layer, we\u2019re innovating to help developers build modern applications. New Azure Communication Services enables any developer to integrate rich communication APIs into their application using the same infrastructure that powers Teams. With Azure Mixed Reality Services, the entire world is an application canvas. Lockheed Martin, for example, is using Azure Mixed Reality and HoloLens to speed up the development of the Orion spacecraft. Now to Power Platform. More than ever, companies need to empower domain experts to increase the rate of digitization across the enterprise. Power Platform is the only low-code/no code solution that enables anyone in an organization to rapidly create an application, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow, or analyze data. Power Platform now has more than 10 million monthly active users at more than 500,000 organizations, from IKEA to Toyota. PayPal, for example, is using Power BI within Teams to expand access to data insights. More than 1,900 organizations have signed up to use the Return to Workplace solution to help keep employees safe and healthy when they go back to the office. The Los Angeles Unified School District plans to use Power Platform to help keep 700,000 students and educators safe across more than 1,400 schools when they reopen. Now onto Dynamics 365. As organizations look to move from being reactive to proactive, they are choosing Dynamics 365. From AEP and Chipotle to Ingram Micro and Walgreens Boots Alliance, we are seeing strong adoption of our customer data platform, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. More companies are turning to our mixed reality solutions to keep employees connected with experts even when they are apart. Mercedes Benz is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to help technicians across its U.S. dealerships service increasingly complex cars faster, and BHP is using the solution to keep employees at mining sites in rural Australia safe. Just yesterday, we announced a partnership with C3.ai and Adobe to bring to market a new class of industry-specific CRM solutions powered by Dynamics 365. And our first industry-specific cloud, the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, will become generally available later this week. It brings together healthcare-specific capabilities from across Dynamics 365, as well as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and Azure, to help providers like Cleveland Clinic and St. Luke\u2019s Health Network improve patient outcomes.  Now to LinkedIn. Amid a rapidly changing work environment, LinkedIn is where more than 722 million professionals go to connect with their communities, learn new skills and find new opportunities. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter. We launched our most significant redesign with a streamlined search and messaging experience as well as new ways of connecting and sharing with Stories. More professionals are turning to LinkedIn Learning to increase their knowledge capital watching more than 1 million hours of content each week more than double the amount a year ago. Three people are hired every minute on LinkedIn, and new features make it easier for nearly 40 million job seekers to indicate they\u2019re looking for their next opportunity. In marketing solutions, advertiser demand on LinkedIn returned to near pre-COVID levels, up 40% year-over-year, as marketers use our tools to connect with professionals ready to do business. And organizations continue to tap into the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 to ensure salespeople have the context they need to sell remotely. Now to Microsoft 365. PCs have become mission critical to sustain work, learning, and life at home and maintain business continuity in the enterprise in a remote everything world. Windows 10 monthly active devices are up double digits year-over-year, across commercial, consumer, and education. And, we will have the largest lineup of Surface and OEM devices ever this holiday season to support every person and work style. Microsoft 365 is the comprehensive suite of productivity apps and experiences people use and rely on every day. Teams now has more than 115 million daily active users. We are seeing increased usage intensity as people communicate, collaborate and co-author contents across work, life, and learning. All up, Microsoft 365 users generated more than 30 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter. Teams is the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration, as well as business process workflows in a secure, integrated user experience. And, as companies move online, they also want one unified platform from meetings to phone systems, which Teams delivers. The key to productivity is to move beyond transactional meetings and stay in the flow of work and maintain business process context. That\u2019s where Microsoft 365 and Teams stand out. You collaborate on a PowerPoint presentation before a meeting and share it with participants in SharePoint. If you miss a meeting, you can access a recording via Stream and catch up via persistent chat. Action items can automatically be assigned in Lists. With Power Platform in Teams, you can build custom productivity apps using lists as the data source. And you can even connect Dynamics 365 to Teams so you can see customer information and take action. It\u2019s clear that people will need more flexibility in when, where, and how they work. We are adding reimagined workspaces in Teams for every collaborator, remote, in-person, or on the go, and we\u2019re accelerating our innovation for both first-line and knowledge workers, with over one hundred new capabilities in the last six months, including breakout rooms, meeting recaps, shift scheduling, and large scale digital events up to 20,000 participants, to help people transcend both time and distance. Employee health and wellbeing is a top concern for every CEO. We are innovating with new experiences to help people prioritize wellbeing in the flow of work. New insights in Teams provide personalized recommended actions, making it easier for employees to create healthy work habits and for leaders to build high-performing teams. New virtual commute gives structure to the remote workday with scheduled cognitive breathers. And, Together Mode is helping employees at companies like Office Depot reduce video fatigue. More broadly, we are accelerating our innovation across Microsoft 365. New Microsoft Stream is the video platform for the enterprise, making it easy to create, share, and discover videos at work. Transcription and voice commands in Word help people save time. And SharePoint Syntex makes it easier to find and work with content across the enterprise. We are seeing Microsoft 365 momentum in every industry. In education, nearly 270,000 institutions are using Teams to power remote learning and improve learning outcomes, including the University of Nottingham in the UK, Morehouse College, the University of South Florida, and some of the largest school districts in the United States, like Miami Dade County Public Schools. In sports, the NBA and NFL are reimagining the gameday experience for fans. PepsiCo will deploy Microsoft 365 and Teams to its 270,000 employees worldwide. And, Morgan Stanley, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Prudential Financials all chose Microsoft 365 E5 this quarter for differentiated security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now to security. We are the only company that offers end-to-end capabilities to protect and manage data, devices, identities, and infrastructure holistically, enabling a cross-platform and multi-cloud Zero Trust architecture. H&R Block, for example, used our tools to implement Zero Trust principles in just two weeks, enabling thousands of tax professionals to securely work from home. In identity, Azure AD has nearly 400 million monthly active users, and we\u2019ve seen usage of third party apps increase 2X since last year. In security, new Microsoft Defender simplifies threat detection and response, and now includes coverage for Android and iOS, as well as multi-cloud and on-premise protection for SQL workloads. In device and data management, Microsoft Endpoint Manager monitors an organization\u2019s devices in a unified platform, and new tools offer proactive remediation of issues before they disrupt end users. And, in compliance, our new Compliance Manager offers more than 150 out of the box assessments for regulations such as GDPR. Now to gaming. Gaming is the most expansive category in entertainment industry. 3 billion consumers look to gaming for entertainment, community, and achievement, and our ambition is to empower each of them, wherever they play. Our Xbox Game Pass service has more than 15 million subscribers. Quality differentiated content is the flywheel behind the service\u2019s growth, and the addition of EA Play next month, along with our pending acquisition of ZeniMax Media, will add more of the world\u2019s most iconic franchises to the more than 100 high-quality games already available and materially increases our ability to increase content. We\u2019re also transforming how games are distributed and played, and reaching new players on mobile and tablet, by bringing cloud gaming to Game Pass. Finally, we\u2019re delighted by early reviews and excitement in the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, which will be the most affordable and the most powerful consoles available. In closing, in a world of uncertainty and constraints, every person and every organization needs more digital technology to recover and reimagine what comes next. This represents an unprecedented expansion of our addressable market in every layer of the tech stack. We are focused on innovating and differentiating to meet these needs and growing opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And, I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $37.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Gross margin dollars increased 15%. Operating income increased 25%. And earnings per share was $1.82, increasing 32% and 30% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. In our commercial business, customers accelerated their digital transformation priorities. And we again saw strong demand for our differentiated, high-value hybrid and cloud offerings, resulting in increased commitment to our platform and higher usage. Overall, our transactional licensing business remained a headwind, although the small and medium business customer segment improved slightly through the quarter. In our consumer business, continued demand for PCs and productivity tools benefited Windows OEM non-Pro, Office Consumer, and Surface. An improved advertising market benefited search and LinkedIn. And we saw continued strong engagement across our Gaming platform. Moving to our overall results. On a strong prior year comparable and relatively small expiration base, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 23% and 18% in constant currency, driven by our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of large, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24% and 23% in constant currency to $107 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within the next 12 months and beyond the next 12 months. Commercial cloud revenue grew 31% to $15.2 billion. And commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 5 points year-over-year to 71%, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets discussed in our July earnings call. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly, despite revenue mix shift to Azure and increased usage to support our customers\u2019 remote work scenarios. This quarter, FX had no impact on revenue growth, more favorable than anticipated, due to the weaker U.S. dollar. And in line with expectations, FX had no impacts on COGS or operating expense growth. Company gross margin percentage was up 2 points year-over-year to 70%, driven by the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down slightly, with increasing cloud revenue mix and continued investments, such as trial offers and flexible financing options, that delivered greater customer value in this challenging environment. Operating expense increased 3%, lower than anticipated, driven by greater than expected COVID-related savings and investments that shifted to future quarters. And operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 43%, including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $12.3 billion, increasing 11%, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by LinkedIn and Office Consumer. On a strong prior year comparable, Office Commercial revenue grew 9% with continued impact from the transactional weakness noted earlier. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 21% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. E5 revenue growth accelerated with strong value in our advanced security, compliance, and voice components. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15% year-over-year, with early momentum in free trial conversions. And we saw continued seat growth in small and medium business and first-line worker offerings, with improvement through the quarter, though again at more moderated levels. Office 365 commercial now accounts for over 70% of our existing Office Commercial paid installed base. Office Consumer revenue grew 13%, with better than expected sales of Office 2019 and accelerating growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, up 27% year-over-year to 45.3 million. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 18% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% and 37% in constant currency. Growth in the number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads accelerated, reflecting the value of our modern solutions with compelling time to value. LinkedIn revenue increased 16%, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily driven by a stronger advertising market that benefited our marketing solutions business. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year, including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, partially offset by sales mix to cloud. Operating expense increased 4%, and operating income increased 19% year-over-year, including 6 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 21% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 48% and 47% in constant currency, driven by consistent, strong growth in our consumption-based business. This quarter, we saw better than expected growth in our per-user enterprise mobility business as the installed base increased 27% to 152 million seats. And our on-premises server business decreased 1%, with impact from continued transactional weakness and a strong prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows Server and SQL server 2008. Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 5% in constant currency, again driven by Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year, with nearly 4 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 10%, and operating income increased 39% and 38% in constant currency, with roughly 13 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11.8 billion, increasing 6%, with better than expected performance in Windows OEM non-Pro, Surface, and Search. In Windows, overall OEM revenue declined 5%, better than expected. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 31%, benefiting from demand for larger screens for productivity. And OEM Pro revenue declined 22%, impacted by lower commercial demand across all customer segments and a prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows 7. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, as continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions was partially offset by a lower mix of multiyear agreements that carry higher in-quarter revenue recognition, as well as continued transactional weakness. In Surface, revenue grew 37% and 36% in constant currency, driven by year-over-year differences in product launch timing and channel purchasing as well as overall PC market demand. Search revenue ex TAC declined 10% and 11% in constant currency. And in Gaming, revenue increased 22% and 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong engagement and monetization across the platform, though at a slightly lower rate than last quarter. Xbox content and services revenue increased 30%, with strong growth in third party transactions, GamePass subscribers, and first-party titles. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8%, and gross margin increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements primarily within Gaming and Surface were mostly offset by a lower mix of Windows revenue. Operating expense decreased 8%, and operating income grew 18% year-over-year. Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $5.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year to support growing customer usage and demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.9 billion. On a low prior year comparable that included tax payments related to the transfer of intangible property, cash flow from operations was $19.3 billion, up 40% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $14.4 billion, up 38%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations grew 12% as healthy cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to the Xbox hardware inventory build. And free cash flow grew 3%, reflecting a significant increase in cash payments for PP&E. Other income and expense was $248 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement and investments, including mark-to-market gains on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was 14%, with a greater than expected impact from equity vests in the quarter. And finally, we returned $9.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Now let\u2019s move to our outlook. In our commercial business, expanding addressable markets, differentiated value, and consistent execution should drive another quarter of increased usage and growing commitment to our platform that drive commercial bookings. However, a declining expiry base will impact growth. As always, large, long-term Azure contracts are more unpredictable in their timing and an increasing mix of these long-term agreements drives more quarterly volatility in bookings. And though trends have improved a bit, growth will continue to be impacted by transactional weakness. A strong prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, as well as transactional strength in Japan across our Office businesses, will also impact growth rates. In our consumer business, we expect some benefit from continued consumer PC market growth, though at a more moderated growth rate than last quarter, given the traditionally high volume of PCs sold every Q2. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will increase approximately 3 points year-over-year, again driven by the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin will be offset by mix shift to Azure. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter to support growing usage and demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total Company revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on COGS growth. Within the segments, FX should increase Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on More Personal Computing revenue growth. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $12.75 billion and $13 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with continued upsell opportunity to E5. However, growth will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable noted earlier, as well as a decline of approximately 30% in our on-premises business, driven by continued transactional weakness and the ongoing customer shift to Office 365. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-single-digits, down sequentially, as continued growth in Microsoft 365 subscription revenue will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable and the seasonality of the PC market noted earlier. In LinkedIn, we expect the improved advertising market and continued strong engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. And in Dynamics, continued Dynamics 365 momentum will drive revenue growth, though at a slightly lower rate than last quarter, in line with historical seasonality in that business. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $13.55 billion and $13.8 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will be driven by our consumption-based business, with continued strong growth on a significant base. And in our per-user business, we expect growth rates to moderate further, given the size of the enterprise mobility installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single-digits as demand for our hybrid and premium offerings will be offset by continued transactional weakness and the impact from the prior year comparable noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be up low-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.2 billion and $13.6 billion. In Windows, on the strong prior year comparable, overall revenue should decline in the high single digit range. In our OEM business, we expect another strong quarter in OEM non-Pro, but OEM Pro will again be impacted by the lower commercial demand. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by the continued demand for our advanced security solutions. However, growth will be materially impacted by a lower mix of multiyear agreements that carry higher in-quarter revenue recognition primarily due to the declining expiry base and a large deal in the prior year. In Surface, revenue will be relatively unchanged, impacted by the year-over-year timing differences of product lifecycle transitions noted earlier. In Search ex-TAC, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high-single-digit range. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the high 20% range. We expect very strong demand following the launch of our next generation Xbox Series X and S consoles, driving supply-constrained hardware revenue growth of approximately 40%. We also expect negative gross margin impact from console sales this quarter, as we invest against the growing life-time value of the platform. Xbox content and services revenue should grow in the low 20% range, with strong engagement and continued momentum in GamePass subscribers. As a reminder, our outlook does not include ZeniMax, which we still expect to close in the second half of the fiscal year. Now, back to Company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.75 billion to $13.95 billion and operating expense of $11.4 billion to $11.5 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 tax rate to be approximately 16%. In closing, I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts as we look beyond the next quarter. As digital transformation accelerates and our sales teams and partners continue to execute well in serving customers, our high value solutions should drive full-year double-digit revenue growth in our commercial segments even in a challenging and competitive environment. Given our significant ambition, desire to enable our customer\u2019s visions for their future, and the opportunity that creates, we will continue to invest in high-growth markets and strategic areas that will further enhance our position. With that, Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect to other on the call, we request the participants to please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question. And very nice quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about Intelligent Cloud and the trends that you\u2019re seeing there. We\u2019re picking up in stuff, like our CIO surveys, a really strong indication from CIOs that they want to move more aggressively to the public cloud. We\u2019re seeing that in good results from Azure. How should we think about the on-premise server and tools business on a going-forward basis? Is this increased preference for public cloud going to more permanently in payer, server and cloud -- I\u2019m sorry, server and tools growth in the on-premise environment, or is there a potential for this to be coming back to the low-to-mid single-digit growth that we\u2019ve seen historically once we pass these tough comps?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, and Keith, thanks for the question. And Amy, you can add to it. A couple of things, Keith. One is, the approach we have always taken is that distributed computing will remain distributed. So, the cloud and the edge is what will be the distributed fabric for applications. So, if you look at where our growth is coming from for the all-up number Intelligent Cloud, it\u2019s coming from the infrastructure layer, the flexibility that we have around hybrid deployment, things like Azure Arc are very differentiated. Same thing with data, that\u2019s one of the big future innovations even in the last quarter was the ability to deploy, for example, Azure data in any cloud, including the edge, so that deployment drives application preference for our infrastructure. The two other things that are happening is developers, whether it\u2019s lift shift, modernized motion or just new applications because of what they\u2019re doing on GitHub or Azure DevOps or VS Code, choosing Azure services and with Power Platform, Dynamics or M 365 because a lot of these logic apps that people build are about stitching together extensions of workflows of multiple SaaS apps. So, we have all three of these trends leading to more intense usage of infrastructure data and the application PaaS services. And so, that\u2019s how we view it. I don\u2019t sort of look at each quarter what\u2019s happening on server plus cloud. I look at the holistic deployment options that our customers need for their increasingly distributed applications. And so, that\u2019s sort of what I see. And Amy, if you want to add to it, please go ahead.\nAmy Hood: Sure. And Keith, maybe I can help a little bit. In general, I think, it\u2019s easier if you think about Azure plus the annuity business as being this durable hybrid edge cloud value that Satya is talking about, and we continue to see very strong and consistent performance across those things in terms of renewal rates, the strength of premium, the strength of hybrid value props. And so, that aspect, Keith, because of the reasons Satya mentioned, we don\u2019t see nearly as much change in that. It\u2019s frankly, why you see bookings numbers that are very good. It\u2019s why we see RPO both less than 12 months. Think about that as our core annuity motion versus longer than 12 months, which are these Azure longer contracts, all having very healthy growth. So, then, what you\u2019re left with is a small component of the business, which is that non-annuity/what we call transactional business, which is one-time purchases, all recognized in-quarter. And because of that, it does move around a lot more, and it helped obviously when we had end of support, we were transparent about that. And then, it hurts more both in this macro environment but more so just because of some tough comparables. And so, while we will continue to have that through a few quarters and we\u2019ll expect it to bounce around a bit because of the nature of 100% in-quarter recognition, the fundamentals of bookings, renewals, premium, and hybrid value as well as Azure consumption feel far more consistent than not is how I would answer that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Amy, I had a question. You just made some really strong robust growth comments on the top line as you look out into the future, but you\u2019ve also invested, rightly so, your desire to invest for your customers in key growth areas. I think, one of the questions people might be wondering is, how do we think about how that might impact operating margin trajectory? And should we interpret your comments that obviously growth remains really strong and we\u2019re investing for growth but there\u2019s an eye on profitability as well? Like how would you like those comments interpreted a little bit more deeply? Thank you so much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Heather. If you take a step back, the comments are really about the consistency and the opportunity in front of us. And so, in our commercial segments, where we\u2019re seeing consistent annuity execution, we\u2019re seeing increasing usage, we\u2019re seeing good deployment. And frankly, the portfolio that Satya went through in his comments, if you go section by section, it\u2019s talking about amazing like TCO advantages that the portfolio offers even for our commercial customers who are looking for ways to accelerate but control costs. And so for us, when you see operating environments like that where you see the opportunity, you feel good about your portfolio, you can feel -- and we basically feel good about our complete stack but at a high value. What we want to make sure we do, and my comments were around those, are really about making it clear that we intend to continue to go after the opportunity we see. And so, of course, we\u2019re always thoughtful about how we invest. But, in these areas where we see such strong signal, I do expect us to continue to focus. And at the operating margins, a real focus will also just be -- as we enter the second half of the year, it\u2019s obviously impacted by some of the hardware investments that we\u2019re making as well as the overall Windows numbers. So, that\u2019s probably the best way to think about it, I suppose.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you so much.\nAmy Hood: And Heather, congratulations. We\u2019ll miss having you on the call after seven years.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you so much. Bye.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking the question. And congratulations on a really nice clean quarter. Given the flare-ups in COVID in certain geographies and continuing lockdowns, do you think there is increasing pressure on overall spending? Does it impact SaaS adoption going forward? And adding to that, how do you see your supply chain for the cloud components? Are you going to be able to meet all the demands? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: So, maybe I\u2019ll start, and Amy, you can add to it. I mean, overall, what we have learned over whatever, the last nine months or so is the best way for any business to ensure both, resilience as well as pivot and transform and reimagine how to work with some of the constraints is digital tech. So, whether it\u2019s infrastructure, whether it\u2019s data or on SaaS, it\u2019s, in fact, increased adoption rate. And that\u2019s what you see, like where you see it in Power Apps, for example, in many cases, even the smallest of businesses need to be able to deploy a solution quickly for some workflow that allows them, say, for example, to do curbside pickup if you\u2019re a retailer and a small business. But they were able to build that easily and deploy it. So, that\u2019s what we are seeing, which is increasing adoption and use. And on the supply chain side, we have worked through. We did get -- and we had the initial rush, we did have demand surges that needed us to sort of work through on our supply chain. We feel very good right now on how the supply is working to support the demand. Amy?\nAmy Hood: Nothing to add, Satya.\nOperator: Next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on the Office 365 commercial. And Amy, thank you for that update that you are now 70% penetrated. And if I go back to the financial analyst briefing back in 2017, that was 50%. So, I guess, two questions. One is that, could you help us sort of unpack just the installed base growth? Obviously, with those 2 percentages, the numbers you gave, that\u2019s pretty healthy installed base growth. And then, as a follow-up to that, one of the things you mentioned too is obviously the continued migration to E5. Sort of what inning are we in for sort of the E3 to E5 motion? And how important is voice, which is one of the things you mentioned on E5 just to Office 365 going forward?\nSatya Nadella: Amy, go ahead.\nAmy Hood: Let me break down your question, Phil, because I want to make sure that the comment on 70% is really thought about in the right way. It\u2019s 70% of the current installed base. And so, one of the key components of that is we have, as you said, continued to see installed base growth. And whether that\u2019s adding first-line worker scenarios, whether it\u2019s increasing in small business, there\u2019s so many ways for us to continue to add tremendous value, continue to grow the installed base. But, we are pleased that we have 70% on more modern experiences obviously of Office 365 in terms of adding to productivity and being able to continue to offer, to your point, some of this motion on E3 and E5. To that question, there\u2019s actually room, Phil, on both of those motions. We\u2019ve got room to continue, to have people move to E3. We\u2019ve got room to continue, obviously. And it\u2019s not just voice, although that is an important component. The really exciting value in E5 is that it offers security value, it offers compliance value, it offers voice, there\u2019s analytics value. And so, the reality is all of them are becoming more meaningful, especially in time to value and TCO. The one thing also that I sometimes think gets missed when we talk about Office 365 is one of the other key motions that\u2019s important around this group and business is the ability for us to continue to add the Microsoft 365 components, whether that\u2019s EMS or Windows security value. And so, while we\u2019re excited about the installed base and the progress, it also creates a good opportunity for us to continue to move people to the Microsoft 365 SKU and not just through the SKUs of Office.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Amy, I wanted to ask you a question. Given the comment you made about bookings volatility, I wanted to ask about some of the Azure trends, in particular that we can\u2019t see such as the level of Azure migration activity that might still be in the planning phase, or if deals have been signed, how you feel about the Azure backlog that will convert to revenues over the next year or so? And, whether some of the Azure go-lives have been pushed by a quarter or two, given the uncertain environment? That kind of color might serve as a nice complement to the solid 47% reported Azure number you gave. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Go ahead, Amy.\nAmy Hood: Karl, it\u2019s a good question. Maybe let me break down some of the components. When you think about Azure and some of these longer term sort of deals I was discussing, the longer term bigger deals, when I talk about them being more volatile, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s more that we don\u2019t really focus on the exact moment in time that they get done. They tend to be partnerships that we\u2019re really working through. They take longer for planning. And so, these types of partnerships, it\u2019s really about making sure we make them successful far more than which quarter that they arrive in. And so, that does just result in a little bit more volatility in that bookings number. Now, in -- so I would separate that from the question you\u2019re asking, which I think is [Technical Difficulty] around how much of that creates [Technical Difficulty] exist today in our good annuity performance on-prem. So, for us, that is about investing in customer success. And so for us, that\u2019s been one of the important investments we\u2019ve made over the past couple of years and why we continue to invest in everything from skilling at our customers, up through training, up through deployment and really make sure that each project is successful and has good value. And so, when you think about that, think about the annuity on-prem business as well as these longer-term Azure contracts as being effectively a book of business to continue to work and convert into, as you\u2019re talking about this consumption. Now within a quarter, the consumption obviously has other impacts. Most of it, obviously, is -- it\u2019s used and it\u2019s recognized in quarter. You\u2019ll see that number, as you know, jump around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. Some of that is the per user that we\u2019ve talked about. Things like EMS can have a little bit more in-quarter recognition. They can be impacted by an expiry base. And so, you\u2019ll see that number -- the Azure KPI jump around a little bit more than just from consumption. And you can have things like overages land on an annual basis as opposed to maybe a monthly basis, and that can also make the number jump arounda little bit. So, while the funnel and the conversion absolutely how we think about seeing strong bookings and a strong, especially longer than 12-month RPO balance, we certainly also sort of work that meticulously at the customer level to get projects to success.\nSatya Nadella: Just one thing I\u2019d add is, to Amy\u2019s earlier comment about our customer success motion, when we look at the app portfolio for any customer, we look to see, first of all, which apps do they want to just retire, which apps do they want to modernize and move to the cloud or new cloud starts. And then, we use all of what is there on our stack to help them, right? So, it could be a Power App that gets built, which is more part of Office 365 or Microsoft 365. It could be a SaaS application that is in dynamics module that\u2019s better for them because that\u2019s a faster time to value. And then -- and sometimes you build in Azure. So, we look at it holistically across all of the tech stack versus any one thing because that\u2019s what we think what differentiates Microsoft and creates preference for Microsoft long term. So, that\u2019s how we approach it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Satya, good to see the Teams number double and the MAUs in a pretty short duration. Maybe if you can just walk us through your next chapter of the Teams story and where you see the biggest opportunity, and what other components you are seeing attached to the Teams rollout? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Thank you so much for the question. Yes. Teams is very exciting to us because unlike anything else that we have done at the application layer, it\u2019s literally like a shell and has a platform effect because it is meetings, it\u2019s chat, it\u2019s collaboration as well as business process applications integrate into Teams. So, that scaffolding richness literally makes it a very robust platform. And so, we are seeing significant growth. You saw -- so, we talked about the usage growth, but we\u2019re also seeing significant growth of usage across all these modalities inside of Teams. But, the other aspect which I referenced in my remarks is, when you look at Microsoft 365 all-up, Teams is bolstering all-up growth, right, because meetings are important but they\u2019re transactional. Work happens before meetings, during meetings and after meetings. So, that ability to have the workflow completely stitched together is where Microsoft 365 really stands out. So, that reinforcing effect of Teams by itself and then Microsoft 365 in conjunction with Teams is where you\u2019ll see a significant amount of usage growth, more so than individual tools of the past even.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. Satya and Amy, I wondered if you could speak to the growth of Windows within MPC. In particular, as we move past the tough compares, how would you characterize the growth potential of Windows? And what would you envision are the key drivers, and perhaps even the key risks associated with that, with those comments on what you envision the durable growth is on Windows? Thank you very much.\nSatya Nadella: So, maybe I can start, Amy, and then you can add to it. If anything, again, the last nine months or so have proven that when it comes to Windows and PCs, they become mission-critical because when it comes to remote learning, remote work and any type of activity and productivity, in particular, depends on having PCs and applications on PCs. So, we are doubling down on it. That means, the innovation in Windows, and Microsoft 365 is the best way to conceptualize how we even think about Windows because it\u2019s one surface area where we want to deliver our best payloads for productivity, communications, collaboration, business process. And we\u2019ll keep working even on the form function innovation as well. So, even if you look at the holiday lineup of devices, it\u2019s great to see that, large screens, small screens, mobile, different chip architectures that make it pretty attractive to have a Windows device with you always. So, that\u2019s how we look at it. It\u2019s very important. I think, if anything, even mobile-only countries and mobile-only scenarios are recognizing that they also can do with some help with additional screens. And so, that\u2019s something that we look forward to.\nAmy Hood: And, I do think one of the ways to think, in particular, about commercial demand for Windows, to Satya\u2019s point, is it -- while it can have and tends to have, around end of support, some raised demand on the front, then you have a year of tough comparables, as we say, then it tends to generally stabilize and be quite consistent. And I think, as we\u2019ve seen in the past nine months, I think, the high and mission-critical value of a PC in the commercial environment, whether you\u2019re doing that from a remote situation or inside the walls of an office, I think, we feel very good about the value that we\u2019re offering.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: I\u2019ll squeeze in two, if I could. I wanted to follow up on Azure. This is a segment that\u2019s grown now to 17% of revenue. I think, that\u2019s up from 4% just three years ago. You talked about the number of petabyte-scale applications doubling. And from a size standpoint, it looks like in my model, Azure is bigger than the Windows business for the first time ever. My question really is around where are we at in the journey around Azure? How important is this to the Microsoft model? And ultimately, how big could it be looking out over the next three to five years?\nSatya Nadella: Let me start, and Amy, you can add to it. The way I think about the computing landscape going forward is if you sort of said at the highest of levels today as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is 5%. We think it will double in the next 10 years. And if anything, this pandemic perhaps has accelerated that doubling. And in that context, what\u2019s the large -- the most secular need, it\u2019s the need for distributed cloud infrastructure. It\u2019s both needed for modernizing existing applications you have, and so that\u2019s why -- by the way, 20% penetrated, so there\u2019s more 80% that needs to move. But more importantly, there\u2019s going to be new application starts which need infrastructure. And so, if you sort of add those up, I think that we\u2019re still in early innings. There will be between quarters, volatility, all of the points that Amy made even earlier. But, we think distributed cloud infrastructure is the most important layer. But, the way we\u2019ve approached it is not to just think of that layer in isolation but the data layer work we do composes, the AI layer composes and more importantly, our SaaS applications, whether business applications, Power Platform, Microsoft 365, all reinforce that same modern tech stack. So, I would still say that digitization in its -- this new tech stack is in its very infancy.\nAmy Hood: And Brent, I think the last point Satya made is maybe the most important is that when we think about and talk about expanding addressable markets or seeing more opportunity than we maybe even saw just a few quarters ago, it\u2019s at every layer. When people say that they have constraints, when you need a better time to value, when you need to reinvent each and almost every business process in a fast and effective manner, having every layer of the stack enabled by the infra layer, the data layer and the AI layer, I do think it\u2019s frankly early innings even in places where people think it seems to be nearer the end. And so, I think we feel a lot of optimism in that respect.\nBrent Bracelin: Certainly feels like an important milestone with Azure being larger than Windows for the first time. I guess, the last question for me is really on AI. And I know everyone\u2019s talked about this acceleration in digital adoption about across consumer and enterprise. But, it almost feels like the acceleration in AI is actually happening faster. I\u2019d be curious to hear kind of the plans for GPT-3 license and how you plan to democratize that across the platform. Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. It\u2019s a great observation because there are two sort of things that we are seeing is AI is actually being used by both professional developers, people who want these large-scale transformer models or to even do zero-shot learning, so we are seeing significant increases in card services usage across the board, which by the way, comes with the use of other compute services and data services in Azure. But, the other interesting thing is what I would call the domain experts who are using Power Apps, being able to tap into AI -- these card services to build these workflow assisted with AI. And that\u2019s where a lot of productivity gains for a lot of businesses and business process workflows is happening. So, it\u2019s exciting to see that as well as AI that\u2019s incorporated. I mean, every Teams session is full of AI because of the transcription services, the speech recognition services and so on that it incorporates and same thing with Dynamics as well.\nMichael Spencer: Thanks, Brent. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. Amid this macroeconomic environment, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $25 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 28% and 33% in constant currency. When I talk with customers, it's clear there is a real opportunity to help organizations in every industry use digital technology to overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger. In this environment, we are focused on 3 things: first, no company is better positioned than Microsoft to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative so that they can do more with less. From infrastructure and data to business applications and hybrid work, we provide unique differentiated value to our customers. Second, we will invest to take share and build new businesses in categories where we have long-term structural advantage. Lastly, we will manage through this period with an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence in our own operations to drive operational leverage. With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure. Organizations in every industry continue to choose our cloud to align their IT investments with demand. We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of $100 million-plus and $1 billion-plus deals this quarter. We have more data center regions than any other provider, and we will launch 10 regions over the next year. Our new Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps public sector customers meet urgent compliance, security and privacy requirements. With Azure Arc, we are meeting customers where they are enabling companies like GM, Greggs, UBS and Uniper to run applications across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We are seeing more customers move their mission-critical workloads to Azure. American Airlines, for example, chose our cloud to run its key operational workloads, including its data warehouse. And Telstra will move its internal IT workloads to Azure. And we are the platform of choice for SAP apps on the cloud. Leaders in every industry, including Kraft Heinz, Fujitsu and Unilever have migrated ERP workloads to Azure. Just last week, we announced a new service to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure. We are the only public cloud with simplified direct access to Oracle databases running in the Oracle Cloud. Now on to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric spanning operational databases, analytics and governance, helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating fragmented data estate. More than 65% of the Fortune 1000 use 3 or more of our data solutions, and we are growing faster than the market. We are seeing leaders in every industry from La Liga and Lenovo to Swiss Re and Walgreens unify their data using our tools. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding mission-critical workloads at any scale. Transactions in data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the fourth quarter in a row. When it comes to AI, we are seeing a paradigm shift as the world's large AI models become powerful platforms themselves. With our Azure OpenAI service, a diverse set of customers from HSBC, PwC and RTL Group to Shell and Wipro are applying language models to advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Now on to developer tools. We have the most popular developer tools across any cloud and any platform. Leaders in every industry from Ahold Delhaize to KPMG to Philips are all choosing GitHub to build software. GitHub Copilot is the first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, which helps developers write better code faster. More than 400,000 people have subscribed since we made it generally available a month ago. And with our expanding portfolio of container services, organizations like H&M can build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. All up, revenue from Azure container services increased by triple digits. Now on to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains at a time when it's never been more important. We now have nearly 25 million monthly active users, and we are innovating to make it even easier for teams of pro and citizen developers to build end-to-end business solutions together. AB InBev, ARM, Equinor, Toyota, Vodafone and Zurich Insurance have all built centers of excellence to train employees at scale on how to use Power Platform. PG&E, for example, expects to save at least 720,000 hours by eliminating redundant and manual processes across employee workflows. Now on to Dynamics 365. We are helping organizations digitize their customer experience, service, finance and supply chain functions as we continue to outgrow the market in every category. Our new Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform brings together Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams as well as enterprise AI capabilities from Nuance to help customers like HP deliver omnichannel customer engagement. And new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Intelligent Order Management and Teams help people collaborate in the flow of work to overcome supply chain disruptions. We are winning customers as we help organizations address their most pressing challenges. Pete's Coffee is modernizing its supply chain with our business applications. Carlsberg is standardizing its field service and customer service operations. And Visa switched to Dynamics 365 for both its sales and call center organizations. When it comes to our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are seeing strong adoption as we take a platform-driven approach to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative. For example, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, inclusive of Nuance, is becoming the platform of choice for companies across the health care value chain, looking to drive meaningful clinical and financial outcomes. Whether it's a provider modernizing care delivery, a health plan transforming the member experience or a retailer expanding into health services, having a technology partner that is truly dedicated to empowering their success is a significant differentiator for us. Intermountain Healthcare, for example, chose the Cloud for Healthcare as well as Nuance's DAX Ambient Intelligence solution as the pillar of its new digital strategy. Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. In this economic environment, every organization is looking to support employee flexibility and improve productivity. Hybrid work is now just work, and it's imperative that organizations reconnect and re-engage the work force at home and office and everywhere in between. To do this companies need a digital fabric that connects employees as well as customers and partners wherever and whenever they work while reducing cost and complexity. We\u2019re all in on Teams. Over the past year we\u2019ve introduced more than 450 capabilities to empower frontline and knowledge workers to collaborate synchronously and asynchronously as well as remote and in-person. Teams is taking share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling and seeing higher usage intensity as companies turn to the platform to accelerate their digital transformation and orchestrate all their business process in the flow of work. ISVs from Adobe to Workday have built deep integrations with Teams. And more than 100,000 companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Lumen Technologies and Progressive Insurance have deployed custom line of business applications in Teams. All up, the number of third-party and LOB apps with active usage increased by 40% year-over-year. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling across VoIP and PSTN. We now have over 12 million PSTN users, nearly double the number a year ago. And Teams Rooms bridges the gap between people working remotely and those in the office with innovations like AI-powered cameras. More than 60% of the Fortune 500 have chosen Teams Rooms to connect employees across the hybrid workplace. We're also building a completely new suite with Microsoft Veeva as we create a new employee experience category. This is both a priority for our customers and an expansive and high-growth TAM for us. 25% of the Fortune 500 already use Veeva as organizations increasingly recognize that employee experience and well-being are essential to their productivity. We have seen broad adoption across segments and industries from Commonwealth Bank, Fidelity Investments and Mastercard to AstraZeneca and Schlumberger. And this innovation is driving revenue growth across Microsoft 365. Asahi, Expedia Group and Qualcomm all chose our premium offerings to transform how employees work. E5 seats increased more than 60% year-over-year. Now on to Windows. With Windows, we are putting people at the center to help them securely work, connect and play. Despite a changing market for PCs during the quarter, we continue to see more PCs shipped than pre pandemic and are taking share. And we are seeing higher monthly usage of Windows 11 applications with increased time spent across creative work, collaboration, gaming, media and writing code as people rely on the PC for its unique productivity capabilities, rich interactive experiences and to stay connected. We are transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Azure Virtual Desktop monthly active usage increased nearly 60% year-over-year. One year in, we are seeing strong adoption of Windows 365 from organizations in every industry from Hamburg Commercial Bank and Kyndryl to LEGO Group and Schroders as they use cloud PCs to rapidly onboard new and temporary employees and speed M&A integration while reducing IT costs. Now on to security. As the rate and pace of threats continue to accelerate, security is the top priority for every organization. We provide comprehensive solutions that integrate more than 50 categories informed by more than 43 trillion signals each day, reducing cost and complexity. We're taking share across all major categories we serve. All up, our security revenue increased 40%. We are the only cloud provider with protection for the top 3 cloud platforms, and we are seeing more and more customers turn to us to protect their multi-cloud, multi-platform infrastructure. Pearson VUE and Vodafone both chose our security stack to protect their digital estate across clouds. And we're going further to help protect organizations. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity governance and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security Experts, the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, for example, will use the service to supplement its own security operations. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among the more than 850 million members, a testament to how mission-critical the platform is to connect job seekers with jobs, learners with skills and marketeers with buyers. We are seeing job candidates and employers alike prioritize skills to more efficiently find and source work. More than 40% of the companies on LinkedIn now rely on skills filters to identify candidates. LinkedIn Talent Solutions surpassed $6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 39% year-over-year. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. We are a leader in B2B digital advertising, and we continue to see customers choose us for higher reach and ROI. More broadly, despite the current headwinds in the ad market, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising as we look towards the long term. We are creating a new monetization engine for the web, an alternative that offers marketeers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions and supports consumer privacy and strong data governance. It starts with our first-party Internet experiences. We are focused on increasing our share and engagement across Edge, Bing and our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. Daily content consumption across Start in categories like news, weather, finance and sports increased 80% since we launched the service 1 year ago. And Edge continues to gain share as consumers use it to save money with our built-in coupon and price comparison features. Our approach extends to our third-party ad network. We closed our acquisition of Xandr last month and now power one of the world's largest marketplaces for premium advertising. With Microsoft advertising, every media and consumer Internet company now has a trusted platform for their own ad innovation and monetization. Just 2 weeks ago, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner willing to build and innovate with them. And with PromoteIQ, we are providing a platform for retailers like Home Depot, Kohl's and Kroger to build their own digital commerce and marketing channels. This quarter, Sephora chose our solution to help build a new advertising revenue stream while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now on to gaming. We offer the best value in the gaming industry. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service includes access to hundreds of games, and Xbox Series S is the most affordable next-generation console. We sold more consoles live to date than any previous generation of Xbox and have been the market leader in North America for 3 quarters in a row amongst next-gen consoles. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are bringing games to new endpoints. Players now can stream Xbox games on Samsung smart TVs. And we partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available for free via the browser. Over 4 million people have streamed the game to date, including over 1 million who were new to our ecosystem. In closing, we are investing in sharpening our focus to help our customers during this critical moment and to capture the massive technological shifts underway. Our portfolio of best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions, along with our durable business models, an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence, make me confident about our opportunity ahead in the coming year. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.9 billion, up 12% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.23 and increased 3% and 8% in constant currency. I'd like to start by discussing the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our results this quarter. First, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, creating an additional headwind beyond what we shared mid-quarter. As a result, for the full quarter, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $595 million and $0.04 per share, beyond our expectations shared in April. Next, extended production setdowns in China that continued through May and a deteriorating PC market in June contributed to a negative Windows OEM revenue impact of more than $300 million. And finally, reductions in advertising spend impacted LinkedIn Marketing Solutions and search and news advertising revenue by more than $100 million. In our consumer business, despite those macro challenges, we drove another quarter of share gains for Windows in the PC market and for Edge in browsers. In our commercial business, Q4 was the largest quarter ever for long-term commitments to our platform. And as you heard from Satya, we saw share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams and security. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 25% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Our record commitment quarter was driven by increases in the number of $100 million-plus Azure and $10 million-plus Microsoft 365 contracts as well as consistent strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 34% and 37% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 28% year-over-year. The remaining portion which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 39% year-over-year, and our acuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $25 billion and grew 28% and 33% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Now back to total company level. As noted earlier, FX decreased total company revenue by 4 points, 2 points unfavorable to expectations. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, gross margin percentage increased slightly as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier was partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud. Operating expense increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by increased investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn and Nuance. OpEx growth included roughly 2 points from the decision to scale down operations in Russia, employee severance and the impact from the Xandr acquisition, which closed in June. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, LinkedIn, sales and customer deployment, and included roughly 6 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. Operating income increased 8% and 14% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased year-over-year to 40%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, operating margins were relatively unchanged as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses were offset by the impact of the Nuance acquisition. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.6 billion and grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $159 million more than expected. When adjusting for the additional FX headwind, overall segment results were in line with expectations. Office commercial revenue grew 9% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth was impacted by some moderation in new deal volume outside of E5, particularly in the small and medium business customer segment. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 12% of our Office 365 commercial installed base. Office commercial licensing was down 32% and 28% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven primarily by a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 9% and 12% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 15% to 59.7 million. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 24% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 31% and 36% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to lower-than-expected growth in new business even as our cloud growth continues to outpace the market. LinkedIn revenue increased 26% to 29% in constant currency, lower than expected as Marketing Solutions was impacted by the slowdown of advertising spend noted earlier. And Talent Solutions was impacted by weaker online job posts late in the quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 12% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.9 billion, increasing 20% and 25% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $309 million, more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were in line with expectations. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40% and 46% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth across customer segments. In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 21% to over 230 million seats, with some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by a greater-than-expected number of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvements in Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 20% and 22% in constant currency, including roughly 7 points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 11% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.4 billion, increasing 2% and 5% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $127 million more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were below our guidance range, driven by the PC and ad trends mentioned earlier. Windows OEM revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Despite the deteriorating PC market, we saw share gains again this quarter and volumes remained above pre-pandemic levels. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 6% and 12% in constant currency, lower than expected due to some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. Surface revenue grew 10% and 15% in constant currency, driven by commercial sales. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by the slowdown in advertising spend noted earlier, partially offset by the inclusion of 3 weeks of results from Xandr. And in gaming, revenue declined 7% and 5% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 11% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 6% and 4% in constant currency, driven by lower engagement hours and monetization in third-party and first-party content, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Segment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by increased usage of Windows Commercial Cloud services. Operating expenses increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, and operating income decreased 5% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $8.7 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.9 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.6 billion, increasing 8%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $47 million, primarily driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, resulting in a negative 3-point impact on EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders, up 19% year-over-year through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $46 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '23. First, effective at the start of FY '23, we are extending the depreciable useful life for server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure from 4 to 6 years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as future asset purchases. Investments in our software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology have resulted in lives extending beyond historical accounting useful lives. This change only impacts the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets. As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year '23 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $3.7 billion for the full fiscal year and approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter. This has been included in the guidance we will provide on today's call. Additional details on the mechanics of the change are in our earnings materials. Second, on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a roughly 4-point impact to full year revenue growth with headwinds in H1 greater than in H2. FX should also decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points. Now to our full year business outlook based on the current macro environment. At every level of the company, we manage performance on a constant currency basis, as we have for many years. Therefore, with the FX volatility we have seen, I will comment on full year in constant currency and in U.S. dollars. We continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Revenue growth will be driven by continued momentum in our commercial business and a focus on share gains across our portfolio. Operating expense growth will be significant early in FY '23 and will moderate materially over the course of the year as we slow the rate of hiring to focus on key growth areas, increase the productivity of prior year headcount investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. And even with this significant level of investment in our future, we expect operating margins based on constant currency to be approximately flat year-over-year in FY '23, excluding the benefit from the latest change in useful life. And in U.S. dollars, we expect FY '23 full year margins to be roughly flat as the useful life benefit is mostly offset by the FX headwind mentioned earlier. And finally, we expect our FY '23 effective tax rate to be roughly 19%. Now to the outlook for the first quarter, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 6 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. Overall, our outlook has the trends we saw in June continue through Q1. Continued weakness in the PC market demand and advertising spend will impact Windows OEM, Surface, LinkedIn and search and news advertising revenue. Our differentiated market position, customer demand across our solution portfolio and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another strong quarter of revenue and share growth, although we expect to continue to see growth moderation in our small- and medium-sized business segment. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth on a flat expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term measure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q1 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from the Nuance acquisition, partially offset by continued margin improvement in Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential decrease on a dollar basis, with normal quarterly spend variability and the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next is segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or US$15.95 billion to US$16.25 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. In our on-premises business, on a prior year comparable, which benefited from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by the slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in low to mid-teens rev growth. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by share growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 25% and 27% in constant currency or US$20.3 billion to US$20.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 3 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption, and our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, although we expect moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits, driven by strong demand for our hybrid offerings offset by the prior year comparable, which included benefit from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. At Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support, partially offset by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 1% and 4% in constant currency or US$13 billion to US$13.4 billion. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-teens, reflecting continued weakness in the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the high single digits. In Surface, revenue should decline in the low single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC should grow in the mid- to high teens, roughly 10 points faster than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, driven by declines in first-party content, partially offset by growth in Game Pass subscribers and consoles. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or to be between US$14.9 billion and US$15.1 billion and operating expense to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between US$13.3 billion and US$13.4 billion. Total company headcount is expected to continue to grow, with 11,000 hires expected to start in Q1, primarily in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, customer deployment and commercial sales. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making $3.2 billion of tax payments related to the TCJA transition tax and the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. In closing, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services and increased commitment to our platform as we remain focused on delivering compelling customer value in this dynamic environment, resulting in continued share gains. As we manage through this period, we will continue to invest in future growth while maintaining intense focus on operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss : Very impressive results in a very difficult environment that we're all dealing with, particularly when it comes to those commercial cloud bookings. And that's where my question lies. You talked about the largest-ever number of big deals that you guys were able to sign in Q4. Typically, we think this type of environment is -- it makes it harder to sign those big deals. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got that done? Was the consolidating impact that Microsoft brings to the market the price performance? And maybe the macro, is that actually a benefit for you guys to close these deals in this type of environment? Or was it just kind of a typical Q4 end-of-year kind of budget flush kind of thing for you guys? And it was absent of the environment or not really related to the environment?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for the question. It was a record even for us, even with the context of Q4. So there's obviously something going on in the macro environment, which does feel that it does play to our strength. There are 2 things at least I've observed. One is the -- whether the bookings number or the Mac deals and the size of the Mac deals and the number of them, I think, speak to very much what we have been talking about for a long time now, which is as a percentage of GDP, IT spend is going to increase because every business is trying to fortify itself with digital tech to, in some sense, navigate this macro environment. So that, I think, is probably what is reflected in those numbers. And then the second aspect is also what you just referenced, which is, we do have every layer of the tech stack, right, whether it's infra, data, hybrid work, security, even Power Platform. In each one of these, we do have this best-of-suite value, which includes best-of-category products. And that is leading to share gains. So if you want to bet on a vendor on a long-term basis where you have that best-of-suite value and then you're able to sort of consume it on your terms, I think that, that's effectively what some of those numbers are indicative of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter. I'd like to follow up a little bit on that. With all the concerns about macro and recession, everyone is trying to understand how cloud and for Microsoft's case, more specifically, IaaS, PaaS offerings and this slowdown in recession, how do you think about Azure's resiliency? How do you think about Azure's exposure to advertising business, consumer Internet and SMB if we do see a real recession?\nSatya Nadella : Yes. Maybe I'll start, and Amy, feel free to add. I mean, overall, we're not immune to what's happening in the macro broadly, right? To Keith's question and your question, Mark, I think I'd say I'd start there because whether it's on the demand side with consumers or SMBs, I think Amy in her remarks talked about some of that even in our results in the quarter. But what's happening with -- in Azure though, is in some sense, businesses trying to deal with the overall macroeconomic situation and doing -- trying to make sure that they can do more with less. So for example, moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty, right? Because -- and in fact, if anything, one of the things that we're seeing is an increased shift towards the cloud. And then, of course, optimizing your bill. We are incenting even our own field to ensure that the bills for our customers come down. And that, in fact, even shows up in some of the volatility in our Azure numbers because that's one of the big benefits of the public cloud. And that's why I think coming out of this macroeconomic crisis, the public cloud will be even a bigger winner because it does act as that deflationary force. So that's sort of what we are seeing in the Azure numbers. We will be exposed to consumer-driven businesses and SMBs. But at some level, our strength as a company is much stronger in the core commercial. So I think that we'll do fine there. The other one is also people building new applications at a completely new frontier. I mean, there are two numbers that I talked about. One is the triple-digit growth in Cosmos DB and triple-digit growth in container app services. You take those two things and you say, what are people doing? People are writing applications at a completely different frontier of efficiency, which is cloud-native serverless container-based types of applications. And so to me, that's another way for you to make sure that your IT spend goes a long way in a time like this.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill : Amy, great to hear the double-digit guidance. I guess many are asking, are you embedding a worsening macro environment or a similar environment that we're in to get to that type of growth?\nAmy Hood : Thanks, Brent. As I said, it's trying to take into account the current macro environment. And as I said, I took what we saw in June, applied it as best we thought we could through the course of the fiscal year. And if you think about how the -- and if you try to look over the course of the year with some of my comments, you'd say, okay, in H1 versus H2, I would point out 3 things that changed a bit over the course of that time. First, of course, if we're talking about USD would be FX, it's a bigger headwind in H1, it's less of a headwind in H2. The second thing I would point to would be OpEx. As we've talked about in H1, we've obviously added 22% headcount this quarter. We still have 11,000 hires that we have starting in Q1. We've still got Nuance and Xandr in acquisitions, and we anniversary a lot of that as we focus our hiring and focus on the productivity of all of the hiring we've done over the past year. And then the OEM comparables obviously get a lot different when you get from H1 into H2. And so as you're trying to think about the shape and how did I consider it, I sort of took those things into account, thought about the trends we've been seeing in June and applied them as best we can.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead : I'd love to probe a little bit more on Azure. Amy, you and Satya talked about very robust large new deal activity. I thought your guidance for Azure constant currency growth in the September quarter of a 3-point decel to 43 is fairly solid. But you did mention that in the June quarter, you experienced a little bit of consumption softness. Do you mind explaining what that was? And when you put all this together, how you're feeling about the Azure business in the next couple of quarters in terms of the slope of the likely deceleration?\nAmy Hood : Thanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start, and then, Satya, you obviously should add on to the commentary. I would point you, Karl, really to some of the things Satya mentioned, which is, and we said in our comments, we did see some deceleration, a point a little more than we had expected in the consumption side through the course of Q4. It really applied across all customer segments and, in general, applied across geographies. You saw customers, as Satya discussed, much like they always do, focus on optimization and continuing to think about which new workflows to prioritize and start. We've really taken that frame and applied it as we thought to H1 and specifically to Q1 in that guidance. It does assume continued consumption deceleration of 3 points quarter-to-quarter. I still feel very good about the patterns we're seeing. I feel good about the workloads that Satya mentioned and where we feel like we can take some share. But at the same time, we really are focused on taking the agreements that we signed in Q4, making sure we're working with the customers on deployment, projects that have quick time to value, investing to make sure they're starting the projects that can save them money, that can help them innovate. And I think that's probably our larger focus rather than just the pure consumption number.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Along those lines on the customers kind of having slightly different spending priorities as they kind of try to maneuver this environment, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in Office because, obviously, with Office E5, you're offering a much more comprehensive solution that is kind of getting very, very competitive on several aspects? What are you seeing there in terms of your willingness to -- of customers to kind of use this time to kind of consolidate further?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Maybe I'll just start and Amy, you can add. I mean, the 2 numbers that our usage -- our user growth numbers, right, the 14% growth in the number of seats of Microsoft 365 and then the E5 growth of 60%, I think, speak to, again, that best-of-suite value in the core and in E5. So we're very, very competitive on both of those. And that's what you're seeing in that seat growth.\nAmy Hood : And I think where I would point to maybe, just to add a little bit. As you can see, I do think we've been building momentum really with E5. There's so much value and we've added and continue to add value to the E5 suite. And as that value has become more and more competitive, both at the category level and at the suite level, we are very focused on making sure customers get every bit of value in that SKU. So focus on deployment, increasing usage, moving resources there, some of our investment that we've spent over the past 6 months and looking forward for hiring will be in those areas to make sure we are helping customers get the most out of that SKU, the team and in Q4 and specifically in some of the bookings numbers, E5 was a strong point in terms of both renewals and people adding E5 to their existing contract.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow : Congrats on a strong quarter. Amy, I just wanted to focus in on your comments about capital spending but also just utilization within Azure, and obviously, some of the supply chain issues you mentioned before. Wanted to get a sense of sort of where utilization stands around Azure. And as you think about sort of demand trends relative to supply chain, how are you feeling about sort of where capacity stands right now? And is this actually driving any changes in your customer behavior, whether it be increased focus on reserved instances, et cetera? That would be great.\nAmy Hood : Thank you. Maybe let me start by talking about Q4's capital spend. Obviously, the big driver of our growth this quarter was in data center spend, both new and newbuilds as well as adding capacity to existing data centers. We are seeing, obviously, good demand signal. So hence, we've guided to another strong spending quarter in Q1 in terms of capital. Although it's a sequential decline, I would think about that more as being timing. It's always -- can move around a little bit just based on when builds are complete or when shipments come in. We do feel that we've gotten in a good place on capacity on a global basis and are focused on making sure our customers can drive the new units they need, the new usage they need in those data centers. I don't know, Satya, if you wanted to add on anything to that.\nSatya Nadella : Yes. I mean, I think that you captured it right. And it is also right that customers are using more reserved instances. And so that's like essentially a price discount, right? So that's the kind of optimization that you see. So we're growing -- that growth numbers we are posting in consumption is with all that optimization in place.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne : Amy, you noted a couple of times just seeing some weakness in more of the small business segment. Can you just talk about what's going on there? Is that an opportunity for you all to go in and try to sell more bundles and your suite? I guess how much of a drag has that been? And do you see it getting better or worse? So just if you could add a little bit more color on that part of your business, it would be helpful.\nAmy Hood : That's a great question, Kirk. I did allude to it a couple of times when discussing Office EMS or the Azure per-user service as well as Windows commercial. And of course, that is because it's all related to selling Microsoft 365. And we did see, as I noted, some weakness in new deals, particularly in the SMB segment outside of E5. So to your point, think of them as SKUs are really intended, right, for that type of audience and customer base. And it came from a couple of things, Kirk, one of which we talked about before is that we are -- that is primarily sold through partner. And so we need to make sure we've got the best value props. We've got to make sure the price is right, offers right and make sure that we are tuning that value prop to what small business customers need today, which is great value, and so we'll keep executing that through partner. We're in the middle of that transition we talked about last quarter, and we're still working on it. The second thing is I would also say that is a spot where you tend to see macro weakness show itself, and we alluded to that as well in my comment because while I can't tell you, in particular, which part of that is some of the partner transition work we're doing versus macro, it certainly feels like both. And so that's certainly a spot that we're watching. I think your point around making sure we've got the right feed, which is absolutely do more with less and that we can help both modernize and get great value through the suites. But it's an important caveat to that. And you saw the way it shows itself, as you might notice is you saw the seat growth be a little lighter than you would have expected in the quarter. And then in Q1, that shows itself as a little bit of decel in that Office 365 growth number quarter-to-quarter.\nBrett Iversen: Jesse, we have time for 1 last question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin : I guess I wanted to double down on the consumption commentary with respect to Azure. Specifically, I guess, do you feel as though -- clearly, the guidance, I think, is very -- has a very confident posture. When you think about your visibility into those consumption dynamics, is it that you're seeing customers optimize their spend? Are you seeing them commit to longer duration contracts, and therefore, you kind of [indiscernible] the different linearity of that consumption pace? And then if you think about it on a global basis, are there any different patterns domestically versus internationally in those moderating project starts or just general optimization conversations?\nAmy Hood : Maybe I'll start and let Satya add. When we talked about it, what we saw in June and through the quarter, and then as we're thinking about Q1 is we have seen that deceleration in consumption apply really across customer segments. And in general, it was across geos. I wouldn't point in particular to any specific geo as showing a very different pattern than any other geo. And certainly, we've not applied that logic as we to Q1. I do think it speaks to what Satya and I have said, which is we see customers continuing to optimize, whether that's -- whether it's through reserved instance, whether it's through existing workloads and purchase patterns. And I expect that to continue, which is absolutely what the guide implies. And it implies that these Azure commitments that we signed through the course of the year, because it takes time for it to convert those large contracts until actual consumption and new project growth, as that work gets completed both at the customer and with our help, you'll start to see new projects add as the plus to the optimization that occurs. So it doesn't really -- I would not point to it as being different that we have certainly seen to this point. It's just a consistent deceleration that we've talked about.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, all. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $23 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world\u2019s economic output. Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience, and do more with less. Now I\u2019ll highlight examples, starting with Azure. We are building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build, run, and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter, we helped more customers than ever simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations. And it\u2019s still early days. We are winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry, from Blackrock, to Bridgestone, to Lufthansa, are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure. And we are the market leader for customers\u2019 SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos, Chevron, Fujitsu, and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months. Overall, we are seeing larger, more strategic Azure commitments, from industry leaders, including Boeing, Kraft Heinz, US Bank, and Westpac, who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year. And we\u2019re seeing consumption growth across every industry, customer segment, and geography. Now, to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases, analytics, and governance into one integrated data fabric. Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year. And we\u2019re seeing strong adoption of Purview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Boerse to EY, customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform. In AI, we continue to see strong usage of Azure Machine Learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year, with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell. And our Azure Open AI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers. Now, to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly, every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users, including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups, as well as the world\u2019s most established enterprises. 90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact, Mercedes Benz, for example, is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20,000 employees to build, ship, and maintain software. Now, on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past twelve months, up 72% year-over-year, making it one of the fastest growing businesses, at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low code/no code app development, and Power BI has more than 200,000 customers. And our acquisition of MINE-it adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency. Now, to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example, in a world of supply chain constraints we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We are leading innovation in the new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IOT, Digital Twins, Connected Spaces, and Mixed Reality applications. And we\u2019re further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365, Teams, and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. When it comes to industry, our six industry clouds, are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical, imaging, and medtech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow. And with our acquisition of Nuance, I\u2019m excited about our opportunity to apply the company\u2019s deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance\u2019s business, and our industry clouds. Now, on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement, as more than 830 million professionals used the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. Amid the Great Reshuffle, we\u2019re seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market, hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%. Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities, using tools like Newsletters to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least one newsletter on LinkedIn, up 51% over the past quarter alone. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last two years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization, from the boardroom to the frontline, to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft, with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, and the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business. Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60%, compared to a patchwork of single point identity, productivity, collaboration, and meetings solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We\u2019re seeing growth in every segment, including very small businesses with Teams Essentials. Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk, there are over 1,000 third-party apps available the Teams app store. And companies in every industry, including CBRE, CVS Health, and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, have built custom line of business apps within Teams, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. And we\u2019re adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms, Teams Phone, and Microsoft Viva. Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office, with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Blum, Cerner, and Marks & Spencer. This quarter, we added LinkedIn\u2019s Glint employee engagement tool to Viva, ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across the private and public sector, including American Family Insurance, the Queensland Government, and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work, life, and play. The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last eight quarters, and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11, we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release. With Windows 365, we\u2019re bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers, enabling businesses like Lands\u2019 End, SES, and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between Cloud PC and the local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton, and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop. In consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks, from browsing and searching, to learning, and gaming, and shopping, all with security and privacy built-in. We are seeing strong engagement, with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content, consumption, and commerce, as we generate new opportunities for content creators, as well as advertisers. And our browser, Microsoft Edge, continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely. Now, to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell. And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, across clouds and platforms, informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day. This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyber attacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government, as well as other public sector agencies. Multi-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security, we are the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry\u2019s top three cloud platforms. In identity, we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management, the number of Windows, Android, and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year. And we\u2019re expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business, which helps keep small businesses secure. This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All up, the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, Petronas, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry. Now, on to gaming. Our ambition is to power gamers to play when, and how, and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles, we have taken share globally for two quarters in a row and we are the market leader this quarter among the next gen consoles in the United States, Canada, UK, and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. To date, more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles, including Flight Simulator are now accessible on phones, tablets, low-spec PCs for the first time. Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console, including more games from third-party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months, up 45%. And with Azure, we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build, host, and grow their games. New capabilities speed time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue fiscal year to date increased 66%. In closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models, built on a common tech stack, position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $49.4 billion, up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call. First, Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition which closed on March 4. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share, including purchase accounting, integration, and transaction related expenses. Within our results, unless specifically noted otherwise, Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY2022 and accretive in FY2023 to non-GAAP EPS. Second, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. Finally, the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue and we expect that it will decline significantly. The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense, resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue, operating income, and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier. Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better than expected growth in large, long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points. Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue, across both the Office and Server businesses, was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our Open Licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% in constant currency to $155 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond, the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. Commercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency, again ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across the cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our consumer business, as you heard from Satya, we saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles, and our Edge browser. Now back to the company level. As noted earlier, the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations, decreased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations, and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level, headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, customer deployment, LinkedIn, and sales, and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance. Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency in line with expectations. Better than expected results across Office 365, LinkedIn, and Office consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX, the Open Licensing transition, Russia, as well as lower than expected results in Dynamics. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly 345 million, with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365. Office commercial licensing was lower than expected, down 28% and 25% in constant currency, driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 58.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments. LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better than expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes approximately four weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected, revenue results were ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings partially offset by the Open Licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion, increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency, above expectations driven by better than expected performance in search and Windows offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%, with continued strength in the commercial PC market, which has higher revenue per license. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by consumer channel, partially offset by strength in commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency, better than expected, benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine. And in Gaming, on a high prior year comparable, revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower engagement across the platform, even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.3 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20.0 billion, up 17%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio, and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders. First, FX; with the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. Second, my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface, and Xbox hardware. Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis. With that context in place, let\u2019s turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across the solution portfolio, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point driven by continued improvement across our cloud services partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Next to segment guidance; in Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by a point or two on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high-20s driven by the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable, which included 4 points of benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition, as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. In more Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China, which have negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single digits driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market where revenue per license is higher. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low-double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in low-double digits. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits driven by lower engagement hour\u2019s year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. Similar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. We expect to close FY22, even in a more complex macro environment, with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year. With strong revenue growth, share gains, and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look toward FY23, our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Now, Brett lets go to Q&A.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Amy. We will now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call we request the partisans please only ask one question. Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys so much for taking the question, and really impressive results. And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there. Definitely from the stock market perspective, but if we think about interest rates, we think about inflation, there\u2019s a, a conflict going on in Europe right now. It does seem to be a tough backdrop. You guys are operating super well. I mean, the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome. And so if I\u2019m not mistaken Office 365 commercial accelerated as well in the quarter, so really impressive results. But I think the question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence and the durability of this growth given how volatile this macro backdrop is? Is it conversations you are having with customers? Is it what you see in the backlog? Maybe if you could give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide, to put out those healthy comments for FY23, what are you seeing that could maybe help us give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start. Maybe at three levels Keith, one is just the competitiveness of our tech stack all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the commercial cloud and as well as how we are able to monetize for example, the install base of our consumer franchises as well. So both of these places we feel we are competitive and increasingly so coming out of the pandemic to gain share. I\u2019d also say that in many of these places, we have price leadership. I mean, take the one point I made which is, if there is any macro-headwind where you have more value for less price means you win. And in our case, when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings we have significant advantages on that across the stack. The second thing is in the conversations we are having with our customers. The interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges whether macro or micro is no, I don\u2019t hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects is the place for cuts, if anything, some of these projects are the way they\u2019re going to accelerate their transformation or for that matter automation for example. I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software. So that\u2019s the second micro thing the tone thing that\u2019s different. At the end of the day though, I mean, none of us here are trying to forecast macro. So all we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in a large, as a percentage of GDP tech spend is on a secular basis by the end of the decade going to double. We just want to keep driving usage, driving share and be competitive, so that\u2019s kind of how we view what we are doing. And that\u2019s where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays, whether it\u2019s OpEx or CapEx. So I don\u2019t know if Amy, if you want to add to that.\nAmy Hood: I think the only thing Satya, I might add is, I think we\u2019ve always and I think we\u2019ve used this language quite frequently focused on the long\u2013term opportunity. You talked about it as the TAM that we\u2019re focused on. I would say also, there\u2019s still a lot of that TAM left to go \u2013 left to go after and it is quite early, still. And the transitions you\u2019re talking about from a digital transformation perspective, from an automation perspective, from a type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made. And so I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side. But I would also say to your point, we\u2019re investing for a long-term opportunity and our confidence that that long-term outcome is right is where the \u2013 is I think the basis for where you and I are talking, giving this answer from.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Great quarter.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith, Jesse, next question please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Amy on your guidance, are you changing any of your close rate considerations or adding more supply chain constraints into that or is this the same guidance methodology that you you\u2019ve been giving us in the past?\nAmy Hood: I assume we\u2019re specifically talking about most of the guidance in the more personal computing segment where the supply chain constraints, which are specifically related to the production shutdowns in China. I generally follow the same principle I try to follow, which is I give you my best knowledge as of today. I did note and tried to do that with a lot of clarity that were the production shutdowns to extend into May, there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position. As you know, on the OEM business, that revenue is recognized at the point of production and then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface it\u2019s a sell-in. So production delays even earlier in May can obviously have big impact on the quarter. So we\u2019re watching it and I\u2019ve tried to make that transparent in the guidance, outside of that my guidance is reasonably consistent with how I \u2013 with how I like to do it.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thanks.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Jesse, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter and on the strong guidance, I think it\u2019s going to not just help the stock, but hopefully help a little bit more across into the industry. I\u2019d like to look at Office which had strength probably more than people expected. Where are we in the up-sell opportunity from E3 to E5? And can you give us any sense of the sizing of how much of the growth not just now, but going forward do you think is going to come from frontline users? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Maybe I\u2019ll start answering that question and Satya if you want to add, add anything. Very specifically Mark, I would say, this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few. Seat growth while across all segments was especially good in frontline worker and SMB. That did mask a little bit as it often does the ARPU improvement, given those tend to be lower priced SKUs, the ARPU improvement that we\u2019re seeing from the transitions into E5. The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity. I would say, we\u2019re in the earlier transitions of that show in terms as, I think, about going forward there is certainly still room for both seat growth specifically and frontline worker, as you noted as well as SMB. And then ARPU expansion through the E5 transition. The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer is really the value that is available to customers in E5, whether that is security, whether it\u2019s compliance, whether it\u2019s phone, whether it\u2019s analytics, the value of that suite, and if you think even more broadly, the value of Microsoft 365, which adds in more components around Windows. I think we are offering high value and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment. I don\u2019t know Satya if there is anything you would add to that.\nSatya Nadella: No, you counted well, Amy. I mean, I think, the fundamentals are pretty strong here still, whether it\u2019s E5 growth, SMB growth, frontline worker, I\u2019d also add emerging markets. I mean, this is the first time I feel that we have products that fit just emerging markets like Teams Essentials, where we can even really penetrate markets that we\u2019ve never sold anything in the past. And then the new growth engines that you talked about, Teams Phones, Teams Rooms, Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can again, drive growth from. And the point about sort of our value is probably a very, very strong in a time like this in particular. And we see it like the one thing also I\u2019d say is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere. And so that\u2019s the other thing, is we definitely will optimize for driving usage and deployment and that\u2019s going to be our priority.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Congrats.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Mark. Jesse, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Amy, you called out some transactional weakness, which in the March quarter we can see in the on-prem Office segment and in your guidance in the server products, you suggest we might see it there too. Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific, as you describe in your comments, your transitioning customers off your Open License program? Or do you feel like that\u2019s a broader issue where maybe we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we\u2019ve seen before? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. That\u2019s a very good question. I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter anymore, so than it normally does in terms of the normal transitions. We\u2019ve seen to your point on Office or frankly, even in server, as we have people move those workloads and migrate those workloads to the cloud. This really was very significant. Think of it as a where partners transact. And we have such a broad, and valuable, and really needed partner community that is very vast. And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1. And we executed the change on January 1 as plan, and it\u2019s just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to in the program. So, I do think it\u2019s going to take us longer than we thought, we\u2019re going to continue to see that impact in Q4. And I know the teams are working hard to make sure that partners get comfortable with the new system, which is important to us.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it.\nSatya Nadella: And the only thing I\u2019d add is that this change is super good for both the partners, the customers and Microsoft long-term.\nAmy Hood: Absolutely.\nSatya Nadella: So, there is execution ahead, but we want to do this because it benefits everybody.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Thanks Satya.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Karl. Jesse, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. Satya handful of infrastructure software companies have commented that their consumption activity actually started to slow a few months ago. And so, I\u2019m curious what in your view is allowing your Azure trajectory to show better resilience. And do you in fact, see some of the newer products kicking in such as Azure or Synapse Cognitive Services, OpenAI and perhaps contributing to the strength and health and resiliency of that Azure number?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I mean, what I\u2019d say Karl [ph] is that what we are seeing is a classic what happens with consumption meters, right, which is they grow, and then they get optimized and they grow again both existing and new. And so, it\u2019s sort of, will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced quarter-over-quarter. But if I walk up, one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments, right? So small business and enterprise, is it coming from all regions? And it is. We also look at the type of workloads it\u2019s coming from. And so it looks healthy in all of those. And if you walk up the stack to your point on the infrastructure side, the Tier 1 workloads is where I think we are seeing some big Tier 1 workloads, and I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving. The second thing I\u2019d say is on the past services and our DevFest that\u2019s another area where we have differentiated value. So we see good growth there. Data and AI for sure, I mean, the thing that I find really to be something that I think the long run is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric, because we are the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that\u2019s fully integrated into an analytics engine that\u2019s fully integrated into governance. And that increasingly is going to become more and more important, right? I mean you can be dealing with this a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that. So we have a very differentiated offer and I talked about some of the growth numbers there. The AI inference is also finally kicking. They\u2019re very small today, but even when I look at the total com \u2013 that\u2019s just essentially a compute meter, there\u2019s growth there. So overall, I think we will see quarter-over-quarter, some cyclicality, depending on which customers. In fact, we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should. So given that we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen, but overall we\u2019re still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and users, essentially cloud infrastructure and compute is sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Jesse, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much. Congrats on a spectacular quarter. Satya, I have very clearly on your comments and particularly you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next seven, eight years or so. Nobody could have really predicted maybe besides yourself, that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time relative to say five, six years back. So as you look forward, what part of the Microsoft tech stack do you think is underrepresented in the digital word and has therefore more opportunity to gain as you build out your thesis on tech as a percentage of GDP doubling. Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: I mean the thing that I always go back Kash is that all enterprise value at least as far as I can tell, gets created at three layers of the tech stack. What happens with infrastructure, whenever something can be 10x better. So for example, when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge, multi-cloud, infrastructure remaining one of the leaders, that\u2019s going to be a massive EV creation as a percentage of GDP tech spend double. So that\u2019s where everything from Azure, Azure, our database, our \u2013 all of that\u2019s super important. The other one is, this is sort of age of AI. In other words, the core business logic is not being written. It\u2019s being written by software. So when I look at, when I use get up co-pilot, that\u2019s the therein lies the future of what how all business logic gets written. And so to me the AI layer, both the training, supercomputers, as well as the inference layer that\u2019s a place where you\u2019ll see us integrate what today you all consider to be two different businesses, whether it\u2019s Azure and Windows, they\u2019re just one business to me, because to me, where in training happens, where inference happens will be written once by developers. And then it\u2019ll light up across this distributed fabric. So that\u2019s another place where I think there\u2019s tons of enterprise value that\u2019ll get created over time. And then of course the UI layer always is the biggest one. And the next inflection point, whether it\u2019s what happens with MetaWare, so what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on. So these three things translated into workloads and what we call our customer solution areas are the ways that at least we are investing in.\nKash Rangan: Fascinating. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Jesse, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and great job with the results. Azure growth and commercial booking strengths stand out. You mentioned a step down expected in Azure growth in Q4, but still suggest very impressive growth at that scale. Can you expand on the large deal commentary the longer-term strategic deals you\u2019ve referenced a few times over the past couple of quarters, how those impact visibility or maybe the approach to framing targets there? And anything you can add just around how the addition of Nuance helps the cloud business and the industry cloud approach as well is greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Satya, do you want to start with your comments maybe on Nuance overall, and then \u2013 and I can address sort of how the larger long-term contracts.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Sure. Just a couple of quick things. One is on the strategic commitments that are being made. We are sort of working at them workload at a time, and so we feel very, very good about both the type of workloads. In fact, I \u2013 there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server that are migrating, but the most exciting thing is the type of Tier 1 workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that\u2019s running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure. So that\u2019s the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals. On Nuance, for me, the thing that\u2019s exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI driven applications that are getting deployed, whether it\u2019s in healthcare or even in the enterprise contact center. So we are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family. You\u2019ll see us pretty aggressively go innovate there and grow the impact of these solutions in both what is sort of the large percentages of our GDP, like healthcare where I think things like tackling issues like physician burdens with new innovative solutions is much needed and we are really looking forward to exercising that.\nAmy Hood: And Michael, maybe specifically you\u2019re absolutely right. I tend to mention the impact of large long-term Azure contract, both in the context of commercial bookings and some volatility we often can see in that because of it. But really, I think the way we think about them maybe outside of this phone call, is that it\u2019s the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value. And so we go workload by workload, opportunity by opportunity and I think that\u2019s what you were inferring a bit is that it\u2019s almost the top of the funnel to create value for the customer. We call it delivering success to make sure they\u2019re spending the dollars the most effective way, making sure we\u2019re tackling the hardest problems that they need solved. And with that comes our investments that we\u2019ve made and deployment resources and usage resources specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers. And so you\u2019re right to say, I do talk about them in terms of volatility they create, what it creates inside the company is the beginning of a commitment to make sure we\u2019re tackling the workloads and the solutions that the customers want to make happen across all the workloads frankly that Satya has talked about today.\nMichael Turrin: The great complimentary points also highlight. Thanks very much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Michael. Jesse, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, and many thanks. I wanted to break it up into two parts. But I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the strength of the PC market as you look out over the course of the calendar year, if you focus on the demand side equation, not the supply side of the equation. And really the more important related part is given the outlook that you may have for the PC market. How are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business? In particular, if you comment on the fundamentals related PC market, but also the opportunities to keep mixing up, so to speak helped by Microsoft 365. Many thanks.\nSatya Nadella: So let me\u2026\nAmy Hood: Why don\u2019t you start and I\u2019ll add on.\nSatya Nadella: Perfect. So I think on the commercial side, I think it\u2019s well understood is that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365. We have tremendous value, Amy referenced this earlier. In fact, we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 365, that\u2019s resonating super well. The customer sat adoption rates when it comes, whether it\u2019s security, whether it\u2019s our productivity, we feel good about the commercial business. So we\u2019ll stay focused on it on the commercial side. And on the consumer side, the coming out again the pandemic, the intensity of the usage has gone up. So one of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks is just the usage, right? So where \u2013 when you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft start, that\u2019s not the type of engagement we had. And so with a large installed base now, we have a significant room there, the browser share growth, we have significant room there. And then, of course, the subscription attaches whether it\u2019s gaming or whether it\u2019s productivity or suites. So that\u2019s kind of how I look at what we are going to do at least in the immediate future. PC remains a very important category and I think people\u2019s lives is what we\u2019ve discovered during the pandemic. And if anything, the intensity of usage is increased. And there will be cyclical demand that we\u2019ll go through. But the number of use cases is definitely, I think, structurally increased.\nAmy Hood: Exactly. I think the one thing I would add on your demand side, we have seen the transition from, I would say, in the middle of pandemic, definitely a consumer driven demand cycle. We\u2019ve transitioned that to be a commercial part of the demand side. And so I do expect that to be the case, obviously, I think this is the second quarter in the row. We\u2019ve seen that transition expect Q4 to be even more of that. And then we\u2019ll wait and see how the second half of the year shapes up.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Many thanks. Congratulations.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, everyone.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $22 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. We are living through a generational shift in our economy and society. Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world's disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life. We are innovating and expanding our entire portfolio across consumer and commercial segments to help people and organizations thrive in this new era. Now I'll highlight examples, starting with Azure. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need a distributed computing fabric to build, manage, secure and deploy applications anywhere. We have more data center regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services while meeting data resiliency requirements. We're extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge, helping operators and enterprises create new business models and deliver ultra-low latency services closer to the end user. AT&T, for example, is bringing together its 5G network with our cloud services to help General Motors deliver next-generation connected vehicle solutions to drivers. Our Azure Arc customer base has tripled year-over-year. We are now helping thousands of organizations from BP to Rabobank unify their on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure. And as the digital and physical worlds come together, we are seeing real enterprise metaverse usage, from smart factories to smart buildings to smart cities, we are helping organizations use the combination of Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh to help digitize people, places and things in order to visualize, simulate and analyze any business process. Ecolab, for example, is using these tools to build its own platform to model and optimize water management. Across Azure, we are seeing growing adoption across every sector. CVS Health, Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, Kyndryl and Wells Fargo all chose our cloud as their preferred provider this quarter. Now on to data. From best-in-class databases and analytics to AI and data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Data volumes and transactions increased over 100% year-over-year. With Azure Synapse, we are removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics, so anyone can collaborate, build and manage analytics solutions. Data governance is emerging as an important and growing category. And Azure Purview is leading here, helping thousands of organizations achieve a more complete understanding of their data estate. In AI, we have one of the most powerful supercomputers in the cloud, and we're using it not only to train new models, but to deliver them as platforms to our customers. Our new Azure OpenAI Service is in preview and that brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. GitHub Copilot is using this capability to help developers write better code. More broadly, we continue to see strong usage across our Cognitive Services, with over 30 million hours of speech transcribed last quarter, up nearly 2x compared to a year ago. Now to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, to Azure PaaS services, we have the most popular tools to help every developer going from idea to code and code to cloud. As companies prioritize embedding security into their developers\u2019 workflow, we\u2019re investing across GitHub to secure open source. Increasingly, every DevSecOps workflow will start with GitHub Advanced Security, and we\u2019re seeing strong demand from both digital natives like Afterpay and Mercari, as well as established companies like 3M and Bosch. And organizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our PaaS services, like Container Apps and Chaos Studio, to streamline development and build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. Now, to Power Platform. Low code/no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization\u2019s digital capability building. We\u2019re innovating to help organizations like Airbus, Centrica, and Johnson Controls rapidly scale their use of Power Platform, using end-to-end suite to automate workflows, create applications, build virtual agents, and analyze data. At H&M, more than 30,000 employees have used Power Platform to drive productivity gains. They\u2019ve created more than 1,500 applications, flows, and dashboards to date, for everything from managing office capacity to tracking team goals. And, at Kroger, more than 420,000 associates are using our Return to Workplace solution, which is built on Power Platform, to verify their health and vaccination status. Now, on to Dynamics 365. To counter demand shocks and supply constraints in this economy, every business will need to become a hyperconnected business, unifying data, process, and teams across the organization. Across Dynamics 365, we continue to take share, as companies turn to our expanding portfolio of business applications to address these and other challenges. With Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, we are creating a new software category to help organizations manage physical operations across diverse industries, from real estate, to retail, to factories, and construction. Companies like Chipotle and Home Depot are relying on our new Customer Experience Platform to take control of their data, connecting customer touchpoints to deliver more personalized experiences. Daimler Trucks North America is using Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights to preempt supply chain issues. And, just yesterday, we announced a new Logistics as a Service offering with FedEx, combining data and insights from the company\u2019s network with Dynamics 365 to help brands better fulfill, ship, and service customer orders. Now, on to industry solutions. Just over a year ago, we introduced our first industry cloud offering, bringing together industry-specific customizations with our entire stack to help customers improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. We now have six industry clouds, and they\u2019re driving significant increases in usage across the Microsoft Cloud. Our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF, with retailers from Ahold Delhaize and GNC are sharing how they\u2019re using our solutions to deliver seamless customer experiences. Our Cloud for Sustainability unifies data to help customers record, report, and reduce their carbon emissions. Industry leaders, including Nissan Motor, are turning to the offering to help meet sustainability goals. Now, on to LinkedIn. We are experiencing a Great Reshuffle across the labor market, as more people in more places than ever rethink how, where, and why they work. In this new economy, LinkedIn has become mission critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with employers, learners with skills, and sellers with buyers. Last quarter, we once again saw record engagement. And LinkedIn has become one of the world\u2019s largest platforms for professional events, with more than 24,000 events created and 1.5 million RSVPs each week. Confirmed hires were up 110% year-over-year, and we added tools to make it easier to discover open roles that align with how and where people want to work. With entrepreneurship on the rise, our new Service Marketplace has helped nearly 3 million freelancers and small businesses discover new clients. We also saw strong growth in LinkedIn Sales Solutions, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months for the first time. Our Sales, Talent, Marketing, and Premium Subscriptions lines of business have now all reached this milestone. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Every organization today needs a digital fabric to connect and empower everyone inside and outside the organization, from knowledge and frontline workers to customers and partners. At the center of this digital fabric is Teams, which surpassed 270 million monthly active users this quarter. Organizations are using Teams to run their business with collaborative applications that bring business process data right into the flow of work. Monthly usage of third-party applications and custom-built solutions has grown 10x in the last two years, with new and updated apps this quarter from Atlassian, Monday.com, SAP, and Workday. United Airlines is using bots within Teams to create tighter connections between operations and flight crews. And Marks & Spencer used Power Apps and Teams to streamline internal help desk requests. As hybrid work becomes the norm, every organization will need to rethink their approach to space. With Teams Rooms, we\u2019re bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help people stay connected and participate fully in meetings from anywhere. The number of active Teams Rooms devices more than doubled year over year. And with Mesh for Teams, we\u2019re bringing the metaverse to Teams, helping employees at organizations like Accenture access a shared immersive experience where they can have watercooler-type conversations, and even whiteboarding sessions. Teams is rapidly becoming the standard for unified communications. Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies used Teams Phone this quarter, and we continue to take share across PSTN and VOIP as organizations like Bank of Montreal, Chevron, General Motors, LVMH, and NetApp turn to Teams to meet their internal and external collaboration needs. All-up, we\u2019re seeing Teams growth in every segment, from frontline worker usage up 2x year-over-year. Zebra Technologies will bring Teams Walkie Talkie communication to devices used by millions of employees on retail floors. And Walmart chose Teams for their more than 2 million frontline workers this quarter. And we\u2019re expanding our opportunity with Teams Essentials, the first standalone Teams offering specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses. It\u2019s early days, but we\u2019re already encouraged by strong demand. With Microsoft Viva, we\u2019re creating a new employee experience category, combining communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights to help people feel connected to the company\u2019s mission and culture. Now broadly available, Viva is being used by more than 1,000 paid customers including Blum, Nationwide, and REI to help address challenges like employee burnout and retention. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. From Heineken to Hilton, to Zurich Insurance, organizations continue to choose our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. We\u2019ve seen a structural shift in PC demand. More than ever, people are turning to PCs to exercise their agency and unleash their creativity, whether it\u2019s meeting in virtual reality or for remote work, writing code or collaborating in documents, livestreaming video or playing games, or for graphic design and engineering design. As new use cases are born every day, and existing ones see a resurgence, we\u2019re experiencing a PC renaissance, with increases in time spent on PCs, and PCs per household. Three months in, we\u2019re delighted by the response to Windows 11. We\u2019re seeing more usage intensity and higher quality than previous versions of our operating system. And Windows took share this quarter. We are delivering Windows in new ways to meet evolving customer needs. This quarter, we introduced Windows 11 SE, a cloud-first operating system purpose-built for schools. And, with Windows 365, we are bringing the operating system to the cloud, helping businesses like Coats North America and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. There are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they\u2019re a powerful on-ramp for both our first-party and third-party services. Windows 11 users engage with the Windows app store at nearly 3x the rate of Windows 10. And, across Bing and Edge, we are creating differentiated, high value experiences for consumers and advertisers in key verticals, including shopping. Just one year since the launch of coupon and price comparison features in Edge, we already have surfaced more than $800 million in savings.  More broadly, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising. Over the past 12 months, our total advertising revenue, inclusive of LinkedIn, surpassed $10 billion ex TAC. And with our acquisition of Xandr, we will bring to market new advertising solutions that combine our deep audience understanding and customer base with Xandr\u2019s large-scale data-driven platforms. Now, on to security. Cybercrime is the number one threat facing every business today. Our aim is to help organizations implement a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture that protects people, devices, applications, and data holistically across their heterogenous cloud and client environments. We protect our customers in two interconnected ways: First, we incorporate security by design into every product we build. And, second, we deliver advanced end-to-end cross-cloud, cross-platform security solutions, which integrate more than 50 different categories across security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, informed by more than 24 trillion threat signals we see each day. Among analysts, we are a leader in more security categories now, 19 than any other provider. Our multi-cloud, multi-platform innovation is driving growth. Across commercial and consumer, more than 1 billion monthly active users now rely on a Microsoft Account to securely access their favorite products and services with just one login. More than 15,000 customers now use our cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, to stop threats before they happen, up over 70% year-over-year. And, all-up, the number of customers that use our advanced security solutions accelerated this quarter to over 715,000. More than half have 4 or more workloads, up 75% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. On average, customers save 60% compared to multi-vendor solutions. As a result of our customers\u2019 trust, our security business revenue surpassed $15 billion over the past 12 months, up nearly 45% year-over-year. Now, on to gaming. The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years are paying off. We saw record engagement, as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. Our differentiated content is driving the service\u2019s growth, and we released new AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. 18 million have played Forza Horizon 5 to date. And more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history. And with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard announced last week, we are investing to make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want, and also shape what comes next for gaming as platforms like the metaverse develop. In closing, as digital technology as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across diverse and growing TAMs with common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture, and sense of purpose. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for questions.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.7 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Earnings per share was 2.48, increasing 22%. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter, and as a result, FX had no impact on total company and segment revenue growth, which was a 1-point headwind compared to expectations. Despite this, we delivered another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth in each of our business segments, reflecting our unique and differentiated market position across a connected portfolio of diverse businesses. In our commercial business, strong execution by our sales teams and partners combined with continued demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings drove significant growth in large, long-term Azure contracts, as well as increased usage of Teams and our advanced security and identity offerings. And in LinkedIn, Talent Solutions benefited from a strong job market again this quarter. In our consumer business, increased PC demand and usage, as Satya highlighted, benefitted our Windows OEM business. Continued advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn Marketing Solutions as well as Search and news advertising. And in a strong holiday quarter for gaming, we saw record revenue and engagement on the platform, with significant growth in Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles, as well as continued demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles. Now to our overall results. Commercial bookings grew 32% and 37% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the large, long-term Azure contracts noted earlier and strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $147 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 26% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 37% year-over-year, highlighting the long-term commitment customers are making to the Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 94%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 32% to $22.1 billion, again ahead of our expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. As noted earlier, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the quarter, FX had no company and segment revenue growth impact, and minimal impact on COGS and operating expense growth. Gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was 67%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven primarily by the improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 14%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, headcount grew 16% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, gaming, and LinkedIn. Operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 1 point year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 3 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.9 billion and grew 19% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue exceeded expectations driven by LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 14%. Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 19% was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 16% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 17%, in line with expectations and consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. Office consumer revenue grew 15%, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 19% to 56.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 29% year-over-year driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 45% and 44% in constant currency. Continued demand for our modern, low-code app development solutions drove another strong quarter with 161% revenue growth in Power Apps. LinkedIn revenue increased 37% and 36% in constant currency, with continued strength in Marketing Solutions, which grew 43% year-over-year as well as better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the strong job market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13%, and operating income increased 24%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $18.3 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue grew ahead of expectations driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services growth of 46% was driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 28% to over 209 million seats. In our on-premises business, revenue increased 6%, in line with expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments. Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 22% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 14%, and operating income grew 26%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $17.5 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM, Surface, and Search and news advertising. Revenue growth included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Windows OEM revenue increased 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the strong PC market noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. As a reminder, these results include roughly 6 points of positive impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to, which shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13% and 14% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue grew 8% year-over-year, ahead of expectations as we were able to ship more devices than anticipated into a strong demand environment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 32%, better than expected, benefiting from the strong advertising market noted earlier. And, we saw share gains in our Edge browser on Windows 10 and 11 devices. And in Gaming, revenue increased 8%, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue grew 4% and 3% in constant currency driven by continued strong demand and better than expected console supply on a strong prior year comparable that included the launch of the Xbox Series X and S. Xbox content and service revenue increased 10%, lower than expected, as strong growth in first-party titles and Game Pass subscriptions was partially offset by weaker third-party title performance. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% year-over-year. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses and improvement in Search and news advertising. Operating expenses increased 17% driven by investments in Gaming, primarily ZeniMax, Search and news advertising, and Windows marketing. Operating income grew 22% and 21% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year, lower than expected, primarily due to quarterly spend volatility in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.9 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion, increasing 16% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds. Free cash flow was $8.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. This quarter, other income and expense was $268 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I\u2019d like to provide a couple of reminders. First, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, although we do expect it to close during Q3. Second, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. With that, let\u2019s move to the third quarter outlook. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Next, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand for our high-value hybrid and cloud offerings, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, growth should be healthy but will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable as well as low growth in the expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q3 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points driven by continued improvement across all cloud services, despite revenue mix shift to Azure. And, on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be slightly down sequentially with normal quarterly variability in the timing of the cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.6 billion and $15.85 billion. In Office 365, healthy revenue growth will be driven by the same factors as Q2 with similar seat growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high-teens, with continued customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single-digits, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the low-30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-20% range driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.75 billion and $19 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be up sequentially in constant currency, driven by our Azure consumption business, with strong growth on a significant base. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, continued demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.15 billion and $14.45 billion. Continued strength in PC shipments, particularly in the commercial segment, should benefit Windows OEM despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in the high single-digits. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double-digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the mid-teens with strength from our premium devices. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens, against a strong prior year comparable that was driven by a recovery in the advertising market. And in Gaming, on a prior year comparable that included significant strength in hardware from our new consoles as well as across Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits with strong engagement and continued momentum across the platform. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion and operating expense of $13.4 billion to $13.5 billion driven by headcount investments in high-growth, strategic areas to drive continued long-term revenue growth. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year expected tax rate of approximately 17%. And finally, for FY22, given our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our current H2 outlook, full year operating margins should be slightly up year-over-year even with the impact of changes in accounting estimates noted earlier and the significant strategic investments we are making to capture the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. In closing, digital technologies are increasingly essential to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more and we are well positioned with innovative, high value products. Our diverse, yet connected portfolio of solutions spans end markets, customer sizes and business models, uniquely enabling us to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth.  With that, Brett, let\u2019s go to Q&A\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the questions and congratulations on a very nice quarter. I wanted to ask you guys a high-level question about the overall demand environment and whether we've seen any changes, given sort of the disruptions we've seen from Omicron and a lot of what's going on in the environment. There's been a narrative among software investors, and a lot of times, the asset prices seem to lead the narrative. So I wanted to check in with you guys on how you feel about the overall demand environment, particularly around digital transformation? And how durable is that going to be into calendar year '22? Do you still see a lot of wood to chop, if you will, a lot of activity taking place in that direction? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith. I'll take that, and Amy you can add on to it. Overall, what we see is pretty strong demand signal. And quite frankly, going into the pandemic, we saw demand increase because of the constraints the pandemic put on corporations and the increased consumer activity.  And then coming out of the pandemic, we are seeing actually a lot of constraints in the economy, and the only resource, as I said in my remarks, that can help drive productivity while keeping cost down is digital tech. So when I think -- take something like Power Apps, it's just a great example of something that's right in the middle of our stack, really helps drive that next level of productivity in the labor force for any company in any industry. And so the demand signals we see across the stack from security to our cloud infrastructure to business applications and solutions like Teams is very strong.  And the other area, obviously, we're seeing strength is in gaming. That's where we have doubled down in terms of our consumer category creation. And we see the intensity of usage and the business model diversity around games that increasingly, the economics of gaming franchises is also radically becoming much more software-like. So we sort of overall see good demand signal across the stack.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And to be clear, the constraints that you talk about for the broader economy, headcount constraints and the like, it doesn't sound like that's constraining your opportunity. You're not kind of running short on people to sell or implement your solutions or not having a hard time finding the people you need to make the investments behind the product. Is that the right read-through?\nSatya Nadella: I mean, there's definitely a very competitive talent market and we are competitive in that talent market. And you see it even in our OpEx projections that Amy shared. We are growing our headcount because we see the opportunity. We are not immune from what happens overall in the labor market, but I think we have a good brand and an attractive brand to both get people and to retain people with everything that we are doing. So - but at the same time, we do want to make sure that in our channel and our ecosystem remain healthy and all the signals at least we are getting is that there are no constraints per se other than at the end of the day, all businesses are going to be subject to the laws of economic growth in the overall economy.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Thank you very much, guys.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the strong growth across the overall business and really nice outlook. Satya, given all the commentary on the metaverse, what are the key components of the metaverse or the multiple metaverses that you're seeing? What does Microsoft have today that they're positioned to be able to deliver to meet those requirements? And what do you believe you might be lacking if the partner ecosystem meet those requirements? And to Amy, with the hype cycle underway and increased industry interest in the metaverse, are you changing your investments to meet the potential opportunity?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you for the question. So the way we see this is as an opportunity in a very classic Microsoft sense, both at the platform infrastructure level and in the application level. So that's why I think even in my remarks, I tried to reference, all the places where we are investing today and seeing customer use cases really develop. At the first place where we see this is the increasing digitization of people, places and things to be able to really help businesses automate processes to the next level. And so today, between Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh, we have many examples where customers are engaged with us. So that's what will show up in Azure and we're investing significantly there. Up the stack, I would say, Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces. That's a solution that's in preview today. That's about really being able to take a retail space or a connected factory or a building and essentially create a complete new software category, which is about managing physical processes, just like CRM and ERP and supply chain management, we now have a suite which is all driven by connected spaces, which is going to automate physical processes. Teams is going to have Mesh meetings. So these immersive meetings, which will start, first of all, on 2D screens, whether it's PCs or phones and then lead up to even immersive experiences if you wear your VR or AR goggles. So that's not of the place. And then, of course, gaming. That will be a natural place for us. And today, if you think about the activity when I talked about the Forza numbers, right, I mean, that's a place where you could say already, people are investing in their avatars. People are building Minecraft worlds. And so very naturally, you can see us extend gaming as the metaverse evolves. On the devices side, one of the things we are very excited to be doing is what we're doing with HoloLens and all the experience we're gaining on the optics, on the silicon side and all the way to the cloud in terms of some of the foundational services driven by all the HoloLens use cases in the enterprise. So that's the broad portfolio. We're going to invest across the entire tech stack. The demand will come in different forms for different categories, but we feel very well positioned to be able to catch. What, I think, is essentially the next wave of the Internet, right? Just like the first wave of the Internet allowed everybody to build a website, I think the next wave of the Internet will be a more open world where people can build their own metaverse world, whether they're organizations or game developers or anyone else.\nAmy Hood: And Mark, maybe just add one bit of perspective to Satya's answer, which is I would bring people's attention to the holistic nature in which he answered the question, starting at the platform layer all the way up through the importance of content and app layer in that the investment will show itself in each component as opposed to maybe in one stand below group or team. And it's because I think of the transition Satya just talked about. If it\u2019s that -- if it's at the platform layer and it applies to all the components, it's better to do that, frankly, across the teams where they can apply it in the right way. And I think that's how I would point to the investment showing itself.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Thanks.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrent Thill: Amy, you really underscored the strength ahead on commercial bookings at 37%. Many are asking where you're seeing the strength into your Azure comment for next quarter, obviously, the acceleration what's giving you the confidence? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Interestingly, I would not say that there is 1 location, and I would tie that back to the answer actually Satya gave to Keith's first question, which is if the underlying driver is digitization and our belief that it impacts every industry, every end market, then you'd expect it and the nature of the commitments to show themselves on a global basis and across end markets. And that is, in fact, what we saw in Q2. I continually point out, these can be a little volatile because we really focus on getting the right deal done that matches the customer can move around a little bit as I talked about in Q1. But the execution was very good by the sales team this quarter, but I would not characterize any geo or industry as being different or distinct from others. And for a second, let me then connect that, as you asked, into how to think about the guide for Azure on a constant dollar basis being up sequentially into Q3. I sort of continually remark that these can move around a few points here and there and yet have the consistent sign of consumption be steady. And we saw that again, frankly, Q1, Q2, Q3, consumption growth by end market, by industry, by customer size has remained quite steady. And so while you'll see some volatility in that number, increased data usage, the data products have really been a strong performer. I think South mentioned some of those in his comments. So I do think in some ways, they're connected, but I tend to put bookings execution on the Azure side into a long-term commitment bucket where customers are picking a partner to help them change the cost structure or the outcome structure that Satya talked about. And I tend to put these trend lines on Azure into a bucket called, \"Are we getting projects and successful projects set up at customers around the world?\" And both of those things were very good by the sales teams.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Amy, you started the fiscal year guiding to down margins, including the impact of the accounting change, and 2 quarters in, you're now guiding to up margins. Even with presumably some reversal of work-from-home-related T&E savings, even with what I'm assuming is an uptick in labor cost, can you unpack that a little bit? Is it sales mix where some of the high-margin businesses like Windows have outperformed? I'd love to hear a little color.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. I think it's really a combination of things as it is when you go through a fiscal year. Really, I believe that our execution in a very good demand environment has given confidence. Revenue performance has been quite consistent to your point. We have seen some continued upside in OEM. We've seen strength in gaming. We've seen strength in our Microsoft Cloud products. We've seen good consistency out of Dynamics. I mean, at some level, if you really wanted to look at the trend lines, you'd say this has been a very consistent execution by the team across really both of the business units. And so if you think about then what goes into confidence is when you start to add headcount and you add headcount with goals of ROI and you look at that accountability, I feel like the teams have done a nice job. Where we've added heads, they've been into strong markets. They've executed well. Sales teams have done the same. And then on top of that, Karl, I would say there's been good execution on the gross margin numbers. I tend to be an operating margin-focused communicator with you all and inside the company. But gross margins have also been quite good. The teams have executed well on cost purples through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 Commercial. Obviously, another strong quarter there, both in terms of revenue but also seat growth. And Amy, in your commentary, you highlighted SMB seat performance as well as frontline workers, and Satya mentioned a doubling of the frontline workers year-over-year, which is impressive. But you also commented on revenue per user going up. I wonder if you could help us kind of walk through the growth algorithm here, call it the P times Q, because there are different trends going on both the P and the Q and just sort of how that might be changing going forward versus what you have seen.\nAmy Hood: Sure. Let me take a shot at that 1, Phil. This is 1 where we do have -- it is a P times Q that I think we try to disclose, but there's a couple of currents running through that, maybe take a second to walk you through those. Absolutely on seat growth, I think we are encouraged as we focus on more products that are more specific to the unique scenarios that face small businesses and frontline workers and really bringing the value of Microsoft 365 to them. I think you're even seeing that in offers like Teams Essentials, right? It's a concerted effort to realize the challenges can be different in that part of the market and improving our execution. You're seeing that in continued seat growth over, I would say, I feel good about those numbers, over the past probably 6 quarters with continued good execution on those. Now however, those do often come at lower revenue per month that we would see in our enterprise businesses buying the full suite of products. So in some ways, this very strong seat growth at the frontline worker and small business units do mask some of the progress that we've been making, in particular, I'm thinking offers in the enterprise value props that are really resonating and E5, and Satya may bring up some other ones. He mentioned quite a few in his comments, security, compliance and increasingly, voice as a value prop. And so sometimes, to your point, increasing seats at lower average price points can mask a bit of progress that we're making on ARPUs in the enterprise.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Congrats on another record quarter. Satya, there's a massive skills gap within the IT industry, and it's particularly acute in cybersecurity, where I noticed Microsoft's campaign that kicked off in Q2 to help scale and recruit 250,000 cyber jobs by 2025, which is quite a bold undertaking. Can you comment on the extent to which the gap is filled by people versus products in automation and also the extent to which Microsoft sees cybersecurity as its responsibility versus it being a commercial opportunity that you can continue to monetize?\nSatya Nadella: Great set of questions. On the first one, I think it's, first and foremost, we absolutely need the skills and the people. And for the people to be sort of more evenly distributed in the broader economy, public sector, private sector, people who are working on behalf of small businesses because absolutely, as digital tech becomes more pervasive across IT as well as OT across the economy, I think the cyber threat is just going to be more pervasive and so therefore, we need other people on the skills. And we will do our power to sort of make sure that, that happens in terms of democratizing even how 1 acquires these skills. That's kind of where not that we have to take a broader definition of what these skills are and how one can acquire the certifications. And this is where what we're doing even with LinkedIn, I'm very, very bullish on.  On the product side as well, like something like Sentinel, I do believe, for example, we are now doing very large-scale AI on all of those signals that go into our cloud-native SIEM. And that, I think, is going to help sift through signal from noise and help the productivity of the cyber professionals in any organization. So we are excited about how that workflow gets more efficient. To your point, one of the fundamental responsibilities for us as a platform company is to bi-design. It's all about shifting left on security and building it in to the products. And if anything, when we think about our monetization, our monetization is about really recognizing that the real world is not some homogeneous Microsoft infrastructure world. It is a multi-cloud, multi-platform world. And we will definitely monetize those aspects that we have best-of-breed solutions and suites and offerings. And by the way, as I said in my remarks, the people who are adopting the Microsoft solutions are saving 60%. And so to some degree, there is real time to value and cost savings for anybody who's using our solution. So we're going to be very, very mindful of our responsibility as you said. At the same time, we think we have a security opportunity in being able to secure the entire heterogeneous digital estate of our customers.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my questions. And nice to see continued strength in the business. Maybe I wanted to ask a little bit philosophically, Satya. So the pandemic clearly accelerated everyone's time line to migrate to the cloud, even if there wasn't necessarily a big pull forward there. As we think about a post-Omicron world, where there is some level of office reopenings and visibility into that, how should we think about the potential to see maybe another wave or another acceleration of those cloud migrations with that ability to have in office and have hybrid work? Maybe walk us through that.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I mean, the -- as I said, some of the contours of demand will change. For example, one of the solutions I highlighted is, coming out of the pandemic, we built in Dynamics a Supply Chain Insights module. We were seeing significant demand for what was our customer insights module going into the pandemic because everybody needed to deploy essentially their online presence and use customer data to be able to reach customers, and that's how commerce happened during the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic, we were hit with supply chain issues. So supply chain insights became the most important thing. So that's where the demand picked up. So as I look at our portfolio, we are seeing a slightly different set of solutions. Same thing with Power Platform, right? When you are sort of saying we have a labor force shortage and we need to do more with less, guess what, you turn to more automation tools, and that's where something like Power Platform, especially given you can even train your first-line workers to be able to be app builders and automate workflows. That's proving to be a productivity driver. So we are seeing differences in demand. I think the stable state here would be the structural shift that's happened because of the pandemic combined with even some of these constraints, whether there's supply shocks or others will hopefully go away. But the 1 thing that isn't going to go away is the need for increasing levels of digitization, both in terms of tools that people use to improve the productivity of your OpEx and the COGS you have in your enterprise will probably now have a digital component to it because that's where the leverage of cost will come. So that's what we are betting on. As a percentage -- I always go back to that simple formula. As a percentage of GDP, what is IT spend broadly defined and what is it going to be a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now? It's just going to be more. And we've got to do a good job of seeing the trends before they're conventional wisdom and gaining share. And so that's where we will remain focused.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Rishi. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

We're off to a fast start in fiscal 2022, with Microsoft Cloud quarterly revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, up 36% year-over-year. The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent or more clear. Digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses small and large can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building tech in density. The Microsoft Cloud delivers the end-to-end platforms and tools organizations need to navigate this time of transition and change.  Now, I'll highlight examples of our innovation and momentum, starting with Azure. Every organization will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to rapidly build, manage, and deploy applications anywhere. We are building Azure as the world's computer, with more datacenter regions than any other provider delivering fast access to cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements.  And we're partnering with mobile operators from AT&T and Verizon in the U.S., to Telefonica and BG in Europe, Telstra and SingTel in Asia Pacific, as they embrace new business models and bring ultra-low latency compute power and storage to the network and the enterprise edge. 78% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. And with Azure ANC, customers like Nokia, Royal Bank of Canada and SKF can deploy and run applications at the edge or in multi-cloud environments.  Organizations also prefer our Cloud to power the mission-critical apps they rely on every day. G Healthcare and Procter & Gamble migrated critical workloads to Azure this quarter. And leading companies -- our companies in every industry including Bertelsmann, Kimberly-Clark, the NBA Softbank, Decent Crop, all chose Azure for their SAP workloads. Now onto data, the leading indicator of digital transformation success in an organizations, is organizations that ability to turn data into analytical and predictive bar.  Azure Synapse brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics into a comprehensive solution. With Synpase Link for Dataverse, organizations can analyze data from business applications like Power Platform, and Dynamics 365 with just a few clicks. With Synpase Link for Cosmos DB, they can run real-time, no ETL analytics over their operational data. And with Power BI, anyone in the organization can access these insights. Thousands of active Power BI customers are using Synapse today. More than ever, every business needs a holistic understanding of its data estate. And Azure purview, now generally available is helping organizations such as FedEx, manage and govern on-premise, multi-cloud, and SaaS data. Now onto developers, as every Company becomes a digital Company, they will need standardized tools to modernize existing apps and build new ones. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most used and loved developer tools to build any app on any platform. GitHub, is now home to 73 million developers up 2x since our acquisition three years ago.  More and more businesses are choosing GitHub enterprise to provide their developer teams the most advanced platform to build, ship and maintain software. This quarter alone, we introduced more than 70 enterprise features, 84% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub, and we're seeing growing usage from digital native Companies and the world's most established firms. From Pinterest to Procter & Gamble, from Stripe to Society Generale, we're rapidly innovating in AI and our large-scale models are powering everything, from meeting recaps and Teams, to helping developers code in GitHub, to the next best action in Dynamics 365.  And as machine learning continues to mature, managing the life cycle of models or ML ops has become more prevalent and Azure ML is now the go-to tool for data science teams. And large organizations from Ecolab to Providence Healthcare are relying on Azure AI to better meet customer needs. Now, to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we're helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code, no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. All up, Power Platform now has nearly 20 million monthly active users, up 76% year-over-year.  Power Apps is the undisputed market leader in low-code no-code tools, now with 10 million monthly active users. 91% of the Fortune 500 use the service to build applications, and a 129 organizations have more than 10,000 users, including 3M, EY, GSK, Marks and Spencer, Sony, and ZF Group. Now on to Dynamics 365, going forward, every business process will be collaborative, powered by data and AI, and will bridge the digital and physical world. Dynamics 365 ushers in this hyper-connected business process era.  We continue to gain share with Dynamics 365 and teams we are creating a complete, new category of collaborative applications that help businesses like Rockwell Automation, Willis Towers Watson, surface data and insights across the entire organization. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights leads this category. Customers like, Meyer are using it to create 360 degree view of customers in order to deliver more personalized experiences. All up the number of customer profiles increased a 174% year-over-year. Now on to industry.  Our industry clouds, bringing together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud along with industry-specific customizations to improve time-to-value, increase agility, and lower costs. We're seeing strong customer adoption of our new Industry Cloud for healthcare, and our clients for financial services and manufacturing will become more broadly available next week. Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and for every business today. And when we think about our approach to sustainability, it's more than just the carbon footprint of our own datacenters.  With our Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, we're creating an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor the carbon footprint across their operations. The world's largest baking Company, Grupo Bimbo, for example, is using our tools to report, record, and reduce its emissions in every country where it operates. Now onto LinkedIn, we're experiencing a great reshuffle across the global labor market, as people are rethinking not only where and how they work, but why.  And as more people change jobs than ever before, we saw record engagement as they increasingly turn to LinkedIn to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. LinkedIn now has nearly 800 million members. Confirmed hires on the platform increased more than a 160% year-over-year. And this quarter, we launched new ways to help job-seekers discover roles that align with how they want to work. In a rapidly-evolving labor market, companies are increasingly turning to LinkedIn Learning to up-skill and re-skill their employees.  We now have over 15,000 enterprise customers of LinkedIn Learning, and we are expanding our opportunity in the creator economy, including offering new ways for LinkedIn Learning instructors to build their audiences and connect with learners live. Businesses continue to choose LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals. LinkedIn advertising revenue was up 61% year-over-year. Now onto Microsoft 365 and teams. Flexibility and productivity are not mutually exclusive.  We are innovating to empower people to have impact from home, in the office, and anywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the only solution that supports all the ways people work. Usage has never been higher. A 138 organizations now have more than a 100,000 users of Teams, and more than 3,000, and have more than 10,000 users. Updates to Teams' rooms, including new AI Pod cameras, and spatial audio, ensure every meeting attendee is always a first-class participant. The rise of hybrid work is transforming the enterprise phone market.  And we're taking share across PSTN, and VoIP. Calls originating from Teams chats increased 50% this quarter compared to a year ago. Operator Connect enables organizations to bring their existing service directly into Teams. And leaders in every industry, including Schlumberger, Westpac, ZF Group, REI, and SAP chose Teams  this quarter to meet all their internal and external calling needs. Moving forward, organizations will need a digital fabric that spans organizational boundaries to address key challenges like customer service swarming and supply chain resilience.  With Teams Connect, employees across multiple companies can chat and collaborate as one extended team without switching tenants. In private preview, we're already seeing strong interest in usage from companies like LVMH and WPP. Teams by itself has become a first-class platform for application development. For example, employees at Levi Strauss, an NTT data are using service now, applications right within Teams Drax's critical info within the flow of work.  Organizations are also using Power Platform to build their own rich, collaborative apps within Teams for everything, from curbside pickup to care team coordination. All of the number of organizations with more than 10 thousand users integrating that third-party and line of business applications with teams increased 82% year-over-year. We're creating a complete new category with Microsoft Veeva, which brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights.  Our acquisition of Ally.io, a leader in the fast-growing objectives and key results category, adds new tools to help employees drive outcomes, not just output, in hybrid work. , Old Mutual, PayPal, and Toyota North America all chose  to help strengthen connections between employees and their mission between employees and managers and drive individual empowerment. Across Microsoft 365, we're seeing growth in all segments, including triple-digit year-over-year usage, growth of Teams in front-line.  one of Australia's largest retailers chose Teams to bring two-way communications to more than a 120,000 frontline employees.  And Chevron, H&M, Lumen and St. Jude all turn to our premium Microsoft 365 E-5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice and analytics. Now onto Windows. Earlier this month, we launched Windows 11, the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. When I step back and reflect on the future of how we work, connect, and play, one thing is clear, the PC will be more critical than ever. There has been a structural shift in PC demand emerging from this pandemic, and we delighted with the early response to Windows 11, with every new generation of windows.  We also unlocked the next generation of hardware innovation across our ecosystem. And together with our OEM partners, we are excited to offer the widest choice of Windows 11 devices at every price point in every form factor this holiday. We are providing people and organizations everywhere with the most differentiated devices for productivity, learning, and gaming, and also have massive opportunity to create a new class of applications that take advantage of the edge and AI capabilities in Windows, coupled with cloud.  And Windows 11, is also the most open platform. It's pioneering new store commerce models and policies with both Amazon and Epic Games of bringing their marketplaces to the Microsoft Store. Now on to security. Cyber security is the number one threat facing businesses today. Our goal is to help every organization strengthen its defense through the zero trust architecture built on end-to-end solutions that span all clouds and all platforms. We analyze over 24 trillion signals across email, endpoints, and identities each day and translate this intelligence into innovative features to protect our customers.  We have prevented more than 70 billion attacks over the past year alone. We now have nearly 650,000 customers using our security solutions, up 50% year-over-year. And businesses like  Healthcare and Siemens switched to our security solutions to protect their endpoints. In identity, Azure active directory now has more than 500 million monthly active users, and we have seen usage of third-party apps increase 1.5X year-over-year. And the future of security is password-less.  Nearly 240 million users have adopted password-less login to-date and consumers can now completely remove passwords from their personal Microsoft accounts. And we're not stopping there. Over the next 5 years, we'll invest $20 billion to advance our security solutions and protect customers. Now, on to gaming. We continue to attract new gamers and retain those we have gained over the past year and a half. We saw record first-quarter monetization and engagement.  This holiday season will bring our biggest lineup of content and exclusive games ever, with 3 new AAA titles, including Halo Infinitive available via Game Pass subscription service, which continues to offer the best value in gaming. We're also bringing XCloud gaming to the console for the first time, enabling Xbox users to discover the stream and stream more than a 100 games with just a click. Cloud gaming is now available in 26 countries, including as of this quarter, in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan.  We are expanding our opportunity with independent creators as well as top studios. Updates to Azure PlayFab make it easier for developers to integrate the creator marketplace in games they built. And leading publishers from Bungie to Craften, are all relying on our cloud to scale and operate their games. In closing, we have the most diversified set of digital businesses, and we are innovating to expand our opportunity across the entire portfolio to help our customers in this new era.  Next week, we'll hold our flagship Ignite Conference where we will share the next chapter of Microsoft Cloud from the  to large-scale AI, from hybrid work to hybrid infrastructure. I couldn't be more optimistic about the opportunities ahead. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you Satya and good afternoon everyone. Our First-Quarter revenue was $45.3 billion, up 22% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.27, an d increased 25% and 23% in constant currency when adjusted for a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties this quarter. Our sales teams and partners delivered a strong start to the fiscal year. And our commercial business, customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud. We again saw healthy growth in our Azure consumption-based. business, and increased usage across products, such as Teams and Power Platform, and  reflected in the comments.  In our on-premises business, annuity performance in Office to Server benefited from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts, with higher in-period revenue recognition. And in LinkedIn, the talent Solutions business continued to benefit from an improved job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market, despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We also saw positive demand signals for Windows 11 ahead of launch with nearly all devices built this quarter eligible for upgrade. Microsoft 365 subscription growth drove Office consumer results, advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn, as well as searching News advertising.  And in gaming, we were able to ship more Xbox series X and S consoles than expected, even as demand continues to exceed supply. Let's move to our overall results. Against the strong prior-year comparable commercial bookings grew 11% and 14% in constant currency driven by consistent execution across new, add-on, and renewal sales motions. This Quarter, growth was Impacted by fewer large long-term Azure contracts, which are unpredictable in their timing. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 28% and 29% in constant currency to $137 billion with a roughly equivalent split between revenues that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months.  And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 95%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 36% and 34% in constant currency to $20.7 billion ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact from a change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Microsoft Cloud, gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points, driven by improvement in our Cloud Services, particularly in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.  With the weaker U.S. dollar FX increased total Company Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 2 points. In line with expectations. More personal computing revenue growth was increased by 1 point , less favorable than expected. affects increased cost by 1 point, in line with expectations, and had no impact to operating expense, slightly more favorable than expected. Gross margin dollars increased 21%, and 19% constant currency.  Gross margin percentage was 70%, down slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate discussed earlier, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Cloud Services noted earlier, partially offset by sales mix shift to Cloud. Operating expense increased 11%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total Company level, headcount grew 14% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in key areas, such as Cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, and gaming.  Operating income increased 27% and 24% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded two points year-over-year to 45%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly four points year-over-year. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15 billion and grew 22% and 20% in constant currency, with better -than-expected performance in Office, commercial, and LinkedIn . Office commercial revenue grew 18% and 16% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 23% and 21% in constant currency driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and all customer segments, as well as higher ARPU.  Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings growth continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid office 365 commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and front-line worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 13% and 14% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, benefiting from the higher end period revenue recognition noted earlier. Office Consumer revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency on a strong prior-year comparable, with better-than-expected growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions.  Over the past 2 years, our Microsoft 365 subscriber base has grown over 50%, reaching 54.1 million this quarter. Dynamics revenue grew 31% and 29% in constant currency. Dynamic 365 revenue growth was 48% and 45% in constant currency with continued strong demand for Power Apps, which grew 202% and 197% in constant currency. And in LinkedIn, revenue increased 42% and 39% at constant currency, with continued strength in marketing solutions and better-than-expected performance in talent solutions from the improved job market  earlier.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 22% at 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the Teams accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by improvement across all Cloud services. Operating expense, increased 7% and operating income, increased 33% and 29% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17 billion, increasing 31% and 29% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated, hybrid and Cloud offerings.  Overall several products and cloud services revenue increased 35% and 33% in constant currency. Azure and other Cloud Services grew 50% and 48% in constant-currency ahead of expectations, driven by our consumption based services. The ARPU user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 30% to over 196 billion seats. In our on-premises business on a low prior-year comparable revenue increased 14% and 13% in constant currency ahead of expectations.  Strengthen, our annuity business, was driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments and higher in-period revenue recognition, including benefit from annuity purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 9% and 8% in constant currency driven by growth in Microsoft consulting services and Enterprise Support Services. Technical gross margin dollars increased 28% to 26% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, year-over-year.  Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvements in Azure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense, increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and operating income grew 39% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more personal computing, revenue was $13.3 billion increasing 12% and 11% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance and Windows OEM and gaming.  Windows OEM revenue increased 10% driven by a stronger-than-expected PC market, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. These results include roughly seven points of impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to Windows 11 licenses sold to OEMs prior to general availability. The deferral was lower-than-expected OEMs prioritized upgraded eligible device bills early in the quarter. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 12% and 10% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365.  Surface revenue declined 17% and 19% in constant currency on a strong prior-year comparable. Surge and news advertising revenue, XTech, increased 40% and 39% in constant currency in line with expectations benefiting from the advertising market noted earlier. And in gaming, revenue increased 16% at 14% in constant-currency ahead of expectations, better than expected console supply and continued strong demand. Resulted in Xbox hardware revenue growth of a 166% and 162% in constant currency. Xbox content services revenue increased 2%, and was relatively unchanged in constant currency against a strong prior-year comparable.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expenses increased 15% driven by the ZeniMax acquisition, as well as Windows 11 marketing. Operating income grew 7% and 5% in constant currency. Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.4 billion in line with expectations. and cash paid for PP&E was $5.8 billion.  Our capital investments, including both new datacenter regions and expansion in existing regions, continued to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.5 billion, increasing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong Cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $18.7 billion up 30% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $286 million higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize market-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 16%. And finally we've returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a couple of reminders. First, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Second, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which we now expect to close by the end of Q2 or early Q3.  With that, let's move to our second quarter outlook. In our commercial business, our differentiated market position, compelling solution portfolio, and consistent execution should drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy but impacted by modest growth in the Q2 XFree base and the normal quarterly volatility from large long-term Azure contracts previously discussed. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly two points year-over-year, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate previously discussed.  Hugh gross margin percentage will increase roughly two points driven by continued improvement across our services despite revenue mix shift to Azure. Longer-term, we expect the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our Microsoft Cloud services, And ongoing strategic investments to support our customers success. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with the last quarter, as we continue to invest to support growing demand.  Now to FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue at the total Company and all individual segment levels by approximately one point and have no impact on total COGS or operating expense growth. Next, to segment guidance, in Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.7 and $15.95 billion. In office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5.  In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the Cloud. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-teens with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and continued engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the mid 30% range and in dynamics we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. Driven by Strength and Dynamic 365 including continued momentum in Powerhouse For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.1 billion and $18.35 billion.  Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from  revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Q2 we expect healthy drive based growth in our Azure consumption business consistent with recent trends. And per user business, while continuing to benefit from Microsoft 365 sweet momentum should see a moderation in growth rates given the size of we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits driven by continued demand for hybrid solutions.  In enterprise services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits, In more personal computing, we expect revenue between $16.35 and $16.75 billion. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, OEM revenue should grow low to mid-teens including 6 points of impact $10 million dollar Window 11referal that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. In Windows commercial products cloud services customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive low double digit growth.  In Surface, we expect revenue to decline in single digits as we continue to work through supply chain uncertainty, particularly in our premium devices. In Search and News Advertising X Tech, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid 20s. If supply chain uncertainty reduces advertising budgets our results would be negatively impacted. And in gaming, on a high prior-year comparable, that included the launch of our new consoles and strength across Xbox content services, we expect revenue growth in a high single digits.  Console sales will continue to be strong engagement on the Xbox platform in a holiday quarter that will include several AAA title. Now back to Company guidance.  $17 to $17.2 billion and operating expense of $12.7 to $12.8 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. In closing, we are off to a strong start in FY '22 with tremendous opportunity to drive sustained, long-term revenue growth.  We remain focused on growing high value usage across our differentiated Microsoft Cloud offerings, and delivering exciting new consumer experiences with Windows 11, Surface and our Xbox gaming platform as we enter the holiday season. Our consistent approach to investing for these and other future opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid operating performance, will drive strong results throughout FY 22 and beyond. Now, Brett, let's go to Q&A.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants, please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely, If you would like to ask a question, . A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may  if you'd like to remove your question from the queue, for participants using a speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before . Our first question comes from Keith Weiss, with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on another remarkable quarter. Satya I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the edge computing opportunity, something that you started off your remarks with and also something that we're hearing a lot of chatter about within the investor community and within the technology community.  Can you talk to us about how you think about sizing that opportunity in terms of the programmable edge, and maybe help us understand the Microsoft architectural approach versus perhaps some of the competitors coming into the marketplace from the CDN perspective, who are talking about the competitive differentiation by having a more of them last mile solution. Can you help us understand the differentiation in those approaches?\nSatya Nadella: and a great question. Because we will always, as you know Keith, architected Azure for the distributed computing fabric to remain distributed. In other words, when we talked about hybrid computing even five years ago, the idea was always that, we will always have a Cloud and then we will have a distributed Cloud infrastructure for application deployment. So when we think about Cloud Plus Edge, we even put even the multi-cloud control playing in there, right?  So whether it is, what's happening with the 5G and how naturally compute will go to where data is getting generated with low latency access to a factory floor, to a hospital, to cities where you want to play XCloud gaming, that's one phenomena. The other is just literally treating every Cloud, whether it's the on-premise data center. It's the other public cloud, and our public cloud, and being able to use Azure Arc in its control plane to ease the deployment across all clouds.  That's another thing that we're seeing. So when I think about what is going to be key in such a distributed world is having that full suite of applications infrastructure, right? All the way from the management and security control plane, something like Azure Active Directory managing the security principles and Identities or and to the management control planes like Azure Arc and so we feel well-positioned for it. And I think that the multi-cloud, multi-edge world is really how we build Azure in the first place. And I think we're still very early in all of that playing out, but we feel well-positioned.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Keith. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies, please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Amy, commercial bookings up 14% is impressive, but its slowdown from last call was 25 against the more difficult comp. I think you had mentioned some color around Azure and the size and duration. Can you just maybe anything else you would call out there and realize -- realize it's come off a tough comps.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Yeah I think the important thing when you think about bookings performance is to talk about what happened before you got to those volatile, the large Azure commitments that create some of that top comparables that we're talking about. And that's really the opportunity to execute against selling the Microsoft  day to day, which is Dynamics, Microsoft Cloud, GitHub in the broader universe. Our execution on that was actually quite good. Very good renewals, very good recapture rates, very good add - ons, meaning you sell outside of the normal pattern, and so I feel very good.  It's very consistent execution to your point, Brent, this quarter versus others on that front. And then to your point, it's important not to time some of these larger long-dated Azure contracts. That's where the volatility is, the day-to-day execution of Azure commitments, actually was very consistent. The volatility comes with some of the bigger things and with a lot of them in Q4, last on a comparable basis in Q1 and that happens from time-to-time.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Brent. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Amy, heading into this Q1 release, I'd say there was a higher-than-normal level of worry. From investors about your Windows PC segments in light of all of the unit shipment and supply chain issues and yet, you put up a Windows OEM number that blew away your guidance and your guidance for the Windows OEM business in December was also I think way above what people are modeling. So I guess in essence, how did you dodge that bullet, Amy, maybe you could unpack that OEM performance for us. And your view into the second half of the fiscal year. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. I want to start by saying and repeating something that Tatia, I think was careful to include in his remarks. And it is the central nature of the PC to relay the nature of both hybrid work and fundamentally about getting jobs done. And I think the central role it's played we've talked about, I think, now for a number of quarters, and I think the reality of that continues to exist. I think the come more real for people as we talk about what hybrid is going to look like and continue to learn what hybrid is going to look like.  And to that end your PCs, the market grew this quarter, and it was constrained by supply. I believe Q2 will also be a strong demand quarter that is constrained by supply. But even with that, we see a growing market. And in particularly, in both Q1 and Q2, we see a strong demand in the commercial segment. I think that ties directly back to some of Satya 's comments about the central nature of the device. Then of course, we do get some benefit, Karl, because revenue per license is higher in commercial than it is in the broad market.  Those things together, which is a growing market, strong Windows performance within that market, in commercial in particular, And then, the resulting higher revenue per license results, and I think a very strong position in Q1 and Q2.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Congrats on that results, Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank your next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research, please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. And Satya, Amy, congratulations on the really strong quarter. With inflation, at least in the U.S., increasing and likely to further accelerate due to government spending, Amy, how do you think this increasing inflation will impact to your customers and your business? And Satya in your remarks, you discussed how digital is deflationary in inflationary world. Can you give more color on how the shift to Cloud and Digital will offset inflationary pressure beyond purely pricing. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Maybe I'll just start and then Amy, you can add to it. In an inflationary environment, the first place any business should go to is how to really ensure that they're able to get productivity gains. And even dealing with constraints, for example, if You have supply chain constraints, one of the things you want to do is run your factories at the efficient frontier, that means things like digital twins, simulation, are the ones where you are going to make sure that every production run has the least amount of wastage.  I think any which way you look, whether it's in the knowledge work, first-line work, whether it's actually digital twins and simulation, All of those things are going to be the best way for any Company to deal with inflationary pressures, so that they can, in fact, have the best productivity and that -- thereby the best ability to be able to meet aggregate demand out there.  That's why we're very, very excited about making sure our software products are available to our business customers all around to be able to manage through this inflationary environment and I'll let Amy add to that.\nAmy Hood: Yes, thanks, Satya and I think really  got to the heart mark of where I tend to go when you think about -- when you see the intensity of customers across industries and across geographies, wanting to adopt digital technology for many of the reasons Satya just explained. And there's numerous scenarios across, I think, most industries. That acceleration, of course, regardless, frankly, of the overall environment is a place where we feel like we offer the best portfolio at the Microsoft Cloud and with our Industry Clouds to make that doable with a very fast time to value.  And so our ability to execute against that regardless to the spend environment, means we've got the right portfolio and a high value to customers as deployable quickly that can get them results when they need that. And I think that's reflected in most of the surveys that really point to preference for  to help customers do that. So while -- of course, it's hard to predict what any quarter or second half will do. The things I believe to be sustainable are a push to digital -- a push to Cloud help customers get value quickly, and us being a trusted advisor and partner to help that happen.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. That's extremely helpful. I appreciate and congrats again.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Mark. Operator. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Great Quarter. You gave us great useful perspective on inflation. Curious if you can expand your thoughts, Satya and Amy, on the labor shortage, we're seeing in the tech market, how are you dealing with that? And also a little bit more of a deeper perspective on supply chain and how this marks have good visibility considering that you're growing your Cloud business and your CapEx commitments seem to be quite impressive. How much visibility do you have into component availability and you're ready to ramp up your CapEx. Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks Kash for the question. So on the labor market, maybe I'll start Amy, you can add to this. The first place where we're very, very focused on is to making sure that, with LinkedIn, we're doing everything to help everyone find their best economic opportunity and when Ryan Roslansky was the CEO of LinkedIn, talks about the great reshuffle. I think along with the hybrid work change, there is a real question everybody is asking. Not only where and how they work, but why they work.  And so to be able to make sure that we can help them find the opportunity that they are looking for is, I think, the most critical work that we can be doing. The second side to this, though, is also to per take the productivity of the people, whether they are on the front lines, and the first-line workers, or the knowledge workers, or even software developers, and making sure that they have the best tools, whether it's the GitHub harness and Visual Studio code for people who are developers or whether it is Power Apps or whether it is the Office 365, and then Microsoft 365 tooling to help them be most productive.  That's I think the thing that we're very, very focused on because key to dealing with labor shortages is productivity gains. And that Plus the work we're doing in LinkedIn is where we're focused on. So with that, Amy, I will hand it over to you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Satya. And Kash, as you probably noted I did talk about -- in this quarter, we did add, year-over-year, 14% headcount growth. And I think that's important, because when you talk about how, what, and why, we do remain focused on being a great employer, to have people achieve those goals and be able to achieve them here. Secondly, you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact, and specifically around data center, given our spend to this quarter, and my guidance is it should be similar next.  A lot of that cash is long lead time. So we have good understanding of lead times required to meet the capacity signals that we're seeing. I think we are doing good job managing that, it's not to say we're not impacted. Multiple suppliers are important to be able to manage through that, and I feel the team has done a very good job. In terms of specific impacts, I noted it, and some remarks, I do think demand will exceed supply in PCs and Surface for us.  This quarter, particularly in premium devices, in consoles for Xbox and another bit of -- another challenge I noted will just be -- we'll just need to watch the advertising market through the quarter, because obviously their willingness to spend is entirely connected to their supply as well.\nKash Rangan: Brilliant. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Could you speak a little bit to your -- in your remarks, you talked a lot more about the hybrid clouds and how certain tools that keep seeing a lot of benefits from that. What are you seeing on the client side about that dynamic in terms of people moving to the Cloud and kind of workloads migrating over there and hence sales less serve on towards versus actually kind of that being a net benefit for you. It seems like the pendulum is spinning in the other direction for you. Some help there would be helpful. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Maybe I can talk a bit to sort of what we are seeing, take the most, I would say, the classic model of lift shift in modernized motions, which is I think at the core of hybrid Cloud, that's still in -- still early innings. Every day I wake up to talk to customers who are planning out that motion and making sure that that able to modernize their entire application portfolio in various ways. So that's obviously still very, very strong. The interesting thing for us, even in that context, is even in the height of our success in declined server era, we really would never a Tier-1 Company that is not who we are.  In the sense that you take all the SAP workloads that are running on Azure, which I talked about, or other Tier-1 workloads that are migrating, whether it's HPC or transactional database workloads. So that's the other thing which is happening is real production workloads moving over. And then on the data estate, that's the place where perhaps we're seeing significant traction, and I referenced that in some of my remarks all the way from what's happening with, say, operational data stores like Cosmos DB, with Synapse linked to Synapse or Power BI to Synapse or in fact, Dynamics 365 data wars to Synapse.  There's tons and tons of coming together of the data estate, with for example, regulatory requirements now that you need to have real governance on data. That's where Azure Purview becomes, again, a pretty big driver of that data gravity to the Cloud from a governance perspective. The other side of this is what's happening with Dev Tools. When you start having your CI/CD to your Cloud, then modern new applications and the agility with which you bill. So with GitHub, VS code becoming essentially default for any modern dev shop in the enterprise or otherwise, that\u2019s he other thing that we see.  But perhaps more than anything else, the interesting circuit for us is what happens with Teams. With Teams, you suddenly now have a new platform in which applications get hosted, whether it's developed by the enterprise or by third-party. And I referenced that in my remarks, and those applications in many cases get built on our Cloud, use things like Azure DB, use things like Power Platform. and so the reinforcing and compounding side of Teams to Power Apps to Dynamics to Azure is probably one of the most unique things we're seeing in terms of new applications getting built.  And then the Cloud Plus Edge, which I referenced in the answer to the first question, which is in a multi-Cloud, multi edge world, you still need a control plane that manages all that complexity and that's where something like Azure Arc and GitHub become the two standards. You develop in one place, you deploy in one place, and then you propagate to every Cloud that you want to deploy in.\nAmy Hood: And Raimo, just maybe to add, you may have been asking also just about the nature of some of the comments I was making about on - prem server results. And it really points to hybrid strength. That's the way I tend to think about it and whether that's the fact that people are committed to Windows and SQL server and whether they run that in Azure or whether they run it in a multi-cloud environment it's a commitment to the platform and so I just wanted to make that, probably, more clear as one of the drivers of our Server products and Cloud KPI execution this quarter.\nRaimo Lenschow:  Thank you. Very clear. Congrats.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Raimo. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. So recently, several of your Tier-1 as size has talked about, having trouble hiring fast enough to keep up with demand and clearly your results speak to that. But as we look going forward, have you seen any early indications that customers are potentially having to slowed down the pace of with which they move to your commercial Cloud? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: I mean, I will point to Amy's guide for the next quarter as far as we are looking at is the demand across the entire stack is pretty robust and obviously what happens in the labor market, whether it's in the tech labor market or any other labor market, will ultimately be something that we would all be subject to. But the thing at least about the software businesses are in order to deal with a lot of other constraints, whether they are labor shortages or supply shortages, deploying digital tech is one way to really overcome them.  So that's what we see clearly, I think in the tech sector today there is more structural demand than perhaps supply all around. But we like that position because at some level we just want to make sure that we have the most competitive products out there, and as long as we continue to do so, I think we'll be fine.\nAmy Hood: Yeah, and I do think frankly, Brad, just the signals we're seeing on consumption and usage we'd say customers are doing a good job of figuring out the priority list that delivers value to them, as Satya is saying. I do know obviously, that the labor market has a real impact, and I think that's also why you're seeing investment being made by us in particular, into training and skilling, making deployment easier, making time-to-value faster, really having documentation that makes getting started and trials far more accessible.  And so when you talk about adding productivity it's also an investment we as Microsoft need to make, and to making our products easier and really terrific to get going on, so that you're not constrained in the way that you're talking about.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brad, Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sill: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Congratulations on a real nice quarter here. Satya, I wanted to ask about comments you made earlier in the call around investments coming and new releases coming for some of the industry Cloud, financial services, manufacturing. How do we -- how should we view this? Should we think of the Azure business results kind of driven increasingly by these Industry Cloud type solutions away from horizontal type projects like ERP database, that's obviously been there. But is this an incremental opportunity that's coming that we should be thinking about. Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you for the question. Absolutely, we think of the Microsoft Cloud, which includes Azure, it includes Dynamics 365, it includes Microsoft 365, it includes things like Power Platform, it includes even GitHub and VS Code. That's why we keep stressing the full modern tech stack that makes up Microsoft Cloud. And then with the Industry Cloud, we add value on top of that, which is specific, whether it's in retail, whether it's manufacturing, obviously in healthcare, and our pending Nuance acquisition really in add further to that.  Obviously, we're very focused on, first of all, not any just one piece, which we -- each one of those has to be competitive on their own, it's the coming together of the Microsoft Cloud and in the Industry Cloud, adds further value on top of it. So yes, I think ultimately our competitiveness comes because of all of those layers integrated and delivering that time-to-value for our customers while maintaining openness in each layer and competitiveness in each layer\nBrad Sill: That's great, thanks Satya.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

We had a solid close to our fiscal year. The Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 billion in annual revenue, up 27% in constant currency, with Azure all-up accounting for more than 50% of the total for the first time. Every customer I speak with is asking not only how, but how fast they can apply next-generation AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face, and to do so safely and responsibly. To that end, we remain focused on 3 key priorities: first, helping customers use the breadth and depth of Microsoft Cloud to get the most value on to their spend; second, investing to lead in the new AI platform shift by infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack; and third, driving operating leverage. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure continues to take share as customers migrate their existing workloads and invest in new ones. We continue to see more cloud migrations, as it remains early when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity. We are also seeing increasing momentum with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers, up 150% year-over-year, including Carnival Corp., Domino's, Thermo Fisher. And Azure AI is ushering in new born-in-the-cloud AI-first workloads, with the best selection of frontier and open models, including Meta's recent announcements supporting Llama on Azure and Windows, as well as OpenAI. We have great momentum across Azure OpenAI Service. More than 11,000 organizations across industries, including IKEA, Volvo Group, Zurich Insurance, as well as digital natives like Flipkart, Humane, Kahoot, Miro, Typeface, use the service. That's nearly 100 new customers added every day this quarter. Mercedes-Benz, for example, is bringing ChatGPT via Azure OpenAI to more than 900,000 vehicles in the United States, making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive. And Moody's built its own internal copilot to improve productivity of its 14,000 employees. We're also partnering broadly to scale this next generation of AI to more customers. Snowflake, for example, will increase its Azure spend as it builds new integrations with Azure OpenAI. And KPMG has announced a multibillion-dollar commitment to our cloud and AI services to transform professional services. Now on to data. Every AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our intelligent data platform brings together operational databases, analytics and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We introduced Microsoft Fabric this quarter, which unifies compute storage and governance with a disruptive business model. One month in, we are encouraged by early interest in usage. Over 8,000 customers have signed up to trial the service and are actively using it, and over 50% are using 4 or more workloads. All-up, we once again took share with our analytics solutions with customers like Bridgestone, Chevron and Equinor turning to our stack. Now on to developers. New Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy models, and do so responsibly. VS Code and GitHub Copilot are category-leading products when it comes to how developers code every day. Nearly 90% of GitHub Copilot sign-ups are self-service, indicating strong organic interest and pull-through. More than 27,000 organizations, up 2x quarter-over-quarter, have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business to increase the productivity of their developers, including Airbnb, Dell and Scandinavian Airlines. We're also applying AI across low-code, no-code tool chain to help domain experts automate workflows, create apps and web pages, build virtual agents, or analyze data using just natural language. Copilot in Power BI combines the power of large language models with an organization's data to generate insights faster, and Copilot in Power Pages makes it easier to create secure low-code business websites. One of our tools that's really taken off is Copilot in Power Virtual Agents, which is delivering one of the biggest benefits of this new area of AI, helping customer service agents be significantly more productive. HP and Virgin Money, for example, have both built custom chatbots with Copilot and Power Virtual Agents that were trained to answer complex customer inquiries. All-up, more than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 75% quarter-over-quarter. Finally, Power Automate now has 10 million monthly active users at companies like Jaguar Land Rover, Repsol, Rolls-Royce, up 55% year-over-year. And we're going further with new process mining capabilities in Power Automate, which are helping organizations optimize business processes and, in turn, build their AI advantage. Now on to business applications. We are taking share in every category as we help organizations across the private and public sector from Avis to Albertsons to Breville to Equinox and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs transform their mission-critical business processes. All-up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience, service and finance and supply chain businesses all surpassing $1 billion in annual sales. This quarter, we brought Dynamics 365 Copilots to our ERP portfolio, including finance, project operations and supply management. And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can ground their customer interactions with data from CRM systems, including both Salesforce and Dynamics to personalize customer interactions and close more deals. Now on to our industry and cross-industry clouds. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is helping customers like Costco, Land O'Lakes and REI take action to meet their environmental goals. And in health care, hundreds of organizations are using our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution to automatically document patient encounters at the point of care. This quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Epic to integrate Nuance DAX Express directly into their industry-leading EHR system. Now on to future of work. Across industries, customers like Ahold Delhaize, Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Siemens, Wells Fargo are choosing Microsoft 365 premium offerings for differentiated security, compliance, voice and analytics value. And 4 months ago, we introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot. We are now rolling out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 600 paid customers through our early access program, and feedback from organizations like Emirates NBD, General Motors, Goodyear and Lumen is that it's a game changer for employee productivity. We continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings and calling. We now have more than 1,900 apps in Teams app store. And companies in every industry, from British Airways, to Dentsu, to Eli Lilly and Manulife, have built over 145,000 custom line of business apps, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. Five months in, Teams Premium has already surpassed 600,000 seats as companies like BNY Mellon, Clifford Chance, PepsiCo and Starbucks chose the add-on for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling with more than 17 million PSTN users, up 45% year-over-year. Teams Room is used by more than 70% of the Fortune 500, including L'Oreal, United Airlines and U.S. Bank, and revenue more than doubled year-over-year this quarter. And with Microsoft Viva, we are creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva now has 35 million monthly active users as companies like CBRE, Fujitsu and Unisys turn to the platform to build data-driven, high-performance organizations. Now on to Windows. The number of devices running Windows 11 has more than doubled in the last year, and we are seeing continued growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments worldwide by companies like AT&T, Krones and Westpac. We are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed for enterprise customers with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months. Enbridge, Eurowings, Marriott International and TD Bank Group, for example, all chose cloud-delivered Windows this quarter. Windows 11 is also rapidly becoming a powerful new canvas in this new era of AI. We introduced Windows Copilot this quarter, helping every Windows 11 user become a power user with just natural language and are excited to put it in the hands of more people in the coming months. Now on to security. More than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estate across cloud and endpoint platforms, up 26% year-over-year. More than 60% including leading enterprises like ABN AMRO, Dow and Heineken use 4 or more of our security products, up 33% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. And we once again took share across all major categories we serve as we innovate to protect customers. In identity, Microsoft Entra ID has more than 610 million monthly active users, and we are adding SSE to our Entra product family to complement our leading identity solution and secure access to any app or resource from anywhere. Finally, our Security Copilot, the first product to apply this next generation of AI to SecOps will be available to customers via paid early access program this fall. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn's revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, and membership growth has now accelerated for 8 quarters in a row, a testament to how mission-critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell and get hired. Our Talent Solutions business surpassed $7 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months, and our hiring business took share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to use AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into experiences of experts on the platform. Our AI-powered collaborative articles are now the fastest-growing traffic driver in LinkedIn. And finally, we are helping LinkedIn stay trusted and authentic. More than 7 million members have verified who they are or where they work, many using new integrations with Microsoft Entra as well as CLEAR and Hyperverge. Now on to search, advertising and news. While it's early in our journey, we are reshaping daily search and web habits with our Copilot for the web. This quarter, we introduced new AI-powered features, including multimodal capabilities with visual search and Bing Chat. We are expanding to businesses with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of this next generation of AI today. Bing is also the default search experience for OpenAI's ChatGPT, bringing timelier answers with links to our reputable sources to ChatGPT users. To date, Bing users have engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images with Bing Image Creator, and Microsoft Edge took share for the ninth consecutive quarter. More broadly, we are growing our ad network, which is now available in 187 markets spanning search, display, native, retail, media, video and connected TV. Now on to gaming. Last week, we extended our Activision Blizzard merger agreement deadline to October. We continue to work through the regulatory approval process and remain confident about getting the deal done. We are committed to bringing more games to more players everywhere. Great content is key to our approach, and our pipeline has never been stronger. We announced our most ambitious lineup of games ever at our showcase last month, including 21 titles that will be available via Xbox Game Pass. And we're looking forward to the release of Starfield this fall, Bethesda's first new universe in 25 years. All-up, we set new fourth quarter highs for monthly active users, driven by strength off-console, as well as monthly active devices. And we saw record fourth quarter engagement across Game Pass, with hours played up 22% year-over-year. And just last week, we announced Game Pass Core, bringing together online play from Xbox Live and content from Game Pass into a single offering.  In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We continue to innovate across the tech stack to help our customers thrive in the new era of AI.  And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $56.2 billion, up 8% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.69 and increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, results exceeded expectations with focused execution by our sales and partner teams. These execution efforts led to share gains again this quarter in Azure, Dynamics, Security and Edge. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy renewal strength, which includes our upsell and attach motions, particularly with Microsoft 365 E5. Growth of new business continued to be moderated for products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite, including stand-alone Office 365, EMS and Windows Commercial products. As expected in Azure, we saw a continuation of the optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter. In our consumer business, the PC market overall was in line with expectations, although the early timing of back-to-school inventory builds benefited Windows OEM. Advertising spend was slightly lower than anticipated, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. Commercial bookings decreased 2% and 1% in constant currency, in line with expectations against the prior year comparable that was our largest commercial bookings quarter ever. In addition to the healthy execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier, we saw a record number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. And the average annualized value for our large, long-term Azure contracts was the highest it's ever been, driven by customer demand for our innovative cloud solutions today as well as interest in AI opportunities ahead. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 19% and 18% in constant currency to $224 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 13% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 22%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 1 point, 1 point favorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $30.3 billion and grew 21% and 23% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year to 72%, also slightly ahead of expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expense increased 2%, in line with expectations as savings across the company from our focus on prioritization and efficiency were offset by the charge related to the Irish Data Protection Commission matter. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was flat compared to a year ago. Operating income increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 4 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 2 points, driven by improved operating leverage through disciplined cost management. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.3 billion and grew 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results in Office Commercial, partially offset by LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, a bit better than expected with particular strength in E5 upsell renewal noted earlier. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office Commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency with better-than-expected transactional purchasing. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to $67 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions, with some continued bookings impact from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Growth was partially offset by a decline in Marketing Solutions due to the lower ad spend noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 26% and 28% in constant currency, with continued healthy growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased slightly and operating income increased 25% and 29% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24 billion, increasing 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 18% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 26% and 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services, as expected. In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 256 million seats, with impact from the continued growth trends in new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by a slight decrease in new annuity contracts, which carry higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise Services revenue grew 4% and 5% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 10%. Operating income grew 20% and 22% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.9 billion, decreasing 4% and 3% in constant currency, above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in Windows, partially offset by Gaming. Windows OEM revenue decreased 12% year-over-year, ahead of expectations due to 7 points of benefit from early back-to-school inventory builds, while the overall PC market was as expected. Devices revenue decreased 20% and 18% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, due to the renewal strength noted earlier, even with the moderated growth of new business and stand-alone offerings. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 8%, a bit behind expectations due to lower ad spend noted earlier. Higher search volumes, share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser, and the benefit from the Xandr acquisition were partially offset by the impact from third-party partnerships. And in Gaming, revenue increased 1% and 2% in constant currency, lower than expected due to weakness in first-party and third-party content performance. Xbox content and services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 13%. Segment gross margin dollars declined 2% and were relatively unchanged in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 9% and 8% in constant currency. Operating income increased 4% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $10.7 billion to support cloud demand, including investments in AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $8.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $28.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Free cash flow was $19.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 22% and free cash flow increased 19%. This quarter, other income and expense was $473 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to our shareholders to over $38 billion for the full fiscal year. Now let's turn to next fiscal year and start with a few reminders. First, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $3.7 billion of depreciation expense shifting from FY '23 to future periods. Our FY '23 operating income and margins benefited from this change in accounting estimate and that will be a headwind to growth in FY '24 as the benefit reduces to $2.1 billion. Next, my outlook commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. And my outlook does not include any impact from the Activision acquisition, which we continue to work towards closing, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Now for some thoughts on the full year of FY '24. With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. The impact in H1 is expected to be greater than H2. At a total company level, revenue growth from our Commercial business will continue to be driven by the Microsoft Cloud and will again outpace the growth from our Consumer business. Even with strong demand and a leadership position, growth from our AI services will be gradual as Azure AI scales and our copilots reach general availability dates. So for FY '24, the impact will be weighted towards H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially each quarter through the year as we scale to meet demand signals. We are committed to driving operating leverage, and therefore, we will manage our total cost growth across COGS and operating expense in line with the demand signals we see as well as revenue growth. Increased capital spend will drive higher COGS growth than in FY '23, and FY '24 operating expense growth will remain low as we prioritize our spend. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year, even with the headwind from the change in accounting estimate. And finally, we expect our FY '24 tax rate to be around 19%. Now to the outlook for the first quarter. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to COGS growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth in Intelligent Cloud by 1 point with no impact to Productivity and Business Processes or More Personal Computing. In Commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including our renewal and upsell motions, along with long-term measure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change headwind noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q1 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvements in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, as noted earlier, driven by investments in our AI infrastructure. Reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% or USD 18 billion to USD 18.3 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. Even with share gains in our hiring business, growth will continue to be impacted by the overall markets for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16%, or 14% and 15% in constant currency. Revenue should be USD 23.3 billion to USD 23.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 25% to 26% in constant currency, including roughly 2 points from all Azure AI Services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q4 to continue into Q1. Our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits against a prior comparable that benefited from annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be more than offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 12.5 billion to USD 12.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-teens, including 5 points of negative impact from the earlier back-to-school inventory builds that were pulled into the fourth quarter. Our guide assumes no significant changes to the PC demand environment. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-30s due to the overall PC market and adjustments we made in our portfolio with an increased focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be mid- to high single digits, roughly 5 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains. Growth will continue to be impacted by the advertising spend environment and third-party partnerships mentioned earlier. We continue to be excited by Bing usage signals and the longer-term opportunity as we invest in AI. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, driven by first-party and third-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 16.6 billion to USD 16.8 billion and operating expense of USD 13.5 billion to USD 13.6 billion. Together, total cost growth should be around 6%. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Two reminders. This does not include any impact from Activision on interest income and expense, and we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be around 19%. And finally, as a reminder for Q1 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.7 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA transition tax. We do not expect payment related to the R&D capitalization provision in Q1. In closing, as a company, we delivered on the FY '23 financial commitments we discussed a year ago on revenue and operating margin. A focus on operational excellence allowed us to achieve these targets while we delivered near-term value to customers and prioritized our investments to continue to lead in the future. As we start FY '24, we are excited for the opportunities ahead and remain focused on delivering the 3 key priorities Satya mentioned. We'll maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud by helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud. We'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure while scaling with growing demand so we can lead the AI platform wave. And finally, we'll align our costs with growth as we are committed to driving operating leverage.  With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Joe, can you please repeat your instruction?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: A very nice end to a great fiscal year. Satya, you started your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What's the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers can start using it? And then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there's going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these. But what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for the question. The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value out of generative AI is to adopt certain solutions, for example, GitHub Copilot. In some sense, it's sort of a no-brainer to add productivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization. Whether you're a bank, you're a retailer or you're a software company, it applies to everyone. So that's probably one of the things that we have seen very good -- even productivity data and great adoption. And then obviously, the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot. So first thing we sort of talk about is how we ourselves are deploying all these Copilots across, whether it's Sales Copilot or M365 Copilot or GitHub Copilot, how do you get maximum value out of these horizontal tool chain? And then on top of that, we have taken what we did underneath these products and built it out as a first-class tech stack, right, which we talked at our developer conference, called the Copilot Stack, and then with Azure AI tooling, made it possible for a someone like Moody's to build their own Copilot for their people. So to us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI, and with speed, if you will. And so those are the 2 things that we ask them to identify where they can get the maximum productivity leverage. And then we even swung with our own resources to help them get those things done. And the last comment I'd make is the cloud and data in the cloud enables all this because I think the diffusion cycle here, in some sense, we have a new set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. So those would be the observations.\nAmy Hood: And to your question, Keith, on gross margins and how I think about those going forward, the first thing I would say is that I expect gross margins here to transition over time, just like they did in the prior cloud transitions. I would also say I expect workloads and the gross margins of the workloads to be different, just like they are in the cloud today. I would also add one thing that's different than last time, we talked a bit about this before, is that we start out in a different place with more of a shared platform, which allows us to scale those gross margins a bit faster than last time. And we do expect, as you asked and Satya talked about, the pace of this adoption curve, we do expect to be faster. So you're seeing the CapEx spend accelerate in Q4 and then again in Q1, and we've talked about what it should look like the rest of the year. Now that being said, we're talking about all that and going through that transition while delivering in FY '24 over FY '23, effectively 1 point higher operating margins. Because if it's flat year-over-year, as we guided, with the headwind from the useful life change, when you correct for that, it's about 1 point higher. So I think the real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve and focusing on the transition and growth in gross margins and delivering the operating leverage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Satya, on the optimization headwinds that you continue to see, when do you think we hit peak optimization? Are we getting close to hitting that peak and getting some relief in the back half of the year and maybe AI helping provide us a tailwind? Any color from what you're seeing from your perspective would be helpful.\nSatya Nadella: Sure, Brent. Thank you for the question. Yes, a couple of observations. One is, I think, overall in the cloud, you do see new project starts and then those project starts get optimized and then you sort of time-series all of that, and that's sort of what you see in the normal course. What happened here was during the pandemic, obviously, there were lots of new project starts and optimization in some sense was postponed, and that's where you're seeing, I'll call it, catch-up optimization. And that's something that, to your point, we will lap. Going into the next couple of quarters, I think, it will come down. And we are seeing new project starts, both traditional type of project starts, even cloud migrations, data applications and, of course, obviously, the AI applications. But we'll get back to I'll call the normal pace of new project starts and optimizations going forward, that we will cycle through, I think, in the next couple of quarters, what is the last catch-up optimization.\nAmy Hood: I would just add, Brent, I think to Satya's point and maybe to build a bit of a line for you, I think it felt very similar to last quarter where we made the same comments, which is we're seeing sort of the normal optimization plus we're seeing new workload starts across these workloads Satya talked about. And I think that's what we're saying going forward and really what the change is just that lapping of, I think, a bit of a catch-up from a year ago. And you're right, we'll continue to do that through H2.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: And congrats on the quarter. Amy, CapEx moved up significantly Q-over-Q and year-over-year and it's increasing moving forward. Can you give us some color? Is it physical data centers? Is it predominantly servers? Is it predominantly AI-driven? How should we think about the useful life of it? And then quickly for Satya, can you give us some -- status on the general availability of the full Copilot development stack? And how long it's taking clients and partners to build Copilots?\nAmy Hood: Why don't I start on the CapEx question, Satya, then I'll turn it over to you. Mark, really, first of all, both in Q4 and then talking about Q1, the acceleration is really quite broad. It's both on -- both the data centers and a physical basis plus CPUs and GPUs and networking equipment, think of it in a broad sense as opposed to a narrow sense. So it's overall increases of acceleration of overall capacity. And I think if you look back over really FY '23, you wouldn't have seen some of the pace on normal, what I would say, capacity adds, even for the normal Azure workload. So you're seeing both accelerations, the normal Azure workloads plus some of the AI workloads, is partially the reason. So it's why I do comment quite often that it's both overall Commercial Cloud demand and building out capacity for AI. It's both.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. And I think just for perspective, I think it's sort of always good to think about it, right, where we have, what, 111 [bill] (ph) commercial cloud business growing at, what, 22% year-over-year. And then you had a CapEx growth, which is around the same number, 23%, 24%. So in some sense, it's sort of replacement capital plus some new capital that is going to drive new growth. So that's, I think, the scale. And we feel good about that structure of overall growth rates and how it translates into future TAM opportunity for us. And then to your other question on how all this translates into project starts effectively, the Copilot stack is available today on Azure. So we have everything from Azure AI tool chain where you can use obviously, Azure OpenAI or even you can use open models from Llama and Hugging Face models. You have all the Fabric and all of our operational data stores for what is one of the most useful patterns around generative AI as what is called Retrieval Augmented Generation, which is you take the data that you have in the data stores, use it in a prompt to generate completions, summaries, what have you. And so that's something that we've seen a lot of and the Copilots are fundamentally orchestrations of that. And so we have all of these services available. The thing that's fascinating is when you use something like Power Virtual Agent, you have a low-code, no-code tool to build effectively these AI products or full-fledged Copilots like we've built. And all the underlying primitives for that are available on Azure. The tool chain is available on Azure and the speed with which customers are able to deploy them, ISVs are able to build them, is pretty impressive.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: Congratulations on the quarter. If I could, I just wanted to get your thoughts to shift the discussion away from COGS and the CapEx to more of the top line outlook. It looks like Azure growth rate is definitely starting to stabilize and generative AI contribution to Azure is measurably improving quarter-over-quarter, and optimization in a broader sense is also starting to settle down. Where does this leave with the company's outlook for Azure growth rate in the future quarters? Are we at a point where we've bottomed out, and we could start to see some acceleration due to the trends we discussed? And also if we take the superset of Microsoft Cloud, when you throw in the new pricing for Copilot, it certainly looks like the TAMs are opening up in a pretty significant way. So when you take the broader lens, that 21%, 22% growth rate that Satya and Amy referred to, what could be the outlook? Could we be too optimistic in entertaining hopes of some kind of acceleration in the years ahead? Or how do you think about the outlook on the top line?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Kash, thanks for the question. So maybe I'll start and then, Amy, you can add because I think -- we do think about what's the long-term TAM here, right? I mean this is -- you've heard me talk about this as a percentage of GDP, what's going to be tech spend? If you believe that, let's say, the 5% of GDP is going to go to 10% of GDP, maybe that gets accelerated because of the AI wave. Then the question is how much of that goes to the various parts of our Commercial Cloud and then how competitive are we in each layer, right? So if you sort of break it down, you sort of talked about how Microsoft 365, we think of this Copilot as a third pillar, right? We had the creation tools. We then had all the communication and collaboration services, and we think the AI Copilot is a third pillar. So we are excited about it. Amy talked about how we want to get it out first and part of this preview. And then in the second half of the next fiscal year, we'll start getting some of the real revenue signal from it. So we're looking forward to it. But we think of it long term as a third pillar, like we thought about something like, say, Teams or SharePoint back in the day, or what have you. Then Azure, the way I think about it is we still are, whatever, you're inning 2 or inning 3 of even the cloud migration, especially if you view it, right, whether by industry moves to the cloud, segment move to the cloud as well as country adoption of the cloud, right? So there's still early innings of the cloud migration itself. So there's a lot there still. And then on top of that, there's this complete new world of AI driving a set of new workloads. And so we think of that, again, being pretty expansive from a TAM opportunity and we'll play it out. But at the same time, we are a $111 billion commercial cloud that has grown in 20s, and so therefore, we do hit law of large numbers. But that said, we do think that this is a business that can have sustained high growth, which is something that we are excited about.\nAmy Hood: And I think the only thing, Kash, I would add is, I think in some ways, what we're really pointing to is there's a process here. We see the demand signal is quite strong. It remains strong. I'm thrilled with all the product announcements we've made. I'm thrilled with them moving to paid preview and then moving to GA. They absolutely are expansive in terms of addressable market. They reach new budget pools is almost the way I talk about it a lot in terms of how CIOs or CFOs that I talk to think about that investment. So a growing opportunity. And as you know, we're focused on executing against that. And then revenue is an outcome. But it certainly does require -- the demand signal requires the capital expense and then creates the opportunity. And that's why I think, in some ways, we're spending a little more time talking about some of that investment is because it is the demand signal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Amy, if I could double-click a little bit on the exciting news around M365 Copilot as everybody on the line looks to layer that opportunity into our models, I just wanted to get your views. Are there any guardrails you'd offer us to sort of keep us in line? Is there a degree of gross margin pressure in the Office segment? In other words, is it a fairly cost-intensive new product that we should keep in mind? And also, could it pull along Azure in the sense that you need Azure AD and perhaps some of the other cybersecurity products? So a little color there might help everybody with their modeling exercise tonight and in the coming weeks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. I think maybe I'll first start with the process we have when we release new products. And I absolutely understand we are excited, too, by the demand signal, the customer reaction, really the requests we're getting to be in the paid preview. It's all encouraging. As you know, we've -- last week, we announced pricing, then we'll continue to work through the paid preview process get good feedback. Then we'll announce the general availability date, then we'll get to the GA date. Then we'll, of course, be able to sell it and then recognize revenue. And that is why I continue to say that I am just as excited as everyone else about this, and it should be more H2 weighted. And we've, I think, given you some sizing opportunities. And I think I would use all that. But I do think this is really about pacing. And of course, we've still got to get our Security Copilot and some of the Dynamics workloads priced and released. And we'll continue to work toward that. And of course, I think one of the things that people often, I think, overlook is, and Satya mentioned it briefly when you go back to the pull on Azure, I think in many ways, lots of these AI products pull along Azure because it's not just the AI solution services that you need to build an app. And so it's less about Microsoft 365 pulling it along or any one Copilot. It's that when you're building these, it requires data and it requires the AI services. So you'll see them pull both core Azure and AI Azure along with them. And I think that's an important nuance as well.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. If I could just add to what Amy said, the platform effect here is really all about the extensibility of the Copilots. You see that today when people build applications in Teams that are built on Power Apps and those Power Apps happen to use something like SQL DB on Azure. That's like a classic line of business extension. So you'll see the same thing. When I have a Copilot plug-in, that plug-in uses Azure AI, Azure meters, Azure data sources, Azure semantic search. So you'll see, obviously, a pull through not only on the identity or security layer, but in the core PaaS services of Azure plus the Copilot extensibility in M365.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Satya, there's so much evidence now that GitHub Copilot is boosting developer productivity by 40% to 50% or more, and it's resulting in higher quality code. Do you envision a similar level of productivity boost for the Microsoft 365 Copilots or the Security Copilot or the Sales Copilot? In other words, can every room in the house be remodeled to a similar extent such that, that value proposition is pretty elevated across the entire stack?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Judson Althoff would love you for having used his metaphor of remodeling every room of the house with AI because you're absolutely right. I mean that's the opportunity we see. I think what you're also referencing is now there's good empirical evidence and data around the GitHub Copilot and the productivity stats around it. And we're actively working on that for M365 Copilot, also for things like the role-based ones like Sales Copilot or Service Copilot. We see these business processes having very high productivity gains. And so yes, over the course of the year, we will have all of that evidence. And I think at the end of the day, as Amy referenced, every CFO and CIO is also going to take a look at this. I do think for the first time -- or rather, I do think people are going to look at how can they complement their OpEx spend with essentially these Copilots in order to drive more efficiency and, quite frankly, even reduce the burden and drudgery of work on their OpEx and their people and so on. So therefore, I think you're going to see all of that translated into productivity stats, and we're looking forward to getting that data out.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: I guess maybe just a multi-parter. You mentioned a couple of times that with the AI workload adoption that you're seeing on Azure, it's starting to look maybe a little bit different from an incremental share gain perspective versus previous generations. Can you maybe expand upon that? How should that drive for Azure consumption, particularly as we get through the year? And do you see a scenario where either the combination of lapping the optimization headwind, plus the AI contribution, plus this incremental tailwind that you're seeing around the workloads actually does drive a reacceleration in Azure, particularly in the second half when you're going to start to see some of those things kick in?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I mean the thing that we are both seeing and excited about is both the new workloads. I mean if you think about Azure, we have grown Azure over the years coming from behind. And here we are as a strong #2 in the lead when it comes to these new workloads. So for example, we are seeing new logos, customers who may have used out of the cloud for most of what they do, or for the first time, sort of starting to use Azure for some of their new AI workloads. We also have even customers who've used multiple clouds who use that for a class of sort of workloads also start new projects when it's transferred in data and AI, which they were using other clouds. So what I think you will see us is more share gains, more logo gains, reducing our CAC even. And so those are the things of points of leverage. But at the same time, we are not a small business anymore in any of these things. We're significantly -- we have significant scale. And so, yes, we celebrate. That's why we're even giving you the visibility at 1 point of it showing up this quarter, a couple of points showing up next quarter. And those are material numbers. And so that's kind of what I think will track. And I think Amy mentioned it because we want -- there are 2 parts to even AI, right? There's the models themselves with our partnership with OpenAI. That's sort of one type of spend on compute. And the other is much more revenue-driven, right, which is we will track the inference cost to the revenue and demand. And you're already seeing both of those play out.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Satya, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your comments on data platforms. I think we've heard a lot over the last quarter or so about if you don't have a data strategy, it's tough to have an AI strategy. Can you just talk about where customers are right now in that journey to have a more, I guess, thoughtful data strategy? And what does that mean in terms of their ability to adopt AI services? Meaning do they have to sort of tackle the data issue first before they can really take advantage of all the AI services? Or how should we think about that sort of juxtaposition?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. Yes, absolutely. I think having your data, in particular, in the cloud is sort of key to how you can take advantage of essentially these new AI reasoning engines to complement, I'll call it, your databases because these AI engines are not databases, but they can reason over your data and to help you then get more insights, more completions, more predictions, more summaries, and what have you. So those are the things when we say Copilot design pattern, that's sort of what that design pattern is all about. The thing that perhaps even in the last quarter, and I had that in my remarks, that's most exciting is how with Microsoft Fabric, especially for the analytics workloads, we brought together compute, storage, governance with a very disruptive business model. I mean to give you a flavor for it, right, so you have your data in an Azure data lake. You can bring SQL Compute to it. You can bring Spark to it. You can bring Azure AI or Azure OpenAI to it, right? So the fact is you have storage separated from all these compute meters, and they're all interchangeable, right? So you don't have to buy each of these separately. That's the disruptive business model. So I feel that we are well -- Microsoft is very well positioned with the way our data architecture lays out our business model around data and how people will plan to use data with AI services. So that's kind of what I mean by getting your data estate in order. And it's just not getting data estate in order but you have to have it structured such that you can have the flexibility that allows you to exercise the data and compute in combinations that makes sense for this new age.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kirk. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, all.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you very much, Brett. The Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack. We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it\u2019s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models. More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks. Now on to data. Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world's most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance. The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks & Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight. Now on to developers. From Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud, all while staying in their flow. Today, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship and maintain software. And with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we are fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer from novices to experts. In three months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers. We're also bringing next-generation AI to Power Platform so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents and analyze data using only natural language. More than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform. And with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we are extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks. All up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year. Now on to business applications. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve as organizations like Asahi, C.H. Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton, choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate and predict every business process and function. And we are going further with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation and notetaking. Now on to our industry and cross-industry solutions. Our Cloud for Sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan and TCL as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week as we expanded our offerings for payors and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers. We showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical. And at Hannover Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows. Now on to future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work. Copilot works alongside users embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context. We've been encouraged by early feedback and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months. Teams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter, and we once again took share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN AMRO, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys and Vodafone. We announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to 2 times faster performance while using 50% less memory so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot. Teams is also expanding our TAM. Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms or Premium. Teams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce cost with a three year ROI of over 140%. Teams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year and Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps. Now generally available, it's one of our fastest-growing Modern Work products ever with thousands of paid customers just two months in. With Microsoft Viva, we have created a completely new suite for employee experience. Viva brings together goals, communications, learning, workplace analytics and employee feedback. Across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive. Just last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. And with Viva Sales, we have extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data so that they can automatically generate content like customer mails. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365, Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to Windows. While the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices and higher usage compared to pre-pandemic. We're also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments. Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11. And with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how our employees at companies like Mazda and Nationwide access Windows. All up, over one-third of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to-date. And new Windows 365 Frontline extends the power and security of Cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time. Now on to security. Our comprehensive AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders. Among analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider. And we once again took share across all major categories we serve and we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers. With Security Copilot, we are combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity. And we also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities along with resources they access. Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year. And all up, nearly 600,000 customers now have four or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. EY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection and visibility across their organizations. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell and get hired. Member growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter as we expanded to new audiences. We now have 100 million members in India, up 19%. And as Gen Z enters the workforce, we saw 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign-ups. In this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity. Our hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter. The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function from marketing, sales and finance to software development and security. LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss and up-level their skills with more than 100 AI courses. And we have introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions and collaborative articles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform. More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. Our exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated premium video content to our ad network, and our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits. Two months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we are very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns. All up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users. We are winning new customers on Windows and mobile. Daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown 4 times since launch. We are making progress in share gains. Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter and Bing once again grew share in the United States. We continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts powered by DALL-E. Over 200 million images have been created to date and we see that when people use these new AI features their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up. As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search. Now on to gaming. We are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, however and wherever they want. We set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices. Across our content & services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love. Our revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter. This quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we are available. Great content remains the flywheel behind our growth. We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first-party titles. And I\u2019ve never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall. In closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI. In a few weeks times, we'll hold our Build conference, and we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in. I could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency. Our results exceeded expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales teams and partners. In our commercial business, revenue was up 19% in constant currency. We saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365, which also benefited Windows Commercial given the higher in-period revenue recognition. In Office 365 stand-alone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows Commercial standalone products remained consistent with Q2. In Azure, customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected. In our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated, which negatively impacted results. Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations. We have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next-generation AI capabilities. Commercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 34%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations driven by cloud engineering efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by lower Azure margin. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue. Operating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office commercial. Office commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Office consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 25% and 29% in constant currency, with healthy growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expenses increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $22.1 billion, increasing 16% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency. In our per user business, enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, offset by transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and Devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations. We saw better-than-expected PC demand, as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition. Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S. And in Gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply. Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content and growth in Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provisions and employee payments primarily related to headcount growth and an increase in employee compensation. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%. This quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for the next quarter and FY '24 does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing. Overall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue through Q4. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions, including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth. Last year, we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large multiyear commitments. On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitment to our platform as we focus on meeting customers' changing contract needs, which include shorter term, quick time to value contracts in this dynamic environment. Our key focus remains on delivering customer value. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis, driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 billion to $18.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 billion to $23.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4, as noted earlier. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $13.35 billion to $13.75 billion. PC demand should be similar to Q3, and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize. Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s. In Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue is similar to Q3. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect Xbox content services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or $16.8 billion to $17 billion and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or $15.1 billion to $15.2 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. With our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. As with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation. And we are excited about the early feedback and demand signals for the AI capabilities we have announced to date. We will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend as we scale with the growing demand, driven by customer transformation. And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time. As always, we remain committed to aligning cost and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability. Therefore, while the scaled CapEx investments will impact COGS growth, we expect FY '24 operating expense growth to remain low. As a team, we have continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers. That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of decades. Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it. With that, let's go to Q&A. Brett?\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others in the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on really a fantastic set of results in what we all know to be a still difficult environment out there. I think it really illustrates Microsoft's advantages and a lot of these technology innovations that you guys have been talking about. I wanted to ask you a question that I get probably more often than anything else and one that I frankly don't have a good answer to, and that's around the OpenAI partnership and particularly the accounting for that partnership. So I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color about how -- whether or not revenue is flowing from OpenAI into Microsoft on the CapEx side of the equation, whether there's any impact. Just give us a better understanding of how the comping around that relationship is working.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Keith. In some ways, let me start by saying, it's a great partnership. We're proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you've heard us make more recently. And we talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits. When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us. But specifically to your question on how does it show up, it's easiest in this situation, to think about them as a customer of ours like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI services in service of supporting their end customers. And so when they do that, like any other customer who has a commercial relationship with us, we recognize revenue on that behalf. That's probably the simplest frame, Keith, that I hope is helpful.\nKeith Weiss: Yeah. That\u2019s super helpful. I appreciate that.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance and thanks for taking my question. I'd like to drill into Azure and more specifically, Azure IaaS/PaaS consumption. IaaS/PaaS consumption has really stepped down recently, and it's important to understand the macro versus macro and optimization that will rebound, whether it's going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue? In other words, is it simply purely macro and everyone is stepping back a little bit and they're going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that, that slowdown could sustain even when the IT spending rebounds. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Mark for the question. Maybe I'll make three comments. And it's also important, I think to distinguish between what I'd say, macro or absolute performance and relative performance because I think that's perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business. First is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization because we believe in the long run that the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workload. That's sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we are taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time. The second thing I'd say is, we do have new workloads started because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads. But pre pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads. So what we're seeing now is the new workloads start in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have. The third is perhaps more of a relative statement because of some of the work we've done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations we never had, whether it's coming through you and just OpenAI's API, right? If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to open AI and are using their API. These were not customers of Azure at all. Second, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new, and the workload conversations, whether it's B2C conversations in financial services or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are. So those are the three comments that I'd make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think, what is our relative market position and how it's being changed.\nAmy Hood: Mark, maybe the one thing I would add to those comments is, we've been through almost a year where that pivot that Satya talked about from we're starting tons of new workloads, and we'll call that the pandemic time, to this transition post, and we're coming to really the anniversary of that starting. And so to talk to your point, we're continuing to set optimization. But at some point, workloads just can't be optimized much further. And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps year-over-year. And so you even see that in a little bit of our guidance, some of that impact from a year-over-year basis.\nMark Moerdler: That was incredibly helpful. I really do appreciate. Thank you for the color and again, congratulations on what's happening.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Mark.\nBrett Iversen: Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed\nBrent Thill: Thanks. On Copilot monetization, can you just give us a sense of how much shows up, where we're going to see it? And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through Copilot, say, 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the Suite or is it too hard to factor in? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of meters across all of the tech stack, whether they're consumption meters or per user subscriptions. The Copilot that's priced and it is there is GitHub Copilot. That's a good example of incrementally how we monetize the prices that are there out there and others are to be priced because they're in preview mode. But you can expect us to do what we've done with GitHub Copilot pretty much across the board.\nAmy Hood: Yeah, Brent. The best way of thinking about this is when we believe we\u2019re adding a lot of value. And frankly, that\u2019s what the Copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have this price for those and you\u2019ll be able to look at that as we get to release, and to Satya\u2019s point, GitHub Copilot is a great example.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nBrett Iversen: Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact on Azure. Can you just, Satya, can you maybe a little - talk a little bit about like how you see the cost of compute for AI workloads versus kind of the classic workloads and how do you think that will evolve over time? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, a couple of them. One is clearly the accelerated compute is what gets used to drive AI. And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get it very efficient in the usage of those resources. If you think about sort of what the hyperscaler does, it's not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload and, in fact, heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware. And so we have many knobs that we\u2019ll continuously continue to drive optimization across it. And you see it even in the -- even for a given generation of a large model, where we started them to the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint even in a period of a quarter changes. So you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus with the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads. The other thing I'd mention is that there are a lot of workloads now. Like one of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said, this type of workload, whether it's a training or an inference workload is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of AI. And so you can see us apply it in other context as well.\nAmy Hood: And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts. And I think one of the important things to keep in mind, which Satya is pointing to is that it's not really just the cost of Azure and the ability to optimize across the Azure workloads. It's that really even our first-party workloads and apps that are built, right, are built on the same platform, and we're able because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first-party as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we're able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, AI services utilization across the stack. And so it's not just sort of where Satya wanted to see even a broader benefit of being a hyperscaler.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceed\nKeith Bachman: Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I want to address this up to you, if I could. On your prepared remarks, you commented that you thought that operating expense growth would be lower. I was hoping to just maybe flesh that out with some broader comments. Could you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix and particularly supporting generative AI and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Keith. It's probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is -- if you look at all of the businesses we're in and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is before Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute. And I'll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains. Right now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that something you're talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that while we continue to focus on our customers' success in getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that's the E5 product, the Microsoft 365, whether that's Windows 365 to help, maybe it's on compute costs and PC cost, whether it's working across the Azure stack. And so with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we've had in Windows, are still being used more being able to focus on edge share and being share and gaming -- bringing it to the PC as well across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on as we think about next year. And so if we feel like and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say, great, and we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about, will increase COGS growth, but we're committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low. And so what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. So while I know that's not giving specificity, it is, in fact, how we think about long-term success, in being well positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we're going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the build-out. We will charge for those AI capabilities and then ultimately will deliver operating profit.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think as shareholders, you may want to look at is what's the opportunity set ahead. We have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have. Both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack. And so therefore, that's the sort of approach we're going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all as shareholders long term. That's sort of where we look at it. And we'll manage the P&L carefully driving operating leverage in a disciplined way but not being shy of investing where we need to invest in order to grab the long-term opportunity. And so obviously, we will see share gains first, usage first, then GM, then OPInc, right, like a classic P&L flow. But we feel good about our position.\nKeith Bachman: All right. Many thanks for the answer.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks. We've had a lot of questions on AI and Azure, so maybe just to round it out. Just on the Office 365 business, Amy. 16% constant currency guide for June, not really seeing much seat degradation despite obviously a tight labor market, so it's proven to be very resilient. Could you just unpack the sensitivity to that headcount reduction, given that across your customer base, at least slower rate of hiring, just given that this is an enormous seat-based business? It doesn't seem to be showing up. Maybe you could just help us understand what's driving that continued seat growth and how durable that is?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. I think I would step back and say we have seen, I mean, the Office 365 suite but broadly, the Microsoft 365 suite adds a ton of value for users. And so if you think about the users and on the global base, we've been able to add users, which you continue to see. We still have in the frontline scenario at an SMB opportunity to continue to grow. And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in most places, and we continue to see customers committed to the value they're getting. And so I -- this is not something that -- I think our focus has really been on continuing to get healthy renewals, continue to add new products at renewal where it makes sense to save customers money and increase value. And so I think that's the story of the resilience you're seeing. And of course, we did have a good E5 quarter, which you're starting to see and it helps on ARPU.\nBrett Iversen: Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed\nRishi Jaluria: Hi, Satya. Hi, Ami. Thanks so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued resilience in the business. I wanted to get back to the topic of AI but I think maybe a little bit longer term. What -- how are you thinking about the potential for regulation around AI, some of the concerns around data and customer privacy and governance? And what do you think you can do to maybe quell some of those fears that governments and customers and organizations have around that? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. Thanks, Rishi for the question. So overall, we've taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that from day 1, we think, about as first class and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. So for example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles, we translated the AR principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process that then we hold ourselves to internal audit essentially. So that's the framework we have. We have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process. And so we feel very, very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. And so we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction. But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in AI, I think we stand to gain from that.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Rishi. Joe, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And our last question will come from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed\nMichael Turrin: Hey. Great. Thanks. Appreciate you squeezing me in. I want to ask a question on the consolidation play that Microsoft is positioning for giving. That's something we hear clearly top of mind for IT decision-makers currently. You have clear plays there across security infrastructure apps and other areas. So it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, and if there are certain areas you're particularly focused on or seeing more traction around. Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. I mean, I'll start and Amy, you can add. I think Amy referenced to even in the context of Microsoft 365 and Office 365. But fundamentally, what we are focused on is making sure that the customers are able to derive the value out of our offerings, right, whether it's the Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it's E3 or E5. And we want to make sure that our -- they're getting deployed, they're getting used and that's obviously going to lead to our share gains in many cases. Same thing in security. That's a place where this quarter, you saw some good results from us. And same on up and down the stack across Azure, right? So when you think about AI, the anatomy of an AI application is not just an AI model. In fact, ChatGPT itself is a great example. ChatGPT, for example, uses Cosmos DB as their core database. And so therefore, we want to make sure that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it's the IaaS layer, the PaaS layer or the SaaS layer.\nAmy Hood: And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that's going to get done, whether that's the Dynamics workload that we've talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI services available on Azure, from having the core Azure capabilities as well as actually some front-end stuff that people are buying in Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way. And so I think maybe it's not the traditional definition of consolidation. But when people look and say, what vendor adds a lot of value and has the tools that we need and, in many instances, already own to be able to do this business process work, I think we have a great value and, frankly, probably leading tools in almost every vertical.\nMichael Turrin: Great. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thank you, Michael. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you, all.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrett Iversen: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today\u2019s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company\u2019s second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\u2019s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I will turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you very much, Brett. I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear. Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend. Also, organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And the next major wave of computing is being born as we turn the world\u2019s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform. In this environment, we remain convicted on three things. This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers, helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long-term loyalty and share position while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This in turn sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase. And lastly, we are going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now, I will highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today\u2019s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we are still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity. As an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20% by migrating to Azure and reduced IT provisioning time from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust and PayPal. Now on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently while meeting regulatory requirements and ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers. Now on to AI. The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing non-linear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It\u2019s being used by customers and partners like OpenAI to train state-of-the-art models and services, including ChatGPT. Just last week, we made our Azure OpenAI service broadly available and already over 200 customers from KPMG to Al Jazeera are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time. And yesterday, we announced the completion of the next phase of our agreement with OpenAI. We are pleased to be their exclusive cloud provider and we will deploy their models across our consumer and enterprise products as we continue to push the state-of-the-art in AI. All of this innovation is driving growth across our Azure AI services. Azure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100% for five quarters in a row with companies like AXA, FedEx and H&R Block choosing the service to deploy, manage and govern their models. Now on to developers. Modernizing applications is mission-critical to any company\u2019s operations today. And with GitHub, Visual Studio and Azure PaaS services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools to help. GitHub is now home to 100 million developers and GitHub Copilot is the first at-scale AI product built for this era, fundamentally transforming developer productivity. More than 1 million people have used Copilot to-date. This quarter, we brought Copilot to businesses and we have seen strong interest and early adoption from companies, including Duolingo, Lemonade and Volkswagen Cariad Software Group. Now on to Power Platform. Power Platform is becoming an essential digital transformation tool as every business looks to streamline their operations and drive productivity in today\u2019s environment. We are helping customers realize superior time to value with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools, automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. We are leading in robotic process automation. Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers from AT&T to Rabobank, up over 50% year-over-year. And we are making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows. Now on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is taking share as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience and supply chain functions. For example, G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service. FUJIFILM is optimizing its operations. Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence. Baylor Scott & White in Texas is using our digital contact center to enhance patient communications. And this quarter, we introduced our new Supply Chain Platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. Now on to Industry Solutions. Our industry and cross-industry clouds are driving pull-through for our entire tech stack. Our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF last week as we introduced new tools to help retailers manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores. Polish retailer Zabka has built the largest chain of autonomous stores in Europe with the help of our technology. In Financial Services, our new partnership with London Stock Exchange Group will deliver next generation of data analytics and workspace solutions. And in healthcare, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any provider looking to generate real value from AI. With Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, physicians can reduce documentation time by half, improving the quality of their patient interactions. Now on to systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva are essential for every organization to adapt to the new world of work. Microsoft 365 is rapidly evolving into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications as well as new applications like Designer, Stream and Loop. We have more than 63 million consumer subscribers, up 12% year-over-year and we introduced Microsoft 365 Basic, bringing our premium offerings to more people. Teams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter, showing durable momentum since the pandemic and we continue to take share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling. Teams has emerged as a first-class platform. Apps from Adobe, Atlassian, Poly, ServiceNow and Workday have each surpassed 0.5 million active users and the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40% year-over-year. There are more than 500,000 active Teams Rooms devices, up 70% year-over-year and the number of customers with more than 1,000 rooms doubled year-over-year. Novo Nordisk will deploy Teams Rooms to 5,000 meeting rooms globally in our largest deal to-date. Teams Phone continues to take share and is the market leader in cloud calling. We have added more than 5 million PSTN seats over the last 12 months alone. With Teams Premium, we are meeting enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered recaps. We have seen strong interest in preview and we will make it broadly available next month. With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new market category for our employee experience and organizational productivity. U.S. Bank is using Viva to streamline employee communications and Carlsberg turned to Viva to centralize its digital employee experience for 29,000 employees. In today\u2019s environment, aligning the entire organization and the most important work is critical. Viva Goals brings objectives and key results directly into the flow of daily work. Viva has also become an indispensable tool for business process. Viva Sales is the super app in Microsoft 365 for sellers. We have seen strong interest since making it generally available this quarter. All up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365. 80% of our enterprise customers use 5 or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, IKEA, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto as well as the state government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to Windows. While the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre-pandemic with time spent per PC up nearly 10%. Monthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter. And for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition. We are also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over two-thirds year-over-year. Leaders in every industry from Campari and Grant Thornton UK to Nutrien and Woolworths are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500. Now on to security. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms. We are the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management and privacy informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day. We are taking share across all major categories we serve. Customers are consolidating on our security stack in order to reduce risk, complexity and cost. The number of organizations with four or more workloads increased over 40% year-over-year. UK retailer Fraser Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft. Roku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory. And Astellas Pharma, Ferrovial and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIM capabilities. Now on to LinkedIn. People and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members. Three members are signing up every second. Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year-over-year. Skills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe and trusted platform. Now on to advertising. Despite headwinds in the ad market, we continue to innovate across our first and third-party portfolios. Our browser, Microsoft Edge gained share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Bing continues to gain share in the United States and daily users of our Start personalized content feed increased over 30% year-over-year. We are now empowering retailers and expanding our third-party inventory. With PromoteIQ, we are building a complete omnichannel media platform for companies like the Australian retailer, Endeavor, as well as Canada\u2019s Hudson\u2019s Bay and Global, the largest Brazilian TV broadcasters chose Xandr to launch a new media buying platform in that market. Now on to gaming. In gaming, we continue to pursue our ambition to give players more choice to play great games wherever, whenever and however they want. We saw new highs for Game Pass subscriptions, game streaming hours and monthly active devices, and monthly active users surpassed a record 120 million during the quarter. We continue to invest to add value to Game Pass. This quarter, we partnered with Riot Games to make the company\u2019s PC and mobile games, along with premium content available to subscribers. And finally, we are energized by our upcoming lineup of AAA game launches, including exciting new titles from ZeniMax and Xbox Game Studios and we will be sharing details in Gameplay at our showcase tomorrow. In closing, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. We will continue to pursue our long-term opportunity and innovation agenda with urgency while also raising the bar on our operational excellence. With that, I will hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019d like to start by reiterating Satya\u2019s thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week\u2019s announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion, and earnings per share by $0.12. Our second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2% and 7% in constant currency. When adjusted for the charge, gross margin dollars increased 2% and 8% in constant currency, operating income decreased 3% and increased 6% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.32, which decreased 6% and increased 2% in constant currency. In our consumer business, the PC market was in line with our expectations, but execution challenges impacted our Surface business. Advertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. In our commercial business, we delivered strong growth in line with our expectations. However, as you heard from Satya, we are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment and we saw results weaken through December. We saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the standalone Office 365, EMS and Windows commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong execution in many regions around the world. However, performance in the U.S. was weaker than expected. Importantly, we continued to see share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security and Edge. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new standalone business noted earlier. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 29% to 26% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 24% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 32%. Our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points, in line with expectations. At a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by 6 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. FX impact on Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing were both in line with expectations. Additionally, FX decreased both COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $27.1 billion and grew 22% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point better than expected, driven by lower energy costs. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 67%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points, driven by a lower mix of Windows OEM revenue and sales mix shift from licensing to cloud. Operating expense when adjusted for the Q2 charge increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, about $500 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by investments in cloud engineering, the Nuance acquisition and LinkedIn. At a total company level, headcount ended December 19% higher than a year ago. Sequential headcount growth was less than 1%. Year-over-year growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Adjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points, primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact as well as a lower mix of OEM revenue. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7% and 13% in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 12% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw some impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. Office Consumer revenue declined 2% and increased 3% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 63.2 million, partially offset by declines in our transactional business. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 14% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 13% and 20% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 21% and 29% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, including roughly 5 points from the Q2 charge. Operating income increased 6% and 17% in constant currency as the 3 points of favorable impact due to the change in accounting estimate were offset by 3 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $21.5 billion, increasing 18% and 24% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 20% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% and 38% in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate, particularly in December, and we exited the quarter with Azure constant currency growth in the mid-30s. In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 16% to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 2% in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 2% and 7% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs. Operating expenses increased 34% and 37% in constant currency, including roughly 13 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and roughly 7 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 7% and 15% in constant currency as roughly 7 points of favorable impact of the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately 7 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19% and 16% in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial and search. Windows OEM revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 36% on a strong prior year comparable. Devices revenue decreased 39% to 34% in constant currency, below expectations due to execution challenges on new product launches. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue declined 3% and increased 3% in constant currency, lower than expected, primarily due to the slowdown in growth of new business and stand-alone offerings noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, a bit lower than expected, as noted earlier. Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly 6 points of benefit. And in gaming, revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 12% and 8% in constant currency, given the strong first-party content last year. Segment gross margin dollars declined 29% and 24% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 7 points year-over-year, driven by lower device gross margin and sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6% and 9% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and 3 points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47% and 40% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision as well as higher employee and supplier payments. Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7% and free cash flow declined 16%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million, lower than anticipated, driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 3 points, COGS growth by 1 point and operating expense growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 4 points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points in Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels. And LinkedIn and search will be impacted as ad market spending remains a bit cautious. In our Commercial business, we expect business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3. While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution, given our strong position in global growth markets. In commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and the strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat over year. We expect consistent execution across our core and sales motions and continued commitments to our platform will be offset by impact from the slowdown of new business noted earlier and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Our data center investments continue to be based on a near-term and longer-term customer demand, including AI opportunities. Next, segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or $16.9 billion to $17.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 1 point on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with continued strong engagement on the platform, although impacted by the advertising trends noted earlier and the slowdown in hiring, particularly in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365, which is now over 80% of total Dynamics revenue. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 19% in constant currency or $21.7 billion to $22 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid-30s in constant currency. And from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly 4 to 5 points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about 1 point more than at the segment level. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $11.9 billion to $12.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline in the mid to high 30s, in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels. In devices, revenues should decline in the mid-40s as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services on a strong prior year comparable, revenue should be relatively flat as customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions will be partially offset by the slowdown in new business noted earlier. Search and news advertising ex-TAC should grow high single digits, roughly 7 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and the inclusion of Xandr. And in gaming, on a prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low single digits as growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be more than offset by lower monetization per hour and third-party and first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 1% and 2% in constant currency or to be between $15.65 billion and $15.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 11% and 12% at constant currency or be $14.7 billion to $14.8 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $200 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains and losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision. Now some thoughts on H2 and the full year. First, in our Commercial business, revenue grew 20% on a constant currency basis in H1. However, we now expect to see a deceleration in H2, given how we exited December. Next, higher energy costs for the full year are now expected to be $500 million compared to our previous estimate of $800 million. Third, as we continue to prioritize our investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, our Q4 operating expense growth should be in the low single digits in constant currency. Finally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning cost and growth, investing in our customer success and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs. In the first half of the year, over 70% of our revenue came from our Commercial business and over 70% of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation and durable growth markets where we are gaining share. I\u2019m confident in the ability of our Microsoft team to manage the near-term by continuing to position ourselves for the future. With that, let\u2019s go to Q&A. Brett?\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We will now move over to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. I was hoping we could delve into the expansion of the investment into OpenAI. Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us about, is there any expansion in the scope of what you guys are doing with OpenAI and the commitment that you guys are making in terms of sort of the compute capacity you\u2019re going to be giving to them? And then maybe as from an investor\u2019s perspective, how should we think about when this functionality is going to become \u2013 expand beyond just sort of the Azure OpenAI services? And where are we\u2019 going to start to see some of the positive impacts to perhaps Bing or the productivity suite or more broadly across the solution portfolio?\nSatya Nadella: Thank you so much, Keith, for the question. So as you know, we started the OpenAI partnership now in 3 years, 3.5 years ago. And we\u2019ve been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last 3 years. And so I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI and we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack and also create new solutions and new opportunities. So whenever we think about platform opportunities and platform shift opportunities, that\u2019s how we come at it. How can we essentially ride the wave for everything that we have today and make it more expansive and then what new can be created. So, if you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute storage and network come together. That\u2019s, in some sense, under the radar, if you will, for the last 3.5 years, 4 years, we have been working very, very hard to build both the training supercomputers and now, of course, the inference infrastructure because once you use AI inside of your applications, it goes from just being training-heavy to inference. So, that\u2019s sort of, I think core Azure itself is being transformed for the core infrastructure business, it\u2019s being transformed. And so you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services even, think about what Synapse plus OpenAI APIs can do. We already have in Power Platform incorporated capability. You could prompt - I mean one of the reasons why we are the leaders in robotic process automation and workflow automation today is because of some of the AI capabilities that we have in there. GitHub Copilot is in fact, you would say, the most at-scale LLM based product out there in the marketplace today. And so, we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it\u2019s in productivity, whether it\u2019s in our consumer services. And so we are excited about it. But I think that we are also excited about OpenAI zone innovation, right. So, they commercialize their products. We are excited about the Chat GPT being built on Azure and having the traction it has. So, we look to both, there is an investment part to it and there is a commercial partnership. But fundamentally, it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to drive, I think innovation and competitive differentiation in every one of the Microsoft solutions by leading in AI.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Steve. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Satya, can you give us your overall macro view? There were some comments you had made that concerned, I think many about the state of the U.S. spending environment. I am just curious if you could comment and follow-up on what you are seeing there just from a spend environment throughout the year. I think many came away with that perceiving that you were saying it\u2019s getting worse, not better. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brent. And first of all, I was making a comment which was sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean there is only \u2013 I always sort of subscribe to that there is only one law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world. And then how many times that do we grow, because as I have said in my comments, Brent, I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher and on a secular basis. So, the question is how many times is it given the overall inflation-adjusted economic growth. So, that\u2019s kind of how I look at it. Given that, I think the two things that we see, we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it\u2019s even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic. They are making sure that they are getting most value out of it or optimizing it and then also being a bit more cautious on given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market. So, given those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what [Indiscernible] into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. And so one of the key things we are watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this space through our value propositions, so and even build loyalty with our customers so that long-term, we are well positioned for share gains. So, that\u2019s sort of fundamentally how we view it.  And then the other aspect I would also say is simultaneously investing in this new AI trend, because I don\u2019t think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They are all going to have considerations around how is my AI inference performance, cost, model is going to look like, and that\u2019s where we are well positioned again. So, that\u2019s how I view it. The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what\u2019s happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads and that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis, as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Brent. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. I would like to follow-up a little bit on this question relating to optimization. I know we saw some slowing this quarter. You are guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is \u2013 do you believe at this point is truly people optimizing what they have already bought and stepping that before that versus how much of that is due to macro factors themselves specifically impacting demand?\nSatya Nadella: I would say two things, and then Amy, please feel free to add. One is, it absolutely is, starts with workloads that they have at scale just because of the visibility one has on what\u2019s driving essentially the consumption meters. And there is real guidance that we ourselves [Indiscernible] the product to say, here are the things that you could do optimize your billing. And so \u2013 so, that\u2019s sort of what is the fundamental thing, when we say do more with less and how can we help, that\u2019s sort of the first place customers go to.  And then the next piece, really, I think is going to be about how they take the optimization that they get and the savings they get along workload and what new project starts. And that\u2019s where I think there is a reprioritization, when should we start the new project. And those are the two things that are happening simultaneously. They don\u2019t perfectly match, but one of the things is they are looking to back some savings on some workloads and then start. So, that\u2019s where I think a little bit of what has to happen is the cycle time where the optimization cycle finishes, the projects start and then the projects ramp. And I think that, that\u2019s what at least on the cloud consumption side you are seeing. And on the per user side, it\u2019s slightly different, which is in per user also, there was real acceleration when it comes to purchases of per user licenses, whether it is for knowledge workers or frontline workers. And again, they are all now making sure that they are all getting used and the usage is going up. Like when we look at our Office 365 usage, all those numbers are pretty up year-over-year in a substantial way. Like I gave you some of the Teams numbers, in fact, one of the things was what will happen to the Teams usage after the pandemic, guess what, they\u2019re up. And so those are the good news. And now once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added and premium, like I am very, very excited about Teams Pro coming out in a couple of weeks. And those are all the things that people will be able to sort of use to ensure that the ARPUs are also going up with value.\nAmy Hood: And Mark, because I do think it\u2019s actually quite hard to separate from a driver perspective how much is optimization versus macro. It\u2019s all related when you start to say what\u2019s the best ROI I can get on every budget dollar I spend in our job as a partner to so many of these customers is to help them do that. So, Satya has talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product where the cycle is going to be a little longer, right, and you are going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5. You can see the ARPU growth and you can see the consistency potentially in both renewal rate and in, frankly, the Microsoft 365 performance.\nMark Moerdler: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nBrett Iversen: Yes. Thanks Mark. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Satya, I am curious if you could talk about how long the cycle time for optimization lasts. Are we talking a couple of quarters, few quarters or multiple years, because I do take your comment about tech spending as a percentage of global GDP going higher? So, if that were to happen, this \u2013 how do you frame the duration of this optimization that\u2019s happening in the industry? Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: I mean I think that you can \u2013 you have a workload, you optimize the workload and you start a new workload. So, the thing that I would say is when you are done with optimizing a workload is when you are done with the cycle. So, I think if you sort of say, when did we enter this, we accelerated existing [ph] workloads during the pandemic over a period of 2 years. So, we are optimizing. I don\u2019t think we are going to take 2 years to optimize, but we are going to take this year to optimize. And then as we optimize the new projects start and the new project starts don\u2019t start instantly at their peak usage. They start and then they scale. And so those are the two cycles that will happen where there will be a time lag.\nKash Rangan: Got it. So, it\u2019s a temporary adjustment before we start to get the full effect of the next set of workloads. Good to get that.\nSatya Nadella: That\u2019s correct.\nKash Rangan: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Kash. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. This one for Amy. Amy, given the obviously tough environment, it sounds like reaching that full fiscal year 20% constant currency commercial revs guide would be tough. Is that also true for the soft guidance for 10%-plus total revenue growth for the year? And if I could just sneak in a clarification, Amy, just because it\u2019s an important metric. When you talk about a 4-point to 5-point decel in Azure, that\u2019s off of the 38% reported for December, right, not off the 35% exit rate? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: It\u2019s all \u2013 Karl, let me just \u2013 the first half of your question, give me a second. On the second half of your question, which is the guide of the exit rate \u2013 it\u2019s off the exit rate on Azure of four points to five points, just to make sure that is clear. In terms of thinking about total year revenue, right, I did not comment on full year revenue as we continue, I think really just to watch the Windows PC market as it returns to pre-pandemic levels. Outside of that, as you can see, the trends are relatively consistent. So, in some points, it\u2019s important because if you look at the operating income margin guidance that I talked about, the fact that we are guiding to really only one point of margin deceleration for the year on a constant currency basis with probably over $2 billion of headwind from the OEM business from what we had anticipated heading into the year, the focus on margins, the focus on prioritization, the focus on putting our investments into where we know they have high return, I actually feel quite good about the place that puts us in as we exit the year in terms of \u2013 and the right energy, right, or leaving the year in Q4 on leverage.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks Amy.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Karl. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much. Amy, I wanted to ask about the expense actions that you announced last week, obviously, not a decision that you would take lightly. How are you thinking about headcount for the remainder of the year and the possibility for further expense actions, if necessary? And what criteria do you consider in making these decisions? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Brad, listen, thanks for that question. Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low-single digit operating expense growth, we start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year. And we lapped the acquisitions both of Nuance and of Xandr. So, by the time that we get to the end of Q4, you will see very moderated headcount growth on a year-over-year basis in addition to some of the prioritization decisions we have made. And you are right. We take decisions like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue just incredibly seriously because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that. And so I do think that we feel confident in that exit rate. And as I have said, it will certainly imply that year-over-year growth as we lap some of the investments that we have made will be quite small.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks for the color.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Brad. Joe, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. On Office 365 Commercial, with you guys approaching 400 million seats and the E5 business really starting to accelerate here on that consolidated sort of expense ROI that you are putting forth, should we think about the growth there more evenly balanced between seats and ARPU going forward or still to continue to favor seats? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Yes. That\u2019s a good question, especially because this quarter you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question and I will just reinforce it, as we see some of this moderating seat growth, whether that\u2019s some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the standalone stuff, you are starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. So, it does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number. So, we are seeing still good seat growth, still growth across all workloads. And as you are pointing out, we are getting further into the E5 health, where we have seen, I want to say, four or four really good quarters of E5 adoption. The value there is just very high for customers in this environment between analytics, security, and I think we have given some, I think good security data points in terms of adoption. And voice, this is a place where customers can save money by moving to this suite. And I do think you are starting to see some of that ARPU help.\nSatya Nadella: And we are also investing in outside of Microsoft 365 in other per user workloads. We were being a new suite, Power Platform on its own and even standalone offers like even Teams Pro and what have you. So, there is a significant amount of work we want to do besides sort of the suites that we all sort of have at scale.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thank you very much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Brad. Joe, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask just about how your visibility has changed in terms of some of the larger Azure customer ramps. Could you just comment on, to the extent those large customer ramps or if any of those projects are getting put on pause? And then is there any way to just kind of quantify the AI potential contribution or maybe GPU-powered contribution that Azure that you are expecting over the coming quarters? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: And on the second piece, I think it\u2019s too early to sort of start somehow separating out AI from the rest of the workload. I mean even the workloads themselves, AI is just going to be a core part of a workload in Azure versus just AI alone. So, in other words, if you have an application that\u2019s using a bunch of inference, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s also going to have a bunch of storage and it\u2019s going to have a bunch of other compute beyond GPU inferencing, if you will. So, I think over time, obviously, I think every app is going to be an AI app. That\u2019s I think the best way to think about this transformation. On your characterization of the large customers, whether there is any changes in their trajectory, I would say I would point back to, I think some of the commentary around every large customer is looking to optimize the workloads that they have at scale today and plowed some of that money back that they save into new project stock. So, that\u2019s sort of what the classic pattern of large customers is. Sometimes you have ISVs who are different, right. So, if an ISV is optimizing, they are optimizing and say, what is the [Technical Difficulty]\nAmy Hood: Hello. Do you want me to move? Hello. Do you want me to use the backup?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brett Iversen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nBrett Iversen: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella : Thank you, Brett. To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times. First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend where digital technology as a percentage of world's GDP will continue to increase. Second, we'll prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend, so that they can do more with less. And finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure. With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24% and 31% in constant currency. And based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20% in constant currency this fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business. With that, let me highlight our progress starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We're also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services, including containerized applications across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud, companies like [Chobani] (ph), Munich Re, Sodexo, Volvo Cars, all run SAP on Azure. We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running an Oracle Cloud infrastructure, making it possible for companies like FedEx, GE and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And with Azure Confidential Computing, we're enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud. Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50% of its applications to Azure. Now to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, helping customers cut integration tax associated with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding workloads at limitless scale. Cosmos DB now supports postscript SQL, making Azure the first cloud provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and no SQL workloads. And in AI, we are turning the world's most advanced models into platforms for customers. Earlier this month, we brought the power of DALL-E to Azure OpenAI service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation model to commercial use cases for the first time. In Azure machine learning, provides industry-leading ML apps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage and govern models. All up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100% for four quarters in a row. Now on to developers. We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud native applications. Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And GitHub's developer first ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud on any platform up three times. GitHub advanced security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into the developer's workflow. Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications. Now on to Power Platform. We are helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite spanning Low-Code/No-Code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for reporting and analytics. Power Apps is the market leader in Low-Code/No-Code tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50% compared to a year ago. Power Automate has more than seven million monthly active users and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mass, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And we're going further with new AI-powered capabilities and power automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows. Now on to Dynamics 365. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants. And Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility. All up more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications. Now on to Industry Solutions. We are seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds. Bank of Queensland chose our cloud for financial services to deliver new digital experiences for its customers. Our cloud for sustainability is off to a fast start as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their environmental footprint. New updates provide insights on hard-to-measure Scope 3 carbon emissions, and we are seeing record growth in healthcare, driven, in part, by our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solutions, which automatically documents patient encounters at the point of care. Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings. Now on to new systems of work, Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today's digitally connected distributed world of work. Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people work and every type of worker reducing cost and complexity for IT. The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations. Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we have gained and are seeing increased engagement, too. Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average. In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more features within Teams increased over 20% year-over-year. Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third-party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60% year-over-year, and over 55% of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone. Teams Phone provides the best-in-class calling. PSTN users have grown by double digits for five quarters in a row. We are bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively. And we are creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help organizations evolve and manage the space for hybrid and in-person work. Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where. We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for advanced meeting features like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. We've also built a completely new suite for our employee experience platform, Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly active users at companies like Finastra, SES and Unilever. And we are extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system. Now on to Windows. Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues to see usage growth. All up, there are nearly 20% more monthly active Windows devices than pre-pandemic. And on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5% more time on their PCs than they were 2.5 years ago. And we are seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11. Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employees' PCs, up from just 25,000, 7 months ago, and L'Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees. Now to security. Security continues to be a top priority for every organization. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance, identity and device management and privacy across all clouds and platforms. More than 860,000 organizations across every industry from BP and Fuji Film to ING Bank, iHeartMedia and Lumen Technologies now use our security solutions, up 33% year-over-year. They can save up to 60% when they consolidate our security stack, and the number of customers with more than four workloads have increased 50% year-over-year. More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIM to secure their entire digital estate. The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44% year-over-year. And as threats become more sophisticated, we are innovating to protect customers. New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps life cycle and manage security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premise and cloud-based user directories. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2x the pace as in the United States. There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on LinkedIn, up 4x year-over-year. New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning helped companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in the flow of work. Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months, up 43% year-over-year. And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next-generation sales navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal sizes by better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solution continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising. More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketeer or advertiser looking to innovate. We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4x over the past year. We are seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start and Bing driven by Windows. Edge is the fastest-growing browser on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon price comparison features to save money. We surface more than $2 billion in savings to date. And this quarter, we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets. Users of our Start, personalized content feed are consuming 2x more content compared to a year ago. And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory. Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month, exclusively powered by our technology and sales. And with PromoteIQ we offer an omni-channel media platform for retailers like the auto group looking to generate additional revenue while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now onto gaming. We are adding new gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach players wherever and whenever they want on any device. We saw usage growth across all platforms driven by the strength of console. PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159% year-over-year. And with cloud gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed. More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to date. And we are adding support for new devices like handhelds from Logitech and Razor as well as Meta Quest. And as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming with Game Pass and Xbox Series S, nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem. In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.35, increased 4% and 11% in constant currency when adjusted for the net tax benefit for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Driven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations even as we saw many of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continued to weaken through Q1. In our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. As you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings with a growth of 31% in constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses. Commercial bookings declined 3% and increased 16% in constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal execution, and we continue to see growth in the number of large long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the $10 million plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 34% in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, and our annuity mix increased one point year-over-year to 96%. FX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger US dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by five points, and at the segment level, FX decreased productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud revenue growth by six points and more personal computing revenue growth by three points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by three points. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly two points year-over-year to 73%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly one point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy costs. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%, excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier and Nuance. Operating expense increased 15% and 18% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in key areas just mentioned, as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Operating income increased 6% and 15% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results in Office commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 7% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected, with the strong renewal execution noted earlier. Growth was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw a continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. Office consumer revenue grew 7% and 11% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 13% to $61.3 million. Dynamics revenue grew 15% and 22% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24% and 32% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in marketing solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13% and 16% in constant currency, and operating income increased 10% and 19% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20% and 26% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 28% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 35% and 42% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth, as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 18% to over 232 million seats, with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat, and increased 4% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by hybrid demand, including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 10% in constant currency, driven by enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 26% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly three points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly eight points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 17% and 25% in constant currency with roughly nine points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate. Now to more Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-year to $13.3 billion and grew 3% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall, but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in gaming consoles. Windows OEM revenue decreased 15% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20%, driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier. Devices revenue grew 2% and 8% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by the impact of a large Hollands deal, partially offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 16% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from an increase in search volumes and roughly five points of impact from Xandr even as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter. And in gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13% and 19% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3% and increased 1% in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party content as well as in third-party content where we had lower engagement hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly five points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2% and 5% in constant currency, driven by the Xandr acquisition. And operating income decreased 15% and 9% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $6.6 billion, and cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2%, and free cash flow was relatively unchanged [indiscernible] year. This quarter, other income and expense was $54 million, driven by interest income, which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from AC [ph] division, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately five points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly seven points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, six points in Intelligent Cloud and three points in more Personal Computing. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1, continue into Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue, and impact both Windows OEM and Surface device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing our advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and Search and News advertising revenue. In our commercial business, demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, together with consistent execution, should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a moderately growing expiry base against a strong prior year comparable, which included a significant volume of large long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly one point year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly two points driven by lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy cost, revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from Nuance. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or USD16.6 billion to USD 16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth from E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-30s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in mid to high single-digit revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low double digits or the low 20s in constant currency, driven by continued share gains in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 22% and 24% in constant currency or US$ 21.25 billion to US$ 21.55 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption, with some impact from the Q1 trends noted earlier. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. In our on-premise server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits, as demand for our hybrid solutions, including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of US$ 14.5 billion to US$ 14.9 billion. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s, reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. In Devices, revenue should decline approximately 30%, again, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. Search and news advertising, ex TAC, should grow in the low to mid-teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens against a strong prior year comparable. That included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency or to be between US$ 17.4 billion and US$ 17.6 billion, and operating expense to grow between 17% and 18% in constant currency, or to be between US$ 14.3 billion and US$ 14.4 billion. As we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million, as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements through Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.4 billion cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. Now some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly five-point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points. At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20% constant currency growth in our commercial business, driven by strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market. With the high margins in our Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater than expected energy cost, we now expect operating margins in US dollars to be down roughly a point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact of the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY 2023 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year. In closing, in this environment, it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, Security, Teams, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem solving innovations to our customers. And while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally. And you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially through the year. While we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we've made over the last year. With that, let's go to Q&A. Brett?\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others in the call, we request our participants to please ask only one question. Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and impressive results in what's obviously a very difficult environment. A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point. But I think this is what's on a lot of investors' minds. This is two quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth came in a little bit below your guidance. I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering about is the -- is there an inherent volatility in that business that's just harder to forecast? And on a go-forward basis, how should we think about that forecast? Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure growth like the glide path for the whole year? If you could address those, I think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease.\nAmy Hood : Thanks, Keith. And I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, you've heard me say it, we've been a point better, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point worse. And I want to focus mostly on what, and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus, both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. And as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so it's this nuance of you're still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business, and yet you still want to optimize your workloads, you still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth. We saw that across all segments. If there was one segment, well, I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or midsized segment of the market that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point. I know that, people are focused on. But if you step back and say, this is how you drive ultimate share gains and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well. And so as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it's in customer success, whether it's in optimizations, whether it's frankly an engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity in TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in technology. I don't know, Satya, if you...\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. I mean, I think that's the only thing I would add, Amy, to your point is that obviously, our investment profile here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good growth rates with the kind of volatility you're seeing. So we're going to stay focused on it. And in this particular period, I think we are going to optimize for long-term customer loyalty, by proactively helping them optimize their spend, which I think is the right thing for us to be doing as a company for \u2013 on behalf our shareholders long term.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Thank you guys.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Jesse, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. I'd like to follow-up on the last question on Azure specifically. So next quarter, you're guiding to sequential further slowing in the business. Is that the factor of optimization? Is it something else that's going on in here? How should we think about that specific component of the guidance, given the fact that you've got good bookings, strong RPO growth, et cetera?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Mark. I'll \u2013 you're right. Let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you're referring to, we had what we would call long-dated growth, which means we're having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform, and that goes really to what Satya mentioned is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so it's about both the optimization that you're talking about, and we are seeing and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workload starting. And those also may not be matched up one-to-one to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility. The other piece of it, Mark that we didn't talk on before because I was really focused on consumption is that there is per user headwinds as well, right, because we're getting and seeing some of these [loss] (ph) of large numbers in terms of the per seat business. So there's a couple of things going on here Mark again, as you said, a very large base. So it's not just the optimization to new workloads. It's also some per user work as well.\nMark Moerdler: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Jesse, next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Amy, last quarter, you called out, for the first time, SMB weakness. It sounds like that continued. I think many are questioning if did that get worse this quarter? And did you see it filter now into the enterprise? Can you talk about what you're seeing higher up above SMB?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about Microsoft 365. I think that's a place where we can talk specifically about the SMB market because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4. In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution. And it speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft 365. We had on-time renewals that were frankly better in Q1 based on expirations than we've seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting done on time. They're getting done within a discount range that we feel good about. That's consistent. And we saw a good upsell to E5. So if you think about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB, that's a good summary. Where we, in fact, saw -- I think we've talked about it, new deal moderation, and I referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well -- it tended to be in, to your point, the smaller end of the market, small to midsized companies. And it also tended to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent a little bit, and I referred to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some new value that we put into E3. So this is a place where there is some macro impact, but there's also, I think, a better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition. We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto [packaging] (ph) for Windows. It's a great value in the same way E5 is. We landed E5 really well. We've got some work to do on landing E3. So there is some macro, seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than inconsistent with what we saw. And there is some execution that, I think, frankly, we can get better at as well.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Jesse, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you, very much. Satya, this quarter, we're seeing an inflection in many of your AI breakthroughs, thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation in your designer product. What is it that's enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially to be first to market? I'm wondering if it\u2019s the OpenAI relationship or maybe some of your inferencing capabilities or something else? And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like $200 million per quarter? And then, is there anything you can do to try to manage that through this period?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks for the question. First, yes, the OpenAI partnership is a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps, it's sort of important to call out that we built the supercomputing capability inside of Azure, which is highly differentiated, the way computing the network, in particular, come together in order to support these large-scale training of these platform models or foundation models has been very critical. That's what's driven, in fact, the progress OpenAI has been making. And of course, we then productized it as part of Azure OpenAI services. And that's what you're seeing both being used by our own first-party applications, whether it's the GitHub Copilot or Design even inside match. And then, of course, the third parties like Mattel. And so, we're very excited about that. We have a lot sort of more sort of talk about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you'll see more advances on the GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area of huge investment. The AI comment clearly has arrived. And it's going to be part of every product, whether it's, in fact, you mentioned Power Platform, because that's another area we are innovating in terms of corporate all of these AI models. So, yes, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability at an infrastructure layer for training and inference and the model that sells or platforms for third parties and our first-party applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models.\nAmy Hood: And to your question on energy cost, let me try to provide a little bit of help there. We did not see as big of that. As I said, it's over $800 million for the year. Some of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2 through 4. And I think if you want to think about it, it's somewhere 250-ish a quarter. It's not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the remainder of the year.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Mark. Chessie, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Amy, I'd love to just ask you on margins. Clearly, you're experiencing a little bit more sales mix given the weakness on the Windows side. It looks like you've elected not to throttle back OpEx to enable you to meet the three months ago guidance for flat margins, so they'll now drift a little bit lower. Do you mind talking through that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows pressure?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. And I shared a little bit on the call, but let me share a little more, because I think it's important in terms of how we think about investment and continuing to invest where we're seeing substantial opportunity and growth. The PC market is cyclical. And we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic, and we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line, and you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did that potentially because it is a cyclical market. And so in the same way I see it now is that PCs are going to be a tough headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows back to the installed base, our ability to grow usage, it's still higher than it was. And that's a good opportunity for us. And so in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it's important to stay consistent in this down market because when you have type of opportunity that we have specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked about has been some of our most exciting. And you have the opportunity with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it's important to have a steady hand. Now, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It will be about investing where we said we would invest, which is in focused areas. It's about moving headcount to make sure inside the company, we've got it on the highest and most important things. We've added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months. And we want to make sure we use those head count in the most productive way possible, and we're going to do that. And also, we're going to, frankly, lap some investments that we've made at the end of H2, Karl. We closed Nuance at the end of Q3. We closed Xandr in Q4. When we come and lap those, you will see a material decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we'll see productivity improvements from the headcount have and our focus. And so it's an ability to say, absolutely, I want to stay consistent, and we'll respond to the macro. It's possible to do both those things, and I think that's what we're doing.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl, Jessie, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question \nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about Office Commercial. A lot of the growth here is driven by subscriber growth. This quarter, for example, 17% constant currency, subscriber growth of 14%. Could you remind us where the incremental subscribers coming from? Could we see that mix of growth shift away from subscribers towards ASP potentially over time? I think you're already over 300 million subscribers. So just any color on just the runway from? Where is the increment C coming from and with all the works that you're doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security analytics, might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber growth over time? Thank you so much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brad. It's a good question because you've continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways because we're focusing on frontline worker scenarios, we're continuing to focus on small size business growth, and we're adding new things to which you can grow, whether that's Viva, whether it's Teams. There's new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value and then to add seats. And so I don't want to say it has to be, again, this vision of or. So I think you'll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what we've been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we've added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well. And so you will see, right, over time, long term the seat growth move a little bit, and then you'll see ASPs show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more ARPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1 that had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there's room to do both those things, and I felt that way now for a couple of years.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Amy.\nBrett Iversen: Thank, Brad. Jesse, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks you. Satya or Amy, as a follow-up on Azure, I'm curious how you foresee the magnitude of two different variables on cloud computing demand over the near to medium term. The first being economic pressures on the willingness of some customers to spend, and the second being the impact of the spiking energy cost perhaps as a facilitator for something to do more in the cloud. Do you see these as largely offsetting factors, or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent than the latter? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. I mean the way we see it is, overall, macro will mean that everybody is going to optimize their build. In fact, as Amy said, our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them, helping customers \u201cdo more with less\u201d. So that's sort of one side. The thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So we see the value prop of the cloud. So the big winner in all of this will be public cloud, because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk. The other side, as you described today, is the risk around supply chain or energy costs. And so that's another one best way to hedge against an energy cost and we, in fact, more energy efficient, is to move to the cloud. So that's where I think a little bit of \u2013 as you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say, this is a period where cloud gain share because we're still in the early innings of adoption. And so we just want to invest going into it, but that might set and build long-term customer loyalty.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen : Thanks, Gregg. Jesse, we have time for one last question,\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question here. Helpful color on cloud. I wanted to pivot to advertising. This was a segment that crossed over $10 billion, I think, earlier this year. Netflix rolling out ad-supported model next year powered by Microsoft, what is the broader Microsoft advertising ambitions maybe three to five years here, given these are very large and very profitable segments that Microsoft has not historically focused on? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Thanks for the question. We are \u2013 yeah, our core advertising business has got two elements to it. One is, I'll call it, LinkedIn B2B advertising, where we clearly have a leadership position around both reach, quality of ROI, and will -- of course, it will be cyclically impacted, but we feel that the LinkedIn Engage continues to grow. And as that market comes back, our premium position LinkedIn owned and operated, I feel well very well positioned. We'll continue to invest in that space. The second point is the place where we are, again, very, very focused on. First, starting with our owned and operated. So when we talk about the overall active devices on Windows have grown by 20% over the pandemic. One of the big opportunities it opens up is for us to tick our own and operated inventory, right, whether it is Bing and Search, whether it's the Feed. And those are things that you see some of the growth. We are share takers in the browser. We are share takers in terms of engagement of the feed. And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the installed base that's now structurally changed in terms of growth. And then the third-party with Netflix, we're really excited about that, and we're going to look to grow our -- and first make Netflix a successful partner, but we're going to continue to grow our third-party business on the ad platform. So those would be the three areas: LinkedIn; our own top printed advertising, both search and feed; as well as third-party ad network.\nBrett Iversen : Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood : Thank you.\nSatya Nadella : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All-up, annual revenue was more than $245 billion, up 15% year-over-year. And Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital intensive investments. And as we go through this shift, we are focused on two fundamental things: First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity, while in parallel continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals, starting with security. Second, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable, long-term operating leverage. With that, let me highlight examples, starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year, driven by AI. We expanded our datacenter footprint, announcing investments across four continents. These are long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first party silicon Azure Maia. And we introduced new Cobalt 100, which provides best-in-class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake, and Teradata. We continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry, from ABB and Cathay Pacific, to LaLiga, to streamline their cloud migrations. We now have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90% year-over-year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads. Atos, Coles, Daimler Truck AG, Domino\u2019s, Haleon, for example, all migrated their mission-critical SAP workloads to our cloud. And with our Azure VMware Solution, we offer the fastest and most cost-effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads too. With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers\u2019 unique cost, latency, and design considerations. All-up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year-over-year, and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI Service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including as of this quarter GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It is being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho, and Zomato. With Phi-3, we offer a family of powerful, small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union, and others. And with Models as a Service, we provide API access to third-party models, including as of last week the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. The number of paid Models as a Service customers more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry, from Adobe and Bridgestone, to Novo Nordisk and Palantir. Now, on to data. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year-over-year. Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered next generation data platform \u2013 now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry, from Accenture and Kroger, to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss up 20% quarter-over-quarter. And, this quarter, we introduced new first-of-their-kind real-time intelligence capabilities in Fabric so customers can unlock insights on high-volume, time sensitive data. Now, on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI-powered developer tool. Just over two years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx, and H&M, to Infosys and Paytm have adopted Copilot, up 180% year-over-year. And we are going further. With Copilot Workspace, we offer Copilot-native end-to-end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug, and deploy cycle. Copilot is driving GitHub growth, all up, GitHub\u2019s annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion. Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year, and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter-over-quarter. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year-over-year. Now, on to future of work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, as it transforms work, workflow, and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter. Feedback has been positive, with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats. All-up, the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis. And EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. And we are going further, adding agent capabilities to Copilot. New Team Copilot can facilitate meetings, and create and assign tasks. And, with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom copilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporation, Cognizant, and Eaton, to KPMG, Majesco, and McKinsey have used Copilot Studio, up over 70% quarter-over-quarter. We are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare, with DAX Copilot. More than 400 healthcare organizations including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have purchased DAX Copilot to date, up 40% quarter-over-quarter, and the number of AI-generated clinical reports more than tripled. Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter, as customers like ThermoFisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot-first solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-800 Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptek will rely on it to deliver better customer support. And Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP. Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. We once again saw year-over-year usage growth. Teams Premium has surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400% year-over-year, as organizations like dentsu, Eli Lilly, and Ford chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of Copilot+ PCs this quarter. They are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever, and they include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews. And we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year-over-year. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E.ON, National Australia Bank. Now, on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning, and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. Over 1,000 paid customers used Copilot for Security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW. And we are also securing customers\u2019 AI deployments, with updates to Defender and Purview. All-up, we now have over 1.2 million security customers. Over 800,000 including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom use four or more workloads, up 25% year-over-year. And Defender for Cloud, our cloud security solution, surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Now, let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform. And video is now the fastest growing format on LinkedIn, with uploads up 34% year-over-year. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe, trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, Premium sign ups increased 51% this fiscal year, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools. Our reimagined AI-powered LinkedIn Premium experience is now available for every Premium subscriber worldwide, helping them more easily and intuitively connect to opportunity, learn, and get career coaching. Finally, hiring took share for the second consecutive year. And, now, on to Search, Advertising and News. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge, and Copilot collectively are driving more engagement and value to end-users, publishers, and advertisers. Our overall revenue ex-TAC increased 19% year-over-year, and we again took share across Bing and Edge. We continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to a user\u2019s query, while maintaining click share to publishers. And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12 billion images and conduct 13 billion chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And, in fact, we have paid them $1 billion over the last five years. We are helping advertisers increase their ROI too. We have seen positive response to Performance Max, which uses AI to dynamically create and optimize ads. And Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language. Now, on to gaming. We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. 18 of them such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on the devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TVs. Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the second most watched title on the platform ever, and hours played on Game Pass for Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter-over-quarter. In closing, I am energized about the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long-term in our fundamentals, in our innovation, and in our people. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% and 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform. Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency. This record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of 10-million-dollar-plus and 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on operating income growth, and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party, and includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 69% in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 14% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected results across all business units. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 13% and 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to 82.5 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16% driven by Dynamics 365 which grew 19% and 20% in constant currency. We saw continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income increased 12% and 13% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28.5 billion, increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI services where demand remained higher than our available capacity. In June, we saw slightly lower-than-expected growth in a few European geos. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281 million seats with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions although with slightly lower-than-expected transactional purchasing. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.9 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Windows commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations, as we remain focused on our higher margin premium products. While early days, we\u2019re excited about the recent launch of our Copilot+ PCs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 19%, ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in Gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61%, slightly ahead of expectations, with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% and 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21%, with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $19 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $13.9 billion. Cloud and AI related spend represents nearly all of total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease datacenters that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. For the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI related spend was similar to Q4. Cash flow from operations was $37.2 billion, up 29% driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full-year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $675 million, more favorable than anticipated with lower-than-expected interest expense and higher-than-expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $34 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full-year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY2025. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full-year revenue, COGS, or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers. To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY2025 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY2024. As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management. Therefore, we expect FY2025 OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about one point year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY2025 effective tax rate to be around 19%. Now, to the outlook for our first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than one point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand, as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency, or US$20.3 to US$20.6 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high-teens. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate. And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline in the low single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency, or US$14.9 billion to US$15.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high-teens. This will be higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s, driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.95 billion to US$20.15 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$15.2 billion to US$15.3 billion, including approximately $200 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly three points year-over-year even as we accelerated our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition, and had a headwind from the change of useful lives last year. So, as we begin FY2025, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead aligned, and if needed adjusted, to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that, the AI platform, and we feel well positioned as we start FY2025. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around Generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth? Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those investments? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's the product \u2013 shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure meters as well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our customers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say \u2013 and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's the demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60-plus percent is the kit, that only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully, we can even have things which are semi-constructed, we call [cold] (ph) shelves and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage, to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.\nAmy Hood: And Keith, I do think \u2013 and I really do appreciate how you phrased the question as well because I think the timing and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about capital expense in our comments \u2013 in my comments today. Being able to maybe share a little more about that when we talked about roughly half of FY2024's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases, and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond. And they're incredibly flexible because we've built a consistent architecture first with the Commercial Cloud and second with the Azure stack for AI, regardless of whether the demand at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties and partners or, frankly, our first-party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So it's long-lived flexible assets. And if you think about it, that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe. Because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the Cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes, it rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo and this one because we have demand on a global basis. We are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully, with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.\nKeith Weiss: That's super helpful. Thank you very much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a strong year. GenAI has been a bit of rollercoaster of a tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with Cloud, it took time for margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long-term from all the investment on AI? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Thanks again, Mark, for the question. So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That's a pretty good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is one, we are gaining share. We are \u2013 Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for \u2013 we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think, how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.\nAmy Hood: And, Mark, to answer the second half of your question on margin improvement, looking different than it did through the last cloud cycle. That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to one Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making one. We're using that internally first-party, and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs. So it does, in fact, make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKasthuri Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much and congrats on a great year \u2013 fiscal year ending. A question for you, Amy. When you look at the CapEx, how do you ring efficiencies out of the CapEx? You've disclosed that 50% of the infrastructure, the other 50% tech, is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and Generative AI? That's the main question in my mind? Thank you so much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really two pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate. And the answer to that is yes because there's two different pieces, right? You're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned, the pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand-driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect, and we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understand to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter-to-quarter. The other thing, I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number, and on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E and you're going to start to see that more often in this period because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned it back in my comments before, but I mentioned it again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and hopefully that's helpful context.\nSatya Nadella: Just one other thing, Amy, if I wanted to add. I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about \u2013 we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time. So those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset. Land, network, construction, the system or the kit and then the ongoing cost. And so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.\nKasthuri Rangan: Thank you. It was triggered by the jump in CapEx. And as Amy pointed out, you're guiding to accelerating Azure revenue growth rate, which, I guess, follows the CapEx surge. Thank you so much once again.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Amy, the magnitude to beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on sales cycle that close rates that you saw? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Actually, no. As I was talking on the quarter, I mean Commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter. Commitments were very good execution across both the core sort of annuity renewal motion was good, as expected, the larger long-term commitments were better than we expected. So Brent, I would not say there was anything really unusual in how I thought about what we saw in our commercial execution through the quarter.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high-end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta. I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments. There's two things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half? And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it, just so people can hear it in my words as well to that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end of 30%. You're exactly right. The distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end, really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non-AI consumption really made the difference in that number. And we've assumed that going forward into H1 inclusive of my guide 28% to 29% going forward. And then let me separate which was your larger point, which is what are the other factors you see ongoing. Number one, you're right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure will remain in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Thank you, Amy.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand, once again greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build-out and acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about Cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near-term and long-term strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and Cohere, for example? Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brad. Maybe separate a couple of things. We are \u2013 and we've talked about now for quite a few quarters, we are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually, we've, to your point, have signed up with third parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity. We've done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform, to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit as we've talked about in builds so that we can get back in a more balanced place.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I mean, to me, it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. These \u2013 you could even say sometimes buying from Oracle, maybe even more efficient leases because they're even shorter date.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thanks for the color.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. With a couple of quarters of Copilot for M365 availability under your belt now, how are you assessing the capability of Copilots to replicate the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge workers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 feet deals, the repeat purchases, is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rate equally high in office as they will be in GitHub?\nSatya Nadella: Yes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue, you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now \u2013 for example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right? So this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and workout effect, all being driven by Copilots.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could, for a second. Xbox content services revenue grew 61%, 58 points held from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer-term growth potential in this area? You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming? Or what are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it?\nAmy Hood: No. I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks more like to us, the software annuity and subscription business. With enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long-term. As Satya mentioned, things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements. Thank you, Keith.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

It was a record third quarter, powered by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack, spanning everyday productivity, business process, and developer services, to models, data, and infrastructure, are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry. Now, I\u2019ll highlight examples, walking up the stack, starting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share, as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service. We also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and cost-effective SLM available. It\u2019s already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC, and TCS. Our Models as a Service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers, from Accenture and EY, to Schneider Electric, are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including as of this quarter the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. And, as part of a partnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All-up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and average spend continues to increase. We also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like DICK'S Sporting Goods and World Bank streamline their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2X year-over-year. And, we are the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L'Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure. Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion dollar plus multi-year commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company. The number of $100 million plus Azure deals increased over 80% year-over-year, while the number of $10 million plus deals more than doubled. Now, on to data and analytics. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance, and AI. Over half of our Azure AI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB with deep integrations with Azure AI. TomTom is a great example. They\u2019ve used Cosmos DB along with Azure Open AI service to build their own immersive in-car infotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric. Fabric now has over 11,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU and Lumen, and we are seeing increased usage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that\u2019s consolidated in Fabric\u2019s multi-cloud data lake, OneLake. And Power BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over 350,000 paid customers. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itau, Lufthansa Systems, Nokia, Pinterest and Volvo cars. CoPilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform, too. AT&T, Citi Group and Honeywell all increased their overall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with CoPilot. All up more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers and revenue accelerated over 45% year-over-year. Anyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it easier to build an app, automate workflow or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations, across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing query handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds. All up over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100 have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year-over-year. Now on to future of work, we are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion and knowledge are to productivity of an organization. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns, thus having a cascading effect changing work, work artifacts and workflows and driving better decision-making, collaboration and efficiency. This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all types and sizes from enterprises to small businesses, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries and geographies with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody\u2019s, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA, and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000 seats. We\u2019re also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in Teams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge. And we\u2019re not stopping there. We\u2019re accelerating our innovation, adding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year. With Copilot and Dynamics 365, we are helping businesses transform every role in business function as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O\u2019Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. And with our Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from dynamics, as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own co-pilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work. When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter-over-quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new category of devices, purpose-built for this new generation of AI. All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months. And this quarter, we introduced new surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on-device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there is much more to come in just a few weeks, we\u2019ll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. When it comes to Teams, we once again saw year-over-year usage growth. We\u2019re rolling out a new version, which is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory to all customers. We surpassed 1 million Teams Rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. And Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year. All of this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365 companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark. All chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. We are also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 health care organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health Care and WellSpan Health. And in manufacturing, this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens and Volvo Penta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations. Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack, and it's our number one priority. We launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else, before all other features and investments. We are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets, protect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation. We remain committed to sharing our learnings, tools and innovation with customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights. Now let me talk about our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way members learn, sell and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job seekers, saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which has reached over 12 million contributions are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn Premium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strength across our other businesses with hiring taking share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines and descriptions. Now on to gaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices. We set third quarter records for game streaming hours, console usage and monthly active devices. And last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title Diablo IV to our Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by ongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists. Finally, we are expanding our games to new platforms, bringing four of our fan favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had seven games among the top 25 on the PlayStation store more than any other publisher. In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and businesses thrive in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share. A reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge. And in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 41% with 43 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. When compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come. In FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services. So we will manage that signal through the year. We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage. And therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. With that, let\u2019s go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. A lot of excitement in the marketplace around generative AI and the potential of these technologies, but there\u2019s also a lot of investment going on behind them. It looks like Microsoft is on track to ramp CapEx over 50% year-on-year this year to over $50 billion. And there\u2019s media speculation of more spending ahead with some reports talking about like $100 billion data center. So obviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution. But what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how use as the management team, try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments because they are getting very big. And maybe if you could give us some hint on whether there's any truth to the potential of like $100 billion data center out there? Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith for the question, let me start and then Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right? There is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward. Then Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure. And it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely. So we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years. So this is not the quarter. I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays. But if you look at it, we have been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to sort of essentially keep taking that forward.\nAmy Hood: And Keith, I do think it's important to really think about our planning cycles and we do talk about spending sequentially higher. And we look forward to being able to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to meet the demand. Another thing that you\u2019ve really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process. And so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important. It's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade. Watch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Satya, how would you characterize the demand environment? On one hand, you have bookings in Azure both accelerating year-over-year in the quarter, but we're seeing a lot of future concern hesitation from other vendors we all cover. So, I think everyone love to get your sense of budget health for customers this year.\nSatya Nadella: Great question, Brent. There are a couple of things I\u2019d say. On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the \u2013 we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one. The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI. And so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction. So, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well. So, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize. So, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulates on the quarter and the guidance. I want to follow up on the AI, obviously. We\u2019re seeing companies shifting their IT spending to invest in and learn about AI rather than receiving additional budgets for AI. At some point, for AI to be transformative, as everyone expects, it needs to be accretive to spending. Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level, will be net increase to IT or outside of IT spending? And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation? And Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure? Some projects are being delayed so that, that spending could be shifted from core Azure toward Azure AI? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Great set of questions, Mark. Let me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right? That\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. We see that in customer service. We see that in sales. We see that in marketing. Anywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns. You can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations. When I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions. And so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences. So, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process. And we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development. We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize. And so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with. And so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change.\nAmy Hood: And Mark, maybe to answer your question on, are we seeing project starts transition from maybe the \u2013 something that was core consumption to an AI project? In our results, that\u2019s not what we saw. We saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is, you see maybe growth in migrations again. You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts. And I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO. It\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing. And I do think that will be important as we think about the opportunity ahead.\nMark Moerdler: Incredibly helpful. Thank you both.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. And Satya and Amy, congrats on these outstanding Azure results. I\u2019d love to hone in a little bit on the seven-point lift to Azure growth from AI, outstanding number, but it\u2019s leveling off a little bit from six points in December. I\u2019m wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. To what extent did the capacity issues that you Amy highlighted on the call, impact that number? Is there any seasonality? I wouldn\u2019t think so or any other factor that can swing around that number that you\u2019d advise us to keep in mind? Thanks so much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. There\u2019s not a seasonality to the numbers. So, you\u2019re absolutely right to start there, and it\u2019s a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular. And so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. I have more conceptual question for Satya. If you think about Copilots and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of this in businesses and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain Copilots versus like the rest of the industry following and everyone seems to have a Copilot now and seems to be talking about it. How does that impact what do you want to do, your partner strategy going forward? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question. So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right? So it's not like \u2013 when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work, they're doing knowledge work and support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to note. And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data. So when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing. In fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so now you can access all that data right in the Team's context. So that's I think what's exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say we're under underappreciated for the amount of work. How people use those tools to make progress on business process, but we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools, tomorrow horizontally.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Raimo. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMichael Turrin: Hey. Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to go back to Azure. You've been hinting at stabilization there for the past couple of quarters, but still very good to see the balance. Maybe you can expand on just what the commercial bookings number, appreciating the variability there does in terms of visibility. And any characterization you can give us around what you're seeing in areas like cost optimization and core workload growth coming back is just helpful context for us in unpacking the numbers. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Michael. I may take those a bit in reverse. It's a little easier to address them. When you think about \u2013 we've been talking about sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl was 7 points of contribution from AI, and you could call them the difference '24 from our core really Azure business. And within that, the activity we saw and the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations. And then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal. We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows. The companies are still going from on-prem to cloud, Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects. This is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos. So I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload. What are we seeing? Where it starts? And this one actually felt quite balanced and optimization looks like they normally would, which by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do. You want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that. So I sometimes think we \u2013 you all may ask the question more as a negative. And for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level.\nMichael Turrin: Consistent core cloud growth is still pretty exciting to us as well. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll add my congrats in the quarter. Hey Satya, I was wondering if you could chime in on a discussion that comes up a lot with investors, which is, is there a sort of data quality problem in the market in terms of being able to take advantage of all these new GenAI capabilities? And I was just curious, if you could comment on, do you see companies making inroads on sort of addressing that? And do you see that as sort of an inhibitor to AI growth at all at this point? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question because there are two sets of things in order to make sense for successful deployment of these new AI capabilities. I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does two things, right? There's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right? So people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful. And then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises. So all that's maturing. So we feel good. And this is what I think on the commercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios. Whereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right? It's just not an AI model. It's the, AI \u2013 the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work. And effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding. But you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask the AI question but from a Microsoft 365 Copilot perspective. I think you talked a little bit about starting to see some of those impacts positively in the quarter on the office business. I wanted to ask more broadly around that capacity constraint that you alluded to in your prepared remarks, Amy. And kind of how does the easing \u2013 how tied are we like as you invest for that CapEx and bring more of the capacity online. How much does that unlock or unlock the ability to deliver both a higher Azure AI number as well as a higher Microsoft 365 Copilot number.\nAmy Hood: Thanks for the question. It's a good opportunity to clarify. And I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots. It's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per user businesses are able to continue to grow. And so think about that as our priority one. And so then what that does mean is capacity constraints when we have them, you'll tend to see them on the Azure infrastructure side, the consumption side of the business is a better way of thinking about it\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you all.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure. We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers, over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLM's from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure, without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models, but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM-5 for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how it's millions of customers\u2019 shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide. Now on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All-up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all-up platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply-chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation, to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks. And overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access. We also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all-up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2 times year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems, we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cyber security protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with [indiscernible]. New AI features, including more personalized emails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to-date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want, hours streamed increased 44% year-over-year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our line-up of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises, which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels [Technical Difficulty] Gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost. At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant-currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency, with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant-currency, below expectations primarily [Technical Difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid-for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid-for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis. First FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services and more Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full-fiscal year. First FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income, when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related cost. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2. Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution. So our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for letting me ask the question. Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you deliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI [aiming] (ph) to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly AI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows? Second point. On AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to see pick-up in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: You want me to go first and...\nAmy Hood: You go first and I'll take the technical.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, let me -- just on the inferencing and training, most of what you've seen for the most part is all inferencing. So, none of the large model training stuff is in any of our higher numbers at all. What small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there, but that's sort of a minor part. So, most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing. And Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about, like what is the new workload in AI? The new workload in AI, obviously, in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI. But it's not just about just one model, right. So, you first -- you take that model, you do RLHF, you may do some fine-tuning, you do retrieval, which means you are sort of either heating some storage meter or you're heating some compute meters. And so to -- and by the way, you will also distil a large model to a small model and that would be a training perhaps. But that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. So, I think that's what's happening. So you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is they'll get rebuilt, then there'll be continuously optimized over time. So, that's sort of one-side. And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization, and I think last quarter we said. One, we're going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads, they will optimize the workloads and then they'll start new workloads. So I think that that's what we continue to see. But that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workloads start, that I think has ended at this point. So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.\nAmy Hood: No, maybe I'll just add just a few things to that. I think whether you use the word lapping, these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, is all sort of the same thing, that we're getting to that point, in H2 that's absolutely true. We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI specifically for the reason Satya talked about, these are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale. And we want to be able to show people, this is how that point will work, it's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue and so, I do think about those as both related. And ultimately the TAM that we go after is best sort of across both of those, both AI workload and I guess, \u201cnon-AI workload\u201d although to Satya's point, you need all of it.\nMark Moerdler: Perfect. Thank you very much for the deep answer.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking to most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting into AI. I'm curious if you could just walk through, how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that, Q2 because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say, sort of a run-rate margin improvement. So, let me first say that. Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good and it speaks to, I think one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that, we want really to make sure we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on, is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work. And I think that's important, because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use, but in what people are working on day-to-day. That does obviously create a leverage opportunity. There has also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products; we talked about it with Office 365, we talked about in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year. And so, when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of re-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage. And we still need to be investing. And so, the important part, invest towards the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. And so it's a great question. And hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Amy.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Joe next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. A superb quarter of great improvements. Just one question for you Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer, the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much.\nSatya Nadella: Yes, I think it's going to have a very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so, I think in the network, the memory architecture, all of it. So as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there is a full, like, take our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute we'll have traditional SQL, we\u2019ll have Spark. And by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lakehouse pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of those different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean if you think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilots extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds. I mean. I do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI. But now, AI is just redefining what it means to have, what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.\nKash Rangan: Terrific. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Joe, our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. I wanted to return to AI, the six point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary. But I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand. If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU-constrained. Is the success you've had maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that some of the other cloud infrastructure providers have talked about, a little bit maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting. Thank you.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start and Satya feel free to add on. I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen us scale through that process. And that is going toward as we talked about Servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward. And so, I do feel like the team has done a very good job. I feel like, primarily obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand. And I think looking forward, you'll tend to C&I guide toward it, accelerated capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much for taking the question. The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 copilot is very powerful. Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back, and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: No, thank you for the question, Brad. So, a couple of things. In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever two months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so, from that perspective. It's exciting to see, I\u2019d say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right. I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back-in-the day of PC adoption, right. It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right. So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, If you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like number-one, like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting documents. So, anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right. I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said, I should be watching out for next quarter and it will come out with great detail. And so Chat, summarization, draft, also by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is, here's the Word document, go complete, I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So, those are the stuff that is also beginning. So, I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and work flow changed, right. You can imagine what forecasting was before excel and email and what it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster. Chat to get knowledge from your business. And so, those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.\nAmy Hood: And maybe just to add two points. One of the exciting things as I said for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like PC, for other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month, it's really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too. And the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait and then it gets deployed, and then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this, in some ways with Copilot even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly. But really what we're seeing is engagement grow. As to Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes you see engagement grow with time. And so I think those are just to put a pin in that, because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent, thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yeah. Thank you very much. Is it possible to unpack the 6 point AI services tailwind, it's just to help us understand which elements ramped up by the three incremental points. For instance, is it more of the open AI inferencing, GitHub Copilot, other Copilots, the Azure OpenAI service, third party LLMs running on Azure. I'm just wondering, where did you see the strongest step-up in that activity?\nAmy Hood: Mark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as really, it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API generally. I mean that's the easiest way to think about it. And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot which you talked -- which Satya talked about and we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some small ways for training. But this is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number. We used to think of it that way.\nSatya Nadella: Azure OpenAI and then OpenAIs on APIs on top of Azure would be the sort of the major drivers. But there is a lot of the small batch training that goes on, whether it's let Jeff for fine-tuning. And then lot of people who are you starting to use models as a service with all the other new models, but it's predominantly Azure open AI today.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Amy for many, many years in Commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU and over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look-forward, should they run even for a period of time or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: That's a great question, Brad. Let me split apart the components. And then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectory and I will explain why I say that. Your seat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-size businesses and really frontline workers scenarios. And to your point on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but there are also -- there are new seats and so you see that in the seat count number. And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter, but a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over-time from E3. Then from E5. And we're continuing to see very healthy seat momentum and you heard very good renewals. So, all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth. Then the next thing, that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question I'm trying to recall is that, you're going to see Copilot revenue will run there as ARPU, right. That won't show a seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot, all show-up in ARPU over time, and then you\u2019ll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios. So, I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not. I think about them as sort of unique Independent motions we run and there is still room for seat growth and obviously with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thanks very much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Joe we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.\nTyler Radke: Thanks for taking my question. Satya your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week. I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing, obviously, this is driving pretty incredible breakthroughs and productivity for developers. But how do you think about your ability to drive ARPU on the GitHub Copilot over-time and just talk us through how you're thinking about the next phase of new releases there?\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. I mean -- it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT. And then it's use inside of developer scenario with GitHub copilot and so yes. I think this is the place where it's most evolved. In terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits and you see it. We see it inside of Microsoft, we see it in all of the key studies we put out of customers, everybody had talked to its pick-up, but it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer is like if you takeaways spell check from Word, I'll be unemployable. And similarly, it will be like -- I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development. The thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right. So you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right. I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they're pretty low.. You know even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we had a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's sales copilot or service copilot or GitHub Copilot of security copilot. They are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx, right. So it's like 2 points, 3 points of OpEx leverage would be goal is on software spend. I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation. And so that's the first time, I mean this is not something we've been able to make the case for before whereas now I think we have that case. Then even the horizontal copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level, even there, you can make the same argument whatever ARPU we may even have with E5, now, you can see incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a copilot to give you more time savings for example. And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even in their productivity and how we participate. And I think GitHub copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity and now you're seeing that transition, it is just not tools, it's about productivity of your dev team.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Tyler. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, driven by the continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack, and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure again took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as, the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. And we also have our AI services deployed in more regions, than any other cloud provider. This quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 Virtual Machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting specific cost latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI services, including new to Azure customers. And we are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs as leading AI start-ups use OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore, making them Azure customers as well. We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We're meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers up 140% year-over-year. We are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud. Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads too. Companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, ZEISS, and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data, in the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate, that's why with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions today. And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytical solution with an all-inclusive business model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55%, while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users and more than 37,000 organizations have subscribed to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter-over-quarter with significant traction outside the United States. This quarter we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as, leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers. All up, the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago. We've also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot in Power Platform to date. EY for example has enabled Copilot for all 170,000 plus Power Platform users at the company. And this quarter we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages making it possible to build a data-driven website using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader and low-code no-code development, now with 20 million monthly active users, up 40% year-over-year. Now on to business applications, all-up Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter. We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our Sales Copilot help sellers that more than 15,000 organizations including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance, personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas, to faster access to valuable business data. And this quarter, we introduced Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service, to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date. And with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative AI models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast United States credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We are also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and SingHealth to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world. Now on to the future of work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook, and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp, and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week. This quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat (ph). And the new Copilot Lab helps employees build new work habits for this era of AI, by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to 2 times faster, while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration. We've seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams Store, and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian and Workday, each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. And with Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations. With skills in Viva, we're bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps, and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work. All up, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365, and companies across the private and public sectors including Cerberus, Chanel, and DXC Technology, all rely on our Premium E5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows, the PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels and we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever adding 150 new features including new AI-powered experiences in apps, like, Clipchamp, Paint, and Photos, and we introduced Copilot in Windows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context to the web, your work data and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC. Finally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we're making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled and security is the number one priority for CIOs worldwide. We see high-demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta have been using Copilot in Preview, and early feedback has been positive. And we look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program, so they can improve the productivity of their own, security operation centers and stop threats at machine speeds. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve, and our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel now has more than 25,000 customers in revenue, surpassed $1 billion annual run-rate, and customers in every industry like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thornton and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environments. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell and get hired. Membership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including our learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines, and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers and marketers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say, it saved them time. And we have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter. More broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year-over-year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year-over-year and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With our Copilot for the Web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as, support for DALL-E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images with more than 1.8 billion images have been created to-date. And with our Copilot and Shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new endpoints, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketeers to customer intent in chat experiences, both from us as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming. We were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any endpoint. Already with Game Pass, we're redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter. We released Starfield this quarter to broader acclaim, more than 11 million people have played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold, and with Activision Blizzard King, we now adds significant depth to our content portfolio. We will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls and Gears of War. And we're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineups ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations. I encourage you to tune in. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter's revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 and increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. Results exceeded expectations and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses, as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5 and growth of new business continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected the optimization trends were similar to Q4. Higher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. And our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend, landed roughly in line with our expectations and in gaming strong engagement helped by the Starfield launch benefited Xbox content and services. Commercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, with continued growth in the number of $10 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation, increased 18% to $212 billion, and roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 20% and this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvements in Azure. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, the gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost-efficiency focus as well as investments that shifted to future quarters. Operating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 48%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 six points, driven by improved operating leverage through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more in-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth, as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 10% year-over-year, with installed-base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to 76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though we continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue, grew 22% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly, 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses increased to 2% and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI Services. While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base, grew 11% to over 259 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5. Devices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex-TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year-over-year, driven primarily by sales mix-shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1% and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher-than-anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a U.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition. Our outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration, and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately 1 point. We expect FX to have no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals. The growth will be impacted by a low growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 Cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% or $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency. We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1st, and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions. Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environment for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18% or $25.1 billion to $25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which as a reminder can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. For H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2. And our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline by low-to-mid single digits. Now to more Personal Computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect revenue of $16.5 billion to $16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid-to-high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be mid-single digits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength, supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement, as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. A reminder that this ex-TAC growth will be roughly 4 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high 40s. This includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which as a reminder includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid-to-high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $19.4 billion to $19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of $15.5 billion to $15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related cost from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million, as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now, some additional thoughts on H2 as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, Activision, we expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For a full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity, while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year. In closing, with our strong start to FY '24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave. With that. Let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants, please ask only one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new products garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment, that remains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this, one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?\nSatya Nadella: Maybe I can start, Keith, and Amy you can add to it. Overall there are multiple things, Keith, they're all happening obviously simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize, where's the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like, for example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. The second thing, of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI. Given our leadership position, we are seeing complete new projects start, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters, they have lots of other cloud meters as well. So that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side, obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of value. And so we are in the very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.\nAmy Hood: Keith, maybe just a few things to add and then I'll talk a little bit about the operating leverage, which is the second part of your question. In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings, so that when we're asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services, that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios. And so I think that is an important piece as you think about, stability and commercial demand. And then if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full-year guidance that, now, even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, and integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating margins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements, we're making in Azure and even in Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we are delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand we see. And, although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every dollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave. And so I think that focus is really helping on both execution and leverage.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations on a really strong quarter. AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI devstack Copilot reference architecture and plugin architecture bidding a meaningful factor, not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us any color on whether Azure GPU is predominantly model training or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks.\nSatya Nadella: No. Thank you for the question, Mark. Yeah, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT or Bing Chat or all our Copilots, all share the same model. So in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that we used -- which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale. And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization internally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see the sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which the developers are riding is much higher up than low-level kernels if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open source models or proprietary models. We also have a bunch of open source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds of ways people use it. But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service\u2026\nAmy Hood: And the reason, Mark, that's important is that it means, even beyond the point Satya made is that, when it comes to our ability to leverage the infrastructure that we're building out, we don't really have a preference in terms of how people are utilizing that infrastructure, whether it's through all the means that Satya mentioned. It gives us a good opportunity to see quick conversion into revenue.\nSatya Nadella: Yeah. I mean, one other thing I'd just add to perhaps Mark's question as well as Keith's is, this platform transition, I think is very important for us to be very disciplined on both. I'll call our tech stack as well as our capital spend all to be concentrated. The lesson learned from the cloud side is -- we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses, it's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio, and that, I think, is going to be very important because that discipline, given what the spend like -- it will look like for this AI transition any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble.\nMark Moerdler: Extremely helpful. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Amy. Good to see the 12% growth. Many investors are asking, can you sustain double-digit growth, especially with a stronger AI boost coming in the next several quarters?\nAmy Hood: I think looking at our -- as I said, Q1 was a strong start to the year, Q2 certainly implies that. We've talked about stability for Azure into the second half of the year looking at and in line with what we're seeing for Q2. And so I think we feel good about our ability to execute, but more importantly, our ability to continue to take share.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the office space with Copilot coming out now very soon. Can you speak a little bit about -- what you're seeing in the customer base that tested this already in terms of how excited they were -- the special features there, and what does it mean in terms of adoption curve for that going forward once you go GA on 1st of November? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: No. Thanks. The question, Ramo, the good news is two-fold, one is the fact that, what is 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product and I think you all have also done lots of checks and the feedback is very, very positive. And, in fact, the interesting thing is, it's not any one tool, right? Which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to create documents, in Excel to, do analysis, or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams just like that. Clearly, the Teams meeting, which is an intelligent recap, it's not just a dumb transcript. It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so we are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is, by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles, we are seeing productivity gains like we saw with developers and GitHub Copilot. So that's the data. We are very excited about our Ignite conference, where we will talk a lot more about all of the use cases and what's -- where's the value and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far so good, as far as the data is and the feedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product, I mean, at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp, and it's incrementally priced, so, therefore that all will apply still. But at least for something completely new to have this level of usage already and this level of excitement is something we're very, very pleased with.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Thanks, Amy. Congrats on the 28% constant currency Azure growth, that's terrific. I wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're obviously guiding to a 1 to 2 point decel in December and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the -- in the second half of your fiscal year, if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued Core ex-AI Azure spend optimization, continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative, but I'd just love to understand it? Thanks so much.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Karl. A couple of things. As I talked about Q2 and then into H2. We've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers are going to continue to do that. It's an important part of running workloads that is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated, but that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers, both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities. And so I think that impact remains through the rest of the year, and my view is unchanged on that. And then of course, I think the key component has always been new workload starts. And at the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business, does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts. And primarily we're expecting those to come from AI workloads. But AI workloads don't just use our AI services. They use data services and they use other things. And so that combination, I think, looking on a competitive basis, we feel good about our execution, we feel good about taking share and we feel good about consistent trends. And so I feel good about that guide and what it says about where we are on share.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Terrific. Thanks.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nBradley Sills: Wonderful. Thanks so much. Very impressive to see the Office 365 commercial seat growth hanging in here in that double digit range. It's very impressive just given the scale of that business. We think of Office as having such a dominant market position. Curious, how you think about the -- where that seat is coming from and how many more of those seats are out there to go get?\nAmy Hood: Thanks for that question, and maybe I'll take that Satya if you -- if you want to add. In general, our seat growth has -- it does come from all segments, but with particular strength in small and mid-sized businesses, as well as what we call the frontline worker opportunity. And that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters where the majority of our seat growth has gone. And while obviously, it slowed a bit to your point, I think the fact that we're still able to add seats at this level speaks to the broadening nature of what Microsoft 365 needs. It's more applicable to more people. And so I think many people have thought, oh my goodness, you've got a lot of customers already. And we look and say, how many people when you expand what Microsoft 365 means, whether it's the security or it means analytics or it means Teams, it means lots of things in an expanding definition. It applies to more types of workers. And frankly, the value is such, especially on the small business front, where it's to the point where I think people feel like it's a great way to spend even the spend money they have is -- this remains a pretty compelling offer.\nBradley Sills: Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. One thing that really stood out to me was the intelligent cloud segment operating margins. These came in, I think, at the highest level in six years, despite elevated AI investments. Was there a one-time tailwind here that helped? Or are you at the point where Azure has got economies of scale, where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?\nAmy Hood: You think -- thanks for that question. I think there are a couple things going on and I do -- I would say in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it, absolutely is that help the operating leverage. The second component of that is in our core Azure business. The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that, and so that's been helpful as well. And then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment, to make sure we're focusing that work on leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so you're right, even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it'll also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin. But this does have a slightly -- as I talked about earlier, easier comp in Q1 and Q2, given it was some of our highest growth operating expense quarters in our company's history a year ago.\nBrent Bracelin: Makes sense. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. And maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about, but on the gross margin line. Amy, the Microsoft cloud gross margin is up 2 points year-over-year, excluding the useful life change, a little more improvement than we've seen in some time and some investors were worried that it might go in the other direction, given increased AI investments. And so, as you look forward, do you think that you could drive some continued gross margin improvement over the medium term and even as higher CapEx will filter into the model? Thanks.\nAmy Hood: Yeah. Let me break that into two components, because they're both important and it's a really good question, Gregg. On our core business, the core Azure business, the core Office 365, M365 business, Dynamics business, they're -- they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And so that, like in other quarters has helped this quarter. In addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it, if you have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers, then every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we will have great leverage, because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for training workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue, or on our Bing workloads. I mean, I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame. And so when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same growth in revenue. And I think on occasion, you may see something pick up 1 or 2 points and the other one not quite get there, but the point is, it's going to be very well paired because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years, to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.\nSatya Nadella: And I'll just add that it'll be very well paired at the company level. I realize all of you care a lot about each one of our segments and each one of our KPIs, and I do too, but at the end of the day, our stack and the way it works, the way we do our capital allocation, the way we think about even the optimization of the demand to utilization is across the entirety of all of our segments and all of our products.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thanks.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Gregg. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for join us today and we look-forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood: Thank you.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts and workflow across every role, function, and business process, helping customers drive new growth and operating leverage. All up, our AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which will make it the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure took share this quarter. We are seeing continued growth in cloud migration. Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, including American Tower, CTT, L'Or\u00e9al, up more than 80% year-over-year. We now have data centers in over 60 regions around the world. And this quarter, we announced new cloud and AI infrastructure investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden as we expand our capacity in line with our long-term demand signals. At the silicon layer, our new Cobalt 100 VMs are being used by companies like Databricks, Elastic, Siemens, Snowflake, and Synopsys to power their general-purpose workloads at up to 50% better price performance than previous generations. On top of this, we are building out our next-generation AI infrastructure, innovating across the full stack to optimize our fleet for AI workloads. We offer the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including our first-party accelerator, Maia 100 as well as the latest GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. In fact, we are the first cloud to bring up NVIDIA's Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. Our partnership with OpenAI also continues to deliver results. We have an economic interest in a company that has grown significantly in value, and we have built differentiated IP and are driving revenue momentum. More broadly with Azure AI, we are building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own Copilots and agents. Azure OpenAI usage more than doubled over the past six months as both digital natives like Grammarly and Harvey as well as established enterprises like Bajaj Finance, Hitachi, KT, and LG move apps from test to production. GE Aerospace, for example, used Azure OpenAI to build a new digital assistant for all 52,000 of its employees. In just three months, it has been used to conduct over 500,000 internal queries and process more than 200,000 documents. And this quarter, we added support for OpenAI's newest model family, o1. We're also bringing industry-specific models through Azure AI, including a collection of best-in-class multimodal models for medical imaging. And with the GitHub models, we now provide access to our full model catalog directly within the GitHub developer workflow. Azure AI is also increasingly an on-ramp to our data and analytics services. As developers build new AI apps on Azure, we have seen an acceleration of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL DB hyperscale usage as customers like Air India, Novo Nordisk, Telefonica, Toyota Motors North America, and Uniper take advantage of capabilities, purpose-built for AI applications. And with Microsoft Fabric, we provide a single AI-powered platform to help customers like Chanel, EY, KPMG, Swiss Air, and Syndigo unify their data across clouds. We now have over 16,000 paid Fabric customers, over 70% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is changing the way the world builds software. Copilot enterprise customers increased 55% quarter-over-quarter as companies like AMD and Flutter Entertainment tailor Copilot to their own code base. And we are introducing the next phase of AI code generation, making GitHub Copilot agentic across the developer workflow. GitHub Copilot Workspace is a developer environment which leverages agents from start to finish so developers can go from spec to plan to code all in natural language. Copilot Auto Fix is an AI agent that helps developers at companies like Asurion and Auto Group fix vulnerabilities in their code over 3x faster than it would take them on their own. We're also continuing to build on GitHub's open platform ethos by making more models available via GitHub Copilot. And we are expanding the reach of GitHub to a new segment of developers introducing GitHub Spark, which enables anyone to build apps in natural language. Already, we have brought generative AI to Power Platform to help customers use low-code, no-code tools to cut costs and development time. To date, nearly 600,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 4x year-over-year. Citizen developers at ZF, for example, built apps simply by describing what they need using natural language. And this quarter, we introduced new ways for customers to apply AI to streamline complex workflows with Power Automate. Now on to work. We launched the next wave of Microsoft 365 Copilot innovation last month, bringing together Web, Work, and Pages as the new design system for knowledge work. Pages is the first new digital artifact for the AI age, and it's designed to help you ideate with AI and collaborate with other people. We've also made Microsoft 365 Copilot responses 2x faster and improved response quality by nearly 3x. This innovation is driving accelerated usage, and the number of people using Microsoft 365 daily more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We are also seeing increased adoption from customers in every industry as they use Microsoft 365 Copilot to drive real business value. Vodafone, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 68,000 employees after a trial showed that, on average, they save three hours per person per week. And UBS will deploy 50,000 seats in our largest finserve deal to date. And we continue to see enterprise customers coming back to buy more seats. All up, nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, and customers continue to adopt it at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. Copilot is the UI for AI and with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio and Agents and now Autonomous Agents, we have built an end-to-end system for AI business transformation. With Copilot Studio, organizations can build and connect Microsoft 365 Copilot to Autonomous Agents, which then delegate to Copilot when there is an exception. More than 100,000 organizations from Ensure, Standard Bank, and Thomson Reuters, to Virgin Money and Zurich Insurance have used Copilot Studio to date, up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. More broadly, we are seeing AI drive a fundamental change in the business applications market as customers shift from legacy apps to AI-first business processes. Dynamics 365 continues to take share as organizations like Evron, Heineken, and Lexmark chose our apps over other providers. And monthly active users of Copilot across our CRM and ERP portfolio increased over 60% quarter-over-quarter. Our Dynamics 365 contact center is also winning customers like Curry's, Le Creuset, and RXO as it brings generative AI to every customer engagement channel. And just last week, we added 10 out-of-the-box autonomous agents to Dynamics 365 that helps customers automatically qualify sales leads, track suppliers and work hand-in-hand with service reps to resolve issues. We're also bringing AI to industry-specific workflows. One year in, DAX Copilot is now documenting over 1.3 million physician patient encounters each month at over 500 health care organizations like Baptist Medical Group, Baylor Scott & White, Baltimore Medical Center, Novant Health, and Overlake Medical Center. It is showing faster revenue growth than GitHub Copilot did in this first year. And new features extend DAX beyond notes helping physicians automatically draft referrals after visit instructions and diagnostic evidence. On top of all this AI innovation, Microsoft Teams usage remains at all-time highs as people use it to streamline all their communications. Nearly 75% of our Teams Enterprise customers now buy Premium, Phone, or Rooms. When it comes to Windows, our new class of Copilot+ PCs is winning new customers. They offer best-in-class AI capability, performance, and value. AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm now all support Copilot+ PCs. This quarter, we also introduced new AI experience only available on Copilot+ PCs like Click to Do, which places an interactive overlay over your desktop to suggest next best actions. And as we approach the end of support for Windows 10 a year from now, we are well positioned to transition our customers to Windows 11, ensuring they benefit from enhanced features and security improvements we've introduced over the past few years. Now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. With our Secure Future Initiative, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to address the highest-priority security tasks. We have made significant progress to better protect tenants' identities, networks, and engineering systems, and we have created new processes to ensure security is prioritized at every level of the Company. And we continue to take what we learn and turn it into innovations across our products. Security Copilot, for example, is being used by companies in every industry, including Clifford Chance, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Shell to perform SecOps tasks faster and more accurately. And we are now helping customers protect their AI deployments too. Customers have used Defender or Discover and secured more than 750,000 gen AI app instances and used Purview to audit over one billion Copilot interactions to meet their compliance obligations. And all up, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve and are consistently recognized by top analysts as a leader in 20 categories, more than any other vendor. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Member growth continues to accelerate with markets in India and Brazil both growing at double digits. We are also seeing record engagement as we introduce new ways for our more than 1 billion members to connect, sell services, get hired, and share knowledge. Our investments in rich formats like video strengthened our leadership in B2B advertising and amplified the value we deliver to our customers. Weekly immersive video views increased 6x quarter-over-quarter, and total video viewership on LinkedIn is up 36% year-over-year. Our AI-powered tools also continue to transform how people sell, learn and hire. In sales, new AI features help every team member perform at the level of top sellers and drive more profitable growth. In Learning, just yesterday, we announced updates to our coaching experience, including personalized career development plans. LinkedIn's first agent hiring assistant will help hirers find qualified candidates faster by tackling the most time-consuming task. Already hirers who use AI Assistant messages see a 44% higher acceptance rate compared to those who don't. And our hiring business continues to take share. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With Copilot, we are seeing the first step towards creating a new AI companion for everyone with new Copilot experience we introduced earlier this month includes a refreshed design and tone along with improved speed and fluency across the web and mobile. And it includes advanced capabilities like voice and vision that make it more delightful and useful and feel more natural. You can both browse and converse with Copilot simultaneously because Copilot sees what you see. More broadly, AI is also transforming search, browsers, and digital advertising, and we continue to take share across Bing and Edge. Bing ex-TAC revenue growth outpaced the search market. Now on to gaming. One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger. Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber ads on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens, they spend their time on. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our commercial and consumer businesses. In three weeks' time, we will hold our Ignite conference, and I look forward to sharing more then about how we are helping every business function use AI to drive growth in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $65.6 billion, up 16%, and earnings per share was $3.30, an increase of 10%. With strong execution by our sales teams and partners, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year with double-digit top and bottom-line growth. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30% and 23% in constant currency. Results were driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Additionally, we also saw an increase in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for Azure. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 22% and 21% in constant currency to $259 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 27%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 98%. In addition to commercial results that were in line with expectations, we also saw some benefit from in-period revenue recognition across Microsoft 365 commercial, Azure, and our on-premises server business. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, with a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.05 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party and includes $911 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $38.9 billion and grew 22%, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year to 71%. This was slightly better than expected due to improvement in Azure, although the gross margin percentage decrease year-over-year continues to be driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was 69%, down 2 points year-over-year, driven by the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier as well as the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 12%, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies and ongoing prioritization work. Operating expense growth included 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 8% higher than a year ago. Excluding the growth of the Activision acquisition, headcount was 2% higher. Operating income increased 14% and operating margins were 47%, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the net impact from the Activision acquisition, operating margins were up 1 point as we continue to drive efficiencies across our businesses as we invest in AI infrastructure and capabilities. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $28.3 billion and grew 12% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all businesses. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 15% and 16% in constant currency with business trends that were as expected. The better-than-expected result was due to a small benefit from the in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. ARPU growth was primarily driven by E5 as well as M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial cloud revenue represents nearly 90% of total M365 commercial products and cloud services. M365 commercial products revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. M365 consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, with continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 84.4 million. M365 consumer cloud revenue represents 85% of total M365 consumer products and cloud services. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all lines of business. Dynamics revenue grew 14%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 18% and 19% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and continued share gains. As a reminder, Dynamics 365 represents about 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 16%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.1 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33% and 34% in constant currency, with healthy consumption trends that were in line with expectations. The better-than-expected result was due to the small benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Azure growth included roughly 12 points from AI services, similar to last quarter. Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity. Non-AI growth trends were also in line with expectations in total and across regions as customers continued to migrate and modernize on the Azure platform. The non-AI point contribution to Azure growth was sequentially lower by approximately 1 point. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1%. Lower-than-expected transactional purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2025 launch as well as lower purchasing of licenses running a multi-cloud environment was mostly offset by the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%, and gross margin percentage decreased 3 points year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 8% and operating income grew 18%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue of $13.2 billion increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by gaming and search. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 2% year-over-year as better-than-expected results in Windows OEM due to mix shift to higher monetizing markets was partially offset by the lower-than-expected results in devices due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 18% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to continued execution improvement. We saw rate expansion in addition to healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in gaming, revenue increased 43% and 44% in constant currency with 43 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in both first- and third-party content as well as consoles. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% with 53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Our strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search was offset by sales mix shift to those businesses. Operating expenses increased 49% with 51 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income decreased 4%. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $20 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $14.9 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $34.2 billion, up 12%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $19.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income expense was negative $283 million, significantly more favorable than anticipated due to foreign currency remeasurement and net gains on investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to have no meaningful impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q1 continue through Q2. Customer demand for our differentiated solutions should drive another quarter of strong growth. In commercial bookings, we expect strong growth on a growing expiry base driven by increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis, given our cloud and AI demand signals. As I said last quarter, we will stay aligned and, if needed, adjust to the demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, segment guidance, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We are the market leader when it comes to knowledge-based Copilots and agents in the enterprise space, and we are focused on continuing to gain share across our productivity solutions. Therefore, we expect revenue in Productivity and Business Processes to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or $28.7 billion to $29 billion. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency with moderating seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot. For H2, we expect revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared to Q2. We continue to see growth in M365 Copilot seats, and we expect the related revenue to continue to grow gradually over time. For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include on-premises components of M365 suites. So, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads. Next, Intelligent Cloud. Helping our customers transform and grow with innovative cloud and AI solutions is driving continued growth in Azure. Therefore, we expect revenue in Intelligent Cloud to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency or $25.55 billion to $25.85 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth to be 31% to 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history. We expect the contribution from AI services to be similar to last quarter, given the continued capacity constraints as well as some capacity that shifted out of Q2. And in H2, we still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. And in our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits on a prior year comparable that benefited from purchasing ahead of Windows Server 2012 end of support. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Now to More Personal Computing. We continue to make decisions to prioritize strategic higher-margin opportunities within each of our consumer businesses. Our outlook reflects the improvement in gross and operating margins from this prioritization work across gaming, search, and devices. We expect revenue in More Personal Computing to be $13.85 billion to $14.25 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in line with the PC market to be more than offset by a decline in devices as the trends from Q1 continue. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, with continued growth in both volume and revenue per search. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the high single digits. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits due to hardware. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be relatively flat. We're excited about last week's launch of Call of Duty, where we saw the most Game Pass subscriber adds we've ever seen on a launch day. There are two things about the launch that are different than the Call of Duty launch a year ago, where revenue was mostly recognized in the quarter of purchase. First, the game is available on Game Pass so for players who play through Game Pass, the subscription revenue is recognized over time. Second, the game requires an online connection to play so even for players who purchased the standalone game, revenue recognition will also occur ratably over time. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or to be between $21.9 billion to $22.1 billion, and operating expense to grow approximately 7% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. This should result in another quarter of operating margin expansion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.5 billion, primarily driven by our share of the expected loss from OpenAI, which is accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. As you heard from Satya, our strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI has been pivotal in building and scaling our AI business and positioning us as the leader in the AI platform wave. And lastly, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on strategically investing in the long-term opportunities that we believe drive shareholder value. Monetization from these investments continues to grow, and we're excited that only 2.5 years in, our AI business is on track to surpass $10 billion of annual revenue run rate in Q2. This will be the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. We are committed to growing this leadership position across our entire Microsoft Cloud while maintaining our disciplined focus on cost management and prioritization across every team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Congratulations on a really solid quarter. So, Satya, the expansion of capabilities, the speed of innovation, the magnitude of the opportunities ahead for generative AI makes this the most exciting period for software I've seen in my 25 years of covering this space. And based upon this call, it seems like you share that excitement. But in my investor conversation, that excitement also feeds two related questions, and they both have to do with constraints. And the first is like what are the internal constraints or guardrails that Microsoft has when it comes to investing behind these innovations, particularly in relation to the funding of future generations of foundational models, where people were talking about price tags, you want to spend the tens of billions or even $100 billion-plus? And then on the other side of the spectrum, what are the external constraints that Microsoft sees in building out this capacity to meet the demand and capture the opportunity, particularly constraints in your ability to power all these new data centers being built out and powered in an environmentally sustainable fashion? I'd love to get the Microsoft perspective on both those questions.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for those questions. I think on the first point, ultimately, when you think about, let's say, capital outlay for training because that's essentially what you're asking, it is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference, given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would then project the demand, and that's what we would build for. So, you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you're building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand, right? So ultimately, even with all the scaling laws and what have you, I think you ultimately will normalize to having a pace. In fact, I think the best way to think about even is given that Moore's Law effectively is working on the sort of silicon and system size, so it's just not compute, right, it's efficiencies in compute, it's data as well as algorithms. You will want to sort of keep on that curve, which is you really want to refresh your fleet with the Moore's Law every year and then effectively depreciate it over the period of the life cycle of it. And then the inference demand ultimately will cover how much we invest in training because that's, I think, at the end of the day, you're all subject to ultimately demand. So, the second piece of the external constraints, we have run into, obviously, lots of external constraints because this demand all showed up pretty fast, right? I mean, if you think about even the most hit product of this generation all are in our cloud, right, whether it's ChatGPT, whether it's Copilot, whether it's GitHub Copilot or even DAX Copilot, I mean, pick the top four or five products of this generation, they're all sort of in and around our ecosystem. And so therefore, we ran into a set of constraints, which are everything because DCs don't get built overnight. So, there is DCs, there is power. And so that's sort of been the short-term constraint. Even in Q2, for example, some of the demand issues we have or our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. So that's the constraints we have. But in the long run, we do need effectively power and we need DCs. And some of these things are more long lead. But I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply/demand will match up.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Amy, good to hear the reacceleration in the back half for Azure. I guess many are asking, 34% growth in Q1 falling to low 30s. I know the comp is a couple of points harder, but is there anything else you're contemplating in that guide for Q2 to see that deceleration other than a tougher comp?\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a great question because I can sort of reiterate some of the points I made and tie them together a little bit. In Q1, the 34% in CC, as we talked about, that upside versus the 33% that we had guided to was primarily due to some revenue recognition benefits. And so, I think about that on a sort of a pure consumption basis and AI as being 33%. And you think about 1 point or 2 of decel that we've guided to, and the majority of that is due to, unfortunately, some supply pushouts that I mentioned and then Satya reiterated in terms of AI supply coming online that we counted on. The underlying consumption growth is stable Q1 to Q2. And so, to your question on some ins and outs, it is certainly some ins and outs. I do, as you heard, have confidence as we get a good influx of supply across the second half of the year, particularly on the AI side that we'll be better able to do some supply-demand matching and hence, while we're talking about acceleration in the back half. I'll also take the opportunity to say, when you see usage in AI workloads, we always intend to think about that as just a GPU exercise. The importance of having GPUs and CPUs be able to run these workloads is also important. So that's a piece of the acceleration in H2 as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMark Moerdler: Congratulations on the quarter. The question every investor obviously asks is a question on the CapEx growth and the CapEx spend. Obviously, half of that facility is an equivalent that have a longer life, but the other half is the rest of the components. Can you give any color on how you think of that growth? Does it return to the traditional approach, where basically CapEx is going to grow in line or slightly slower than cloud revenue? And if so, any sense of the timing? Do we have enough facilities online by sometime next year, et cetera? Any color would be appreciated.\nAmy Hood: Thanks, Mark. I think in some ways, it's helpful to go back to the cloud transition that we worked on over a decade ago, I think, in the early stages. And what you did see and you'll see us do in the same time is you have to build to meet demand. Unlike the cloud transition, we're doing it on a global basis in parallel as opposed to sequential, given the nature of the demand. And then as long as we continue to see that demand grow, you're right, the growth in CapEx will slow and the revenue growth will increase. And those two things, to your point, get closer and closer together over time. The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption. And to Satya's point, some of that spend goes towards building the next training infrastructure so you won't see all of it in COGS. Some of it goes to OpEx when you're spending it on training. But in general, that's a healthy way to think about the balance as that over time those do and should like the last cycle get closer together.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: I'm actually not going to ask a question about the numbers, but Satya and Amy, I'd love to ask a question about OpenAI. Since the print three months ago, we investors have been hit with a torrent of media stories about OpenAI and Microsoft. And I'd love to give Microsoft an opportunity to frame the relationship. It seems to me it's critically important. But we have been, I think, everyone on the line picking up signals that perhaps Microsoft wants to diversify somewhat at the model layer and offer customers choice. So, Satya, I'd love to get your framing of the relationship. And then in terms of the numbers, maybe this is a little bit more for you, Amy, but how does Microsoft manage the demands on CapEx from helping OpenAI with its scaling ambitions? And how do you manage the impact on other income that you just gave us some color on?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. Thanks, Karl. So, I'd say first, the partnership for both sides, that's OpenAI and Microsoft, has been super beneficial. After all, we effectively sponsored what is one of the most highest-valued private companies today when we invested in them and really took a bet on them and their innovation four, five years ago. And that has led to great success for Microsoft. That's led to great success for OpenAI. And we continue to build on it, right? So, we serve them with world-class infrastructure on which they do their innovation in terms of models, on top of which we innovate on both the model layer with some of the post-training stuff we do as well as some of the small models we build. And then, of course, all of the product innovation, right? One of the things that my own sort of conviction of OpenAI and what they were doing came about when I started seeing something like GitHub Copilot as a product get built or DAX Copilot get built or M365 Copilot get built. So, we have a fantastic portfolio of innovation that we build on top of that. And the same also, I would say, we are investors. We feel very, very good about sort of our investment stake in OpenAI. And so, our focus, and we're always in constant dialogue with them in a partnership like this where both sides have achieved mutual success at the pace at which we've achieved it, that means we need to kind of push each other to do more, to capture the moment and that's what we plan to do, and we intend to keep building on it.\nAmy Hood: And maybe to your other two questions, Karl, Listen, I'm thrilled with their success and need for supply from Azure and infrastructure and really what it's meant in terms of being able to also serve other customers for us. It's important that we continue to invest capital to meet not only their demand signal and needs for compute but also from our broader customers. That's partially why you've seen us committing the amount of capital we've seen over the past few quarters is our commitment to both grow together and for us to continue to grow the Azure platform for customers beyond them. And so, I don't really think of it as how do you balance it. It's just we have customers who have needs and real use cases and delivering value today. And if we can't meet that, we need to work to meet it. And that means working harder and faster to make sure we do that, which is what the team is committed to do. Second piece of your question, I think, was on the impact to other income. And not to get too accounting-heavy on the earnings phone call, but I would say just a reminder, this is under the equity method, which means we just take our percentage of losses every quarter. And those losses, of course, are capped by the amount of investment we make in total, which we did talk about in the Q this quarter as being $13 billion. And so over time, that's just the constraint and it's a bit of a mechanical entry. And so, I don't really think about managing that. That's the investment and acceleration that OpenAI is making in themselves and we take a percentage of that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Satya, when you talked about the investment cycle, these models are getting bigger, more expensive, but you also pointed out to how the inference phase were likely to get paid. How does that cycle look like an inference for Microsoft? Where are the products and the applications that will show up on the Microsoft P&L as a result of the inference rate of AI kicking in?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Kash. I mean, the good news for us is that we're not waiting for that inference to show up, right? If you sort of think about the point, we even made that this is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it's all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we're not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that's sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference that we are not taking what I would -- in fact, there's a huge adverse selection problem today where people -- it's just a bunch of tech companies still using VC money to buy a bunch of GPUs. We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot. So, I feel the quality of our revenue is also pretty superior in that context. And that's what gives us even the conviction, to even Amy's answers previously, about our capital spend is if this was just all about sort of a bunch of people training large models and that was all we got, then that would be ultimately still waiting, to your point, for someone to actually have demand which is real. And in our case, the good news here is we have a diversified portfolio. We're seeing real demand across all of that portfolio.\nAmy Hood: And Kash, maybe just to add a little bit to what Satya is saying. I think a part of his two answers is that what you're seeing is this number we're talking about, the $10 billion across inference and our apps is already what that momentum and that investment and that progress and that revenue is what builds the next cycle of training, right? And so, it's that circle as opposed to, oh, we're doing training now and then inference. Much of the training investments that are -- that fuel this revenue growth came before and we already funded that work. And so, that's an important part.\nKash Rangan: That's, to your point, that you invest now and you can get the growth later, even if you slow down the CapEx, right, that's what you're trying to tell us?\nAmy Hood: That's the cycle that is important to understand.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: I'm wondering if you can shed any more light just on the nature of the supply limitations that you're mentioning that are impacting Azure in Q2, where that impact might be incrementally just a touch more than we expected? Is it more the GPU supply? Is there some element of power cooling or the ability to wire up the networks? And Amy, should we infer that the supply is constraining Azure growth by roughly a couple of few points in Q2 or am I overestimating that?\nAmy Hood: Maybe to answer both those questions, Mark, very directly, I wouldn't think about it component logic in my Q2 answer. The supply pushout, as Satya said, was third parties that are delivering later than we had expected, that get pushed mainly into the second half of the year and in general, Q3. So that's third parties where we have tended to buy supply inclusive of kits so it's complete end-to-end third-party delivery. In terms of the impact, as I was saying, when you think about having flat consumption Q1 to Q2, there really are only two things that impact that difference and one was the help we got in Q1 from the revenue and accounting help, and then Q2 has been the supply pushout.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: If you talk about the market at the moment because you were first with Copilot, you had identified a lot with Copilots and now we're talking agents. Can you, kind of -- Satya, how do you think about that? And to me, it looks like an evolution that we're discovering how to kind of productize AI better, et cetera. So how do you think about that journey between Copilots, agents and maybe what's coming next?\nSatya Nadella: Sure. The system we have built is Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents and autonomous agents. You should think of that as the spectrum of things, right? So ultimately, the way we think about how this all comes together is you need humans to be able to interface with AI. So, the UI layer for AI is Copilot. You can then use Copilot Studio to extend Copilot. For example, you want to connect it to your CRM system, to your office system, to your HR system. You do that through Copilot Studio by building agents effectively. You also build autonomous agents. So, you can use even that's the announcement we made a couple of weeks ago is you can even use Copilot Studio to build autonomous agents. Now these autonomous agents are working independently, but from time to time, they need to raise an exception, right? So autonomous agents are not fully autonomous because at some point, they need to either notify someone or have someone input something. And when they need to do that, they need a UI layer and that's where again, it's Copilot. So, Copilot, Copilot agents built-in Copilot Studio, autonomous agents built in Copilot Studio, that's the full system we think that comes together, and we feel very, very good about the position. And then, of course, we are taking the underlying system services across that entire stack that I just talked about, making it available in Azure, right? So, you have the raw infrastructure if you want it. You have the model layer independent of it. You have the AI app server in Azure AI, right? So, everything is also a building block service in Azure for you to be able to build. In fact, if you want to build everything that we have built in the Copilot stack, you can build it yourself using the AI platform. So that's sort of, in simple terms, our strategy, and that's kind of how it all comes together.\nBrett Iversen: Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And the last question will come from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed.\nRishi Jaluria: I want to go and think a little bit about Copilot. How we should be thinking about kind of numbers here with the recategorization? It seems like that was maybe softer in the past than expected or maybe with the numbers this quarter starting to pick up. Can you maybe walk us through what you're seeing on that? And maybe more importantly, how we should be thinking about your overall AI strategy on consumer versus enterprise, especially now with the stock on the fold?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. On the first part, Rishi, to your question, I think we feel very, very good about the momentum we have in the commercial Copilot, right? As I said in my remarks and Amy talked about, this is the fastest growth of a new suite in M365. If I compare it to what we saw even way back in E3 or E5 or the transition from O to M, this is really much faster, right? It's the numbers of penetration of the Fortune 500 and then the fact that they're coming back for more seats and what have you. So, it's very strong in that context. The other thing I'd like to mention is that we want this to be something that is systemic, right, because people need to be able to put the security controls, then they need to deploy, then there's skilling and then there's change management. So, this is not like you just -- it's not a tool like when I talk about Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents. It's really as much about a new way to work. And sometimes I describe it as what happened throughout the '90s with PC penetration. After all, if you take a business process like forecasting, what was it like pre e-mail and Excel and post e-mail and Excel, that's the type of change that you see with Copilot. But overall, we feel great about the rate of progress and the penetration. And then on the consumer side, look, for us, the exciting part here is to be able to use the same investment we are making in the commercial where we have structural strength and then beyond the offense. One of the things that I think I hope you all catch in our earnings is ex-TAC, our revenue, when it comes to what we describe as search, news and ads, is growing faster than market. So, it's fantastic to see that. And so that's kind of our consumer business, which in Microsoft's large scope, it's sort of even a $10-plus billion business or sometimes go missing. But in our case, it is actually a fantastic growth business that's growing faster than market. We feel good about how we will use AI in LinkedIn. In fact, LinkedIn is a consumer business as you know. You saw even this week, they announced some new capabilities for both consumers and, in their case, even recruiting. So, we think that AI, the same investment gets monetized even through LinkedIn's innovation. And gaming, of course, is another place where you'll see some of these things apply. And Windows, right? So, the place where I think I'm excited about is Copilot+ PCs. For us, it's not about having a disconnected edge. It's about having hybrid AI where the rebirth of sort of the PC as the edge of AI is going to be one of the most exciting things for developers. So, we feel well positioned, quite frankly, with the same investment. So, this is -- that's the thing. We're not a conglomerate here. We are sort of one company. That means we invest once and then we have all these categories that benefit from that, and that's the theory of the firm for us. And so, we feel good about all of that coming together.\nAmy Hood: And maybe just to add one piece because I think Rishi, now that I'm listening and thinking through the question, it feels like you're wondering like, why am I not seeing the Copilot, if you've made all this progress and the results, and the answer is you already are. In that M365 commercial number, we've seen that seat growth but those seats that we're adding, the majority of them are driven by frontline worker and small businesses. Those have a lower ARPU point. And so, it masks some of the ARPU that we're already seeing not just from E5, which continues to contribute, but also this quarter, additional impact from Copilot. So, as we go forward, being able -- that is where you're going to see the impact will be in ARPU and M365 commercial, as Satya said, I think you'll see the impact of Copilot engagement, frankly, across the same ex-TAC number.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Rishi. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day."}]}
