The Goldman Sachs Q4 2011 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Macroeconomic Concerns**: The call emphasized the challenging macroeconomic environment, particularly the Eurozone crisis and its global implications, which led to increased market volatility and client risk aversion. This environment is expected to continue into 2012, potentially dampening revenue opportunities[3].

2. **Revenue and Earnings**: The firm reported lower revenues and earnings compared to the previous year, primarily due to the difficult macro backdrop. Full-year net revenues were $28.8 billion, down from the previous year, and net earnings were $4.4 billion, also lower than in 2010[3].

3. **Expenses and Cost Cutting**: Goldman Sachs has been focused on reducing expenses, targeting $1.4 billion in savings, most of which was achieved in 2011. This initiative is ongoing, indicating a disciplined approach to managing costs in a challenging environment[3].

4. **Competitive Landscape**: The firm noted some competitive advantages, such as reduced competition from European banks and opportunities from asset sales by troubled institutions. However, overall market conditions remain muted[3].

5. **Capital Management**: Goldman Sachs continues to be cautious about capital allocation, balancing the need for stability with opportunities for share buybacks. The firm's capital ratios, particularly under Basel III, are being closely monitored[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, lower revenue and earnings, and the general risk aversion in the market.
