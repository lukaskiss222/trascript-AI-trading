The Goldman Sachs third-quarter 2012 earnings call revealed several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

- **Revenue and Earnings**: Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $8.4 billion and net earnings of $1.5 billion, with earnings per diluted share of $2.85. While earnings beat expectations, revenue missed, which could lead to short-term market disappointment[4].

- **Client Activity and Market Conditions**: The call highlighted weak corporate client activity and low investor conviction due to economic uncertainties, particularly in Europe and the U.S. This environment has negatively impacted M&A and IPO volumes, and overall market activity[4].

- **Cost Management and Capital Efficiency**: The firm has been aggressive in cost-cutting, with a target of $1.9 billion in expense savings, and has been managing capital levels conservatively, including a focus on optimizing risk-weighted assets under Basel III rules. These efforts are positive for long-term efficiency but may not immediately boost short-term revenue[4].

- **Dividend and Share Buyback**: Goldman Sachs increased its quarterly dividend and has been actively repurchasing shares, which is generally positive for shareholder value but may not offset the immediate impact of revenue misses[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the revenue miss and continued challenging market conditions, despite the company's efforts to manage costs and maintain a strong capital position.
