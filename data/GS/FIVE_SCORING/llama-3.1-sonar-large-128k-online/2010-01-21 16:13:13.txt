The Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2009 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Goldman Sachs reported record net earnings of $13.4 billion for 2009, with a return on common equity of 22.5%. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors[3].

2. **Improved Market Conditions**: The firm benefited from improving market conditions in 2009, including higher asset prices, lower volatility, and improved liquidity. However, the macroeconomic environment remained challenging, which could temper some of the positive sentiment[3/.

3. **Compensation and Expenses**: The compensation to net revenue ratio was significantly lower at 35.8%, which is a record low. This could be seen as a positive move in the current political climate, but it may also indicate lower future compensation levels, potentially affecting morale and retention[3].

4. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The call highlighted significant uncertainty regarding future regulatory changes, particularly the potential impact of the Volcker Rule and other proposals. This uncertainty could introduce volatility in the stock price as investors await clarity on these regulations[3].

5. **Client Activity and Business Outlook**: Client activity showed a seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter but has picked up in the early part of 2010. The firm is optimistic about investment banking and trading activities, particularly if the macroeconomic environment stabilizes[3].

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and improved market conditions are positive indicators.
- Regulatory uncertainty and the potential impact of new regulations could introduce some volatility.
- The lower compensation ratio, while positive in the current political climate, may have mixed implications for future performance.

### Conclusion
The overall strong financial performance and positive market conditions suggest a generally positive outlook, but regulatory uncertainty and potential changes in compensation structures could introduce some caution.
