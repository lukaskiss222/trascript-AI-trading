The Goldman Sachs Q1 2017 earnings transcript reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Mixed Performance**: The quarter saw mixed results, with investment banking performing well but FICC (Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities) client execution being weak due to low volatility and reduced client activity. This mixed performance might lead to some investor uncertainty[5].

2. **Low Volatility Impact**: The low volatility in markets, particularly in commodities and currencies, significantly impacted FICC revenues. If volatility remains low, this could continue to be a headwind for the stock in the short term[5].

3. **Positive Investment Banking**: Strong performance in investment banking, with a 15% increase in net revenues, is a positive sign. However, the pipeline commentary was cautiously optimistic, which might not fully alleviate concerns about immediate growth[5].

4. **Expense Management**: The firm reduced its compensation and benefits expense ratio, which is a positive sign for expense management. However, this might not be enough to offset the negative impact from FICC on its own[5].

5. **Regulatory and Macro Uncertainties**: Uncertainties around Brexit, European elections, and regulatory changes (such as MiFID II and potential revisions to the Volcker Rule) add to the volatility and uncertainty for the stock in the short term[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the underperformance in FICC, despite the strong investment banking results. However, the firm's diversified revenue streams and efficient expense management suggest that the impact may not be severe.
