The Goldman Sachs Q1 earnings call presents a strong performance across various segments, but with some nuanced considerations for short-term implications.

### Key Points:
- **Record Results**: Goldman Sachs reported record net revenues of $12.7 billion, with significant growth in investment banking, trading, and principal investments[3）。
- **Diverse and Robust Performance**: The firm saw strength in FICC, equities, and principal investments, with favorable market conditions and client activity driving these results[3）。
- **Global Growth**: International revenues accounted for approximately 50% of total revenues, indicating strong global growth and a diversified revenue base[3）。
- **Risk Management**: The firm emphasized effective risk management, particularly during recent market volatility, with no significant contagion seen in credit markets from sub-prime issues[3）。
- **Expenses and Hiring**: Expense management was good, and hiring, though challenging, was successful, particularly from campuses and through reputational appeal[3）。

### Short-Term Implications:
Despite the strong performance, there are a few factors that might influence short-term stock price movements:
- **Market Volatility**: Recent market corrections and ongoing volatility could impact investor confidence and trading activity, potentially affecting short-term performance[3].
- **Sub-Prime and Credit Markets**: Although Goldman Sachs has managed sub-prime exposure well, any further deterioration in these markets could still pose risks[3].
- **Regulatory and Accounting Changes**: The adoption of FAS-157 introduced volatility in financial reporting, which might continue to affect quarterly results[3].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong earnings performance, diversified revenue streams, and effective risk management, the short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price is likely to be positive. However, the ongoing market volatility and potential risks in sub-prime and credit markets might temper the immediate upside.
