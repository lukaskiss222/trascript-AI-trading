The Goldman Sachs third-quarter 2009 earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Goldman Sachs reported strong third-quarter results, with net revenues of $12.4 billion, net earnings of $3.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share of $5.25. This robust performance is likely to be positively received by investors.

2. **Market Share and Client Activity**: The firm maintained high market share in FICC and other trading businesses, driven by client activity rather than positioning. This suggests a strong franchise and client relationships, which are positive indicators.

3. **Regulatory and Economic Outlook**: While the regulatory environment is uncertain, Goldman Sachs is well-positioned with robust capital levels and a conservative approach to risk management. However, the firm is cautious about the economic outlook and regulatory changes, which might introduce some volatility.

4. **Compensation and Expenses**: Compensation and benefits expense was high but reflective of the firm's performance. The exact impact of compensation decisions on full-year results is still uncertain and will be finalized at year-end.

5. **Capital and Leverage**: The firm has maintained conservative capital and leverage levels, which are expected to remain so until the regulatory environment clarifies and the economic outlook improves. This prudence could reassure investors.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, maintained market share, and prudent risk management. However, caution around the regulatory and economic environment might temper some of the enthusiasm.
