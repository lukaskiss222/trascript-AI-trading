The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s third-quarter 2014 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $8.4 billion and net earnings of $2.2 billion, with earnings per diluted share of $4.57. This robust performance, especially in Investment Banking and Investing & Lending, is likely to be positively received by investors.

2. **Operational Efficiency and Cost Management**: The firm highlighted significant improvements in operating efficiency and cost management, which contributed to higher pre-tax earnings and a lower compensation-to-net revenues ratio. This indicates effective management and could boost investor confidence.

3. **Regulatory Compliance and Capital Ratios**: Goldman Sachs demonstrated strong compliance with regulatory requirements, including an improved Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). These metrics suggest a stable and well-managed balance sheet, which is positive for investors.

4. **Market Volatility and Client Engagement**: Despite recent market volatility, the firm emphasized its commitment to client service and its ability to navigate challenging market conditions. This stability and client focus are reassuring for investors.

5. **Backlog and Future Outlook**: The investment banking backlog was at its highest level since 2007, and the firm expressed optimism about future market conditions, although they acknowledged the uncertainties surrounding global economic growth.

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, reflecting strong financial performance, efficient operations, and a robust regulatory compliance posture. However, the market's reaction to recent volatility and regulatory changes could introduce some short-term uncertainty.

**Conclusion**:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings, efficient operations, and reassuring regulatory compliance.
