The Goldman Sachs Group's second quarter 2015 earnings call revealed a mixed performance with both positive and challenging aspects. Here are the key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Performance in Some Segments**: Investment Banking and Investment Management showed year-over-year growth, with advisory and equity underwriting revenues increasing significantly. This strength could positively impact investor sentiment.
- **Challenges in FICC**: Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) revenues were down substantially due to reduced client activity and difficult market-making conditions, particularly affected by the Greek debt crisis and macroeconomic shifts. This could pose short-term headwinds.
- **Litigation Charges**: The firm took a significant $1.45 billion charge related to mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which negatively impacted net earnings but is considered a one-time event.
- **Expenses and Capital Management**: Non-compensation expenses were higher due to litigation charges, but core expenses were managed well. The firm also made progress on its Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and maintained a strong capital position.
- **Market Volatility and Client Activity**: The firm experienced healthy volatility in some areas, but the overall environment was impacted by macroeconomic events like the Greek crisis and Chinese market volatility.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some volatility in the short term. However, the underlying strengths in key business segments and the firm's ability to manage expenses and capital effectively suggest that any negative impact from the FICC challenges and litigation charges might be temporary.

**Prediction:**
The stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact due to the mixed results and external macroeconomic challenges, but the overall strong performance in other segments and the firm's diversified business model should mitigate significant downside risk.
