The Goldman Sachs third quarter 2017 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

## Positive Factors
- **Strong Revenue and Earnings**: Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $8.3 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, with a diluted EPS of $5.02, which is a solid performance despite a challenging environment[1][4][5].
- **Diversified Revenue Growth**: The firm saw growth across various segments, including investment banking, investing and lending, and investment management, which helps mitigate risks and ensures a stable revenue stream[1][4].
- **Cost Efficiency and Operating Leverage**: The firm maintained a compensation-to-net revenue ratio of 40%, down 100 basis points from the previous year, indicating effective cost management and operating leverage[1][4].
- **Capital Return**: The firm announced a significant share repurchase authorization of $8.7 billion and a potential dividend increase, which can be attractive to investors[1][4].

## Neutral to Negative Factors
- **FICC Performance**: Despite some sequential improvement, the FICC business remained weak, particularly in commodities, which is a concern given the historical context[1][4].
- **Regulatory Uncertainties**: The firm faces ongoing regulatory challenges, including the evolution of CCAR and potential changes in SLR and GSIB requirements, which could impact capital deployment and growth initiatives[1][4].
- **Market Volatility**: The potential impact of the Fed's unwind of quantitative easing and low client activity in FICC could introduce volatility and affect future performance[1][4].

## Conclusion
Given the strong earnings, diversified revenue growth, and efficient cost management, Goldman Sachs is likely to see a positive impact on its stock price in the short term. However, the ongoing challenges in FICC and regulatory uncertainties might temper some of the enthusiasm.
