The earnings transcript for Goldman Sachs' third quarter of 2013 reveals several key points that are likely to influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Revenue Miss and Client Activity**: Despite beating earnings per share estimates, Goldman Sachs reported lower-than-expected revenues, largely due to reduced client activity in the third quarter. This was attributed to economic uncertainty, seasonal slowdowns, and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown and debt ceiling debates[1][4][5].

2. **FICC Performance**: The Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) business had a particularly tough quarter, with significant declines in revenues across various product areas. However, management emphasized that this was a one-quarter issue rather than a structural problem[4][5].

3. **Compensation and Expenses**: The firm reduced its compensation accrual ratio, which might suggest a more cautious outlook on year-end revenues. Non-compensation expenses were also lower, reflecting cost management efforts[1][4].

4. **Investment Management and I&L**: Positive trends were noted in investment management, with record assets under supervision and strong inflows. The Investing & Lending segment also performed well, driven by gains from private equity investments[1][4].

5. **Regulatory Environment and Capital Management**: Goldman Sachs is navigating the proposed supplementary leverage ratio and other regulatory changes. The firm is focused on adapting to these rules while maintaining strong capital generation and return on equity (ROE)[1][4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the revenue miss, reduced client activity, and the challenging macro-environment. However, the long-term focus on cost management, asset growth, and adaptability to regulatory changes may mitigate some of this pressure.
