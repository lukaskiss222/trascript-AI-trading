The Goldman Sachs Q2 2014 earnings call presents a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Investment Banking and Asset Management**: The firm saw significant growth in M&A activity, debt and equity underwriting, and asset management, which are positive indicators.
2. **Challenges in FICC**: Low volatility and reduced client activity impacted Fixed Income, Commodities, and Currencies (FICC) revenues, a segment that has been historically volatile.
3. **Balance Sheet Optimization**: Goldman Sachs reduced its balance sheet by $56 billion, primarily to comply with regulatory requirements, which could improve capital efficiency but may not immediately boost profitability.
4. **Capital Management**: The firm issued $2 billion in preferred shares and has been active in share buybacks, indicating strong capital management and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The company is proactively managing its balance sheet to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and Basel III, which could add complexity but also ensure long-term stability.

Given these points:

- The strong performance in investment banking and asset management segments is a positive sign.
- However, the challenges in FICC and the ongoing need to manage regulatory compliance could temper near-term enthusiasm.
- The proactive balance sheet optimization and capital management are long-term positives but may not have an immediate impact on stock price.

### Conclusion:

The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term due to the mixed nature of the results. The strong investment banking and asset management performance will likely support the stock, while the FICC challenges and regulatory adjustments may prevent a significant rally.
