The Goldman Sachs Q2 2016 earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Earnings and Cost Management**: Goldman Sachs reported earnings per share of $3.72, beating expectations, and demonstrated effective cost management with $700 million in run-rate savings, although some of these savings will be offset by severance costs in 2016.

2. **Brexit Impact**: The Brexit vote introduced significant market volatility, but Goldman Sachs noted that the market recovery post-Brexit was quicker than anticipated. This suggests that the immediate negative impact might be less severe than feared, although long-term uncertainty remains.

3. **Investment Banking and Market Activities**: Despite challenges, Goldman Sachs saw an increase in investment banking revenues, particularly in debt underwriting, and maintained market share in a competitive environment. The firm's investment management division also reported stable fees and increased assets under supervision.

4. **Capital Management and Share Buybacks**: Goldman Sachs has a strong capital position, with robust ratios and a significant share buyback program. The firm repurchased 11.1 million shares in the quarter, indicating continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings, effective cost management, and robust capital position. However, the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and global economic conditions may slightly temper this positivity.
