The earnings transcript for Goldman Sachs' Q1 2023 highlights several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Performance in Challenging Environment**: Despite volatility and market disruptions, Goldman Sachs delivered solid net revenues of $12.2 billion and earnings per share of $8.79, with a robust ROE of 11.6% and ROTE of 12.6%[3].
- **Market Share and Client Engagement**: The firm maintained its industry-leading positions in Global Banking & Markets, with strong performances in FICC and Equities. They also saw growth in transaction banking and positive trends in Platform Solutions[3].
- **Asset Management Growth**: Asset & Wealth Management revenues rose 24% year-over-year, driven by record management and other fees, and the firm continued to see strong alternative fundraising activity[3].

### Negative Factors
- **Volatility and Market Disruptions**: The quarter was marked by significant market volatility, particularly in March, which impacted certain segments like underwriting and affected overall capital markets activity[3].
- **Consumer Repositioning**: While the firm is narrowing its consumer focus, the process involves selling off non-strategic assets like the Marcus loan portfolio and GreenSky, which could lead to short-term adjustments and potential costs[3].
- **Moderated Buybacks**: The firm plans to moderate buyback activity in the second quarter due to macroeconomic uncertainties, which might be seen as less favorable by investors looking for aggressive capital return[3].

### Conclusion
Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility. However, the overall strength of Goldman Sachs' franchises, its robust financial position, and the resilience shown during market disruptions suggest that the negative impacts are temporary.

### Rating

The stock may see some short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and market uncertainties, but the long-term outlook and the firm's ability to navigate challenging environments suggest a positive impact overall.
