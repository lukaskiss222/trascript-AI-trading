The Goldman Sachs Group's third-quarter 2011 earnings call highlighted several key points that suggest a challenging short-term outlook for the stock:

- **Negative Earnings and Revenue Decline**: The firm reported a net loss of $393 million and a significant decline in net revenues, particularly in Investment Banking and Investing & Lending segments, due to macroeconomic uncertainties and market volatility[5].
- **Macro Economic Concerns**: The global economic environment, especially the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, continued to dampen client activity and asset values, impacting Goldman Sachs' revenue opportunities[5].
- **Increased Risk Aversion**: Clients and the firm itself have become more risk-averse, leading to reduced transaction volumes and lower asset values, which negatively impacted the Investing & Lending business[5].
- **CDS Spreads and Funding Costs**: Despite strong capital and liquidity positions, CDS spreads widened, indicating market concerns that do not align with the firm's internal assessments. This discrepancy could affect market sentiment negatively[5].
- **Share Buybacks**: While the firm is committed to buying back shares due to their perceived undervaluation, the authorization from the Fed is not disclosed, and the blackout period ending soon may influence short-term trading activity[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the negative earnings, reduced client activity, and broader market uncertainties.
