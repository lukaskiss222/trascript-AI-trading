The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s second-quarter 2011 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

## Economic and Market Uncertainties
- The quarter was marked by significant economic and market uncertainties, particularly from Europe, the U.S., and China, which led to reduced client risk appetite and lower activity levels. This environment is expected to continue, potentially affecting future performance.

## Underperformance in FICC
- The Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) segment underperformed due to lower volumes, challenging market conditions, and the firm's decision to reduce risk exposure. This underperformance is not seen as a structural issue but rather a response to the current economic uncertainty.

## Cost Reduction Initiatives
- The firm has targeted $1.2 billion in annual run-rate expense reductions, which includes both compensation and non-compensation expenses. This initiative aims to improve operational efficiency in a challenging economic environment.

## Capital and Liquidity Management
- Goldman Sachs maintains high capital and liquidity ratios, which are expected to continue, especially as the firm prepares for Basel III requirements. The firm is also actively engaged in share repurchases, with a total authorization of approximately 91 million shares.

## Investment Banking and Other Segments
- Despite the challenging environment, Investment Banking performed relatively well, with advisory revenues up 78% from the first quarter. However, other segments like Institutional Client Services and Investing & Lending faced challenges due to market conditions.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Goldman Sachs' stock is likely to be influenced by:

- Continued economic and market uncertainties which could sustain the current cautious investor sentiment.
- The firm's ability to navigate and adapt to these conditions through cost reductions and prudent risk management.
- The positive aspects such as strong capital and liquidity positions, and ongoing share repurchases.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the economic uncertainties and the underperformance in certain segments. However, the firm's proactive measures to reduce costs, maintain strong capital ratios, and continue share repurchases suggest a stable long-term outlook.
