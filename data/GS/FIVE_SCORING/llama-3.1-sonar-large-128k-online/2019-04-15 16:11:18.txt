The Goldman Sachs Q1 2019 earnings call presented a mixed picture but with several positive underlying trends and strategic initiatives. Here are the key points:

## Financial Performance
- Revenues were $8.8 billion, down 13% from the previous year, reflecting a slower start to the year due to muted market activity.
- Net earnings were $2.3 billion, with EPS of $5.71 and a return on common equity of 11.1%.
- Investment Banking revenues were down, but advisory revenues were strong, and the firm maintained its leading position in global M&A and equity underwriting.

## Strategic Initiatives
- Goldman Sachs is undergoing a comprehensive strategic review aimed at strengthening existing businesses, diversifying revenue streams, and operating more efficiently.
- Key initiatives include expanding client coverage in Investment Banking, developing new platforms like Marquee and Marcus, and optimizing funding and capital usage.

## Market and Client Activity
- Despite a slow start to the quarter, client engagement improved significantly in the latter half, and the firm is optimistic about the forward outlook.
- The backlog for IPO activity is robust, and there is a strong desire among corporate clients to execute strategic transactions.

## Efficiency and Cost Optimization
- The firm is focusing on cost and funding efficiencies, aiming to reduce expenses and improve margins. This includes digitizing manual activities, expanding straight-through processing, and optimizing resource allocation.

Given these points, here is the short-term impact on the stock:
