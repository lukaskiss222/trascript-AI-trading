The transcript of Goldman Sachs' third quarter 2015 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Challenging Macro Environment**: The quarter was marked by significant macroeconomic challenges, including the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, falling commodity prices, and uncertainty around U.S. interest rate policy. These factors led to lower client activity and reduced revenues in many of Goldman Sachs' businesses.

2. **Revenue Decline**: Net revenues across many businesses were lower, particularly in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equity underwriting. This decline was attributed to market volatility, reduced client activity, and challenging market-making conditions.

3. **Strong M&A Backlog**: Despite the tough quarter, Goldman Sachs reported a strong M&A backlog, with a positive outlook on corporate confidence and transaction activity. This suggests that the firm is well-positioned for future growth in this segment.

4. **Investment Management and Asset Growth**: The firm saw strong organic net inflows in its Investment Management business, with assets under supervision reaching a record $1.19 trillion. This indicates robust growth in fee-based businesses, which could provide a stable source of revenue.

5. **Capital Management**: Goldman Sachs maintained strong capital ratios and continued to manage risk effectively, with a focus on reducing risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and improving operational efficiency.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price is likely to be negative due to the following reasons:

- The company's revenue declined across several key segments, which could disappoint investors.
- The challenging macroeconomic environment and reduced client activity in FICC and equities underwriting suggest ongoing headwinds.
- However, the strong M&A backlog and growth in Investment Management provide some positive outlook.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the revenue decline and challenging market conditions, despite some positive indicators such as the strong M&A backlog and growth in Investment Management.
