The Goldman Sachs Q4 2019 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Despite a challenging environment, Goldman Sachs reported its highest fourth-quarter net revenues since 2007, with a 23% increase year-over-year. This strong performance, particularly in Global Markets and Asset Management, is a positive indicator[5%.

2. **Litigation Charges and Provisioning**: The company took a significant $1.1 billion litigation charge related to 1MDB, which impacted EPS and ROE. However, this is a one-time event and not reflective of ongoing operations[5%.

3. **Investment in New Initiatives**: Goldman Sachs has made substantial investments in new businesses such as consumer banking, transaction banking, and alternatives. While these investments have reduced returns in the short term, they are expected to enhance long-term profitability[5%.

4. **Operating Environment and Guidance**: The company expressed optimism about the current economic environment, citing improved market conditions, resolution progress on Brexit, and improvements in U.S.-China trade tensions. This optimism, combined with solid corporate and institutional client engagement, suggests a favorable outlook[5%.

5. **Efficiency and Cost Management**: Goldman Sachs aims to improve its efficiency ratio by controlling costs and creating operating leverage. The expectation is that non-compensation expenses will be roughly flat in 2020, which could support better returns as new initiatives gain traction[5%.

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting strong financial performance, strategic investments, and an optimistic outlook on the economic environment. However, the one-time litigation charge and ongoing investment expenses might temper immediate enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, improved market conditions, and the long-term potential of new business initiatives.
