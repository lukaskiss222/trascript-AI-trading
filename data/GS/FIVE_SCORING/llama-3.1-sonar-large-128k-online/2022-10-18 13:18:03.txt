Goldman Sachs' third-quarter 2022 earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Strong Financial Performance
Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Goldman Sachs reported solid results, including net revenues of $11.98 billion and earnings per share of $8.25. The firm also saw strong performance in Consumer & Wealth Management and Global Markets, with record revenues in some segments[1][3].

## Strategic Realignment
The company announced a strategic realignment, integrating its Asset and Wealth Management businesses, as well as its Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses. This move is expected to enhance client service, improve efficiency, and drive growth. However, it may take some time to see the full benefits of this realignment[3].

## Market and Economic Uncertainty
CEO David Solomon emphasized the uncertainty in the global economy, including high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability. These factors are likely to persist and could impact the firm's performance in the short term[3].

## Expense Management
Goldman Sachs is focused on managing expenses, particularly non-compensation expenses, amid inflationary pressures. While there are efforts to mitigate expense growth, the current environment may still pose challenges to achieving the firm's efficiency targets in the short term[3].

## Capital Markets and M&A Outlook
The firm expects a cautious and potentially volatile capital markets and M&A environment in 2023 due to economic uncertainty. This could impact the timing and scale of deal and financing-related activities[3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility due to the mixed signals from the earnings report. However, the strong financial performance and strategic initiatives suggest a positive long-term outlook.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, considering the firm's solid financial performance and strategic realignment, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.
