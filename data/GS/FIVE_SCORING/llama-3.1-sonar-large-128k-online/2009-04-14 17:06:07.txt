The Goldman Sachs Q1 2009 earnings call presents several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Goldman Sachs reported solid results with net revenues of $9.4 billion, net earnings of $1.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share of $3.39, significantly beating analyst estimates. This strong performance is likely to positively impact the stock in the short term[3 ).

2. **Record FICC Revenues**: The Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) business posted record quarterly revenues, driven by favorable competitive dynamics, wider margins, and higher volatility. This is a significant positive factor[3].

3. **Risk Management and Capital Position**: Goldman Sachs has maintained robust capital ratios (Tier 1 ratio of 16% under Basel II) and record levels of liquidity ($164 billion), which enhance its financial profile and ability to navigate current conditions. This adds to investor confidence[3].

4. **TARP Repayment Plans**: The company's intention to use private capital to redeem TARP funds, pending the results of the stress assessment, indicates a move towards reducing government involvement and could be seen positively by investors[3].

5. **Cautious Outlook**: Despite positive results, management remains cautious about the near-term economic outlook, which might temper some of the enthusiasm. However, the overall tone suggests resilience and adaptability in challenging conditions[3].

Given these points, the strong financial performance, record FICC revenues, robust capital and liquidity positions, and plans to repay TARP funds are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
