The transcript of Goldman Sachs' Q1 2013 earnings call provides several key points that can influence the short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price:

1. **Mixed Client Activity**: Client activity was strong early in the quarter but slowed down due to macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in Europe and the U.S. This mixed performance could lead to cautious investor sentiment.

2. **Revenue Performance**: While Goldman Sachs reported solid results, with net revenues of $10.1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $4.29, the FICC (Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities) revenues were down year-over-year, which might be a concern for some investors.

3. **Regulatory Environment**: The ongoing regulatory changes, including the Volcker Rule and derivatives reform, introduce uncertainty. However, Goldman Sachs' ability to adapt to these changes and their commitment to quality rule-making could be seen positively by investors.

4. **Expense Management and Capital Usage**: The firm demonstrated strong expense discipline, reducing compensation and benefits expenses and maintaining a conservative approach to capital management. This could be viewed favorably by investors looking for operational efficiency.

5. **Market Sentiment**: The overall market sentiment during the quarter was positive, with improvements in housing and unemployment data, but was tempered by late-quarter macroeconomic uncertainties. This balance could influence investor decisions in the short term.

Given these points, the stock might experience a neutral to slightly positive reaction in the short term. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

- The solid financial performance and strong expense management are positives.
- The mixed client activity and regulatory uncertainties introduce some caution.
- The overall market environment and Goldman Sachs' adaptability to regulatory changes could mitigate some of the negative impacts.
