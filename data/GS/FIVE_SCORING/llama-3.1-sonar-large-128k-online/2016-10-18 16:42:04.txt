The Goldman Sachs Group's Q3 2016 earnings call presented a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: The firm reported a 19% year-over-year increase in revenues and a strong earnings per share of $4.88, indicating a recovery from the challenging first half of the year[5|.
2. **Market Share and Client Sentiment**: Goldman Sachs has seen improvements in client sentiment and market share gains, particularly in areas like investment banking and fixed income, citing robust advisory and debt underwriting activities[5|.
3. **Expense Management**: The company has maintained a strong focus on expense discipline, with a decline in compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses, contributing to operating leverage[5|.
4. **Capital Management**: Goldman Sachs has strengthened its capital ratios and has the flexibility to manage share repurchases and investments dynamically, depending on the economic environment[5|.
5. **New Initiatives**: The launch of the Marcus online lending platform and other technological initiatives are seen as positive steps, though their immediate impact may be limited[5|.
6. **Macro Environment**: Despite a favorable third quarter, the overall macro environment remains challenging with low growth and low interest rates, which could continue to affect performance in the short term[5!.

Given these points, here is the conclusion:

- The positive revenue growth, strong earnings, and improved client sentiment are likely to support the stock in the short term.
- However, the ongoing challenges in the macro environment and the slow pace of some new initiatives may temper some of the enthusiasm.
- The company's strong capital position and expense management also bode well for long-term stability.
