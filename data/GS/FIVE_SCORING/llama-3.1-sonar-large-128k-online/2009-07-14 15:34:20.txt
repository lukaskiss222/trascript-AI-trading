The transcript for Goldman Sachs' second quarter 2009 earnings call presents several key points that can influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Goldman Sachs reported strong second quarter results, with net revenues of $13.8 billion and net earnings of $3.4 billion. This performance was driven by robust results in FICC and equities trading, as well as strong equity underwriting activity.
  
- **Conservative Risk Management**: The company maintained high levels of capital and liquidity, reflecting a cautious outlook on the economic environment. This conservative approach is likely to be viewed positively by investors.

- **Challenges and Headwinds**: Despite the strong performance, the company faced headwinds in areas such as M&A advisory, security services, and commercial real estate. These challenges, coupled with uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook, could temper some of the positive sentiment.

- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The potential impact of new capital regulations and changes in the regulatory environment could introduce uncertainty, affecting investment decisions and potentially influencing the stock price.

Given these points, the strong financial performance and conservative risk management are likely to be viewed positively by investors, but the ongoing challenges and regulatory uncertainties may prevent a significant rally. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact but not a great one.
