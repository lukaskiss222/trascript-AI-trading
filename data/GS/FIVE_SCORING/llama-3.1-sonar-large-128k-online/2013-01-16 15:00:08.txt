The Goldman Sachs Q4 2012 earnings call presented a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Mixed Performance**: Despite a challenging environment, Goldman Sachs reported net earnings of $2.9 billion and earnings per diluted share of $5.60, which is positive. However, the overall return on equity (ROE) of 10.7% for the year is lower than historical norms, and the firm cautioned about ongoing market uncertainties.

2. **Expense Management and Compensation**: The firm managed to reduce its compensation-to-net-revenues ratio, which is a positive sign for shareholders. However, this was partly due to disciplined expense management and a competitive environment that may not be sustainable in the long term.

3. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The call highlighted ongoing regulatory uncertainty, particularly around Basel III, Volcker Rule, and other global regulations. This uncertainty could continue to impact the firm's ability to provide clear guidance on future performance and capital deployment.

4. **Client Activity and Market Conditions**: The firm noted that client activity remains cautious due to economic and political uncertainties, which could impact future revenue growth. However, there are signs of improvement in some market conditions, such as tighter credit spreads and higher equity prices.

5. **Capital and Liquidity**: Goldman Sachs maintained a strong liquidity position and conservative capital levels, which is a positive sign but also indicates a cautious approach to deploying capital in uncertain markets.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility but may not see significant positive movement due to the cautious outlook and ongoing regulatory uncertainties.
