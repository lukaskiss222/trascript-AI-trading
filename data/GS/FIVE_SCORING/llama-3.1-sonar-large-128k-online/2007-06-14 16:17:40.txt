Based on the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Q3 2024 earnings call transcript, here are the key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $12.7 billion and earnings per share of $8.40, with an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11.1%, indicating solid financial performance despite some challenges[1][5].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company expressed confidence in its strategy and client franchise, highlighting growth in durable revenue streams and a strong pipeline of opportunities. However, there was a mention of moderating buybacks due to higher than expected SCB requirements, which might slightly dampen shareholder return expectations in the short term[5].
- **Dividend Increase**: The board approved a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $3 per share, which is a positive signal to shareholders and indicates the company's confidence in its financial strength[5].
- **Challenges and Adjustments**: The narrowing of the consumer footprint and selected items impacted the ROE, but management's tone remained positive about the overall performance and future prospects[1].

Given these points, the strong financial performance, dividend increase, and confident management tone are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term, despite some minor adjustments.
