The Goldman Sachs third quarter 2008 earnings transcript reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Challenging Market Environment**: The company faced significant challenges in the third quarter, including declining market values, reduced client activity, and higher volatility. Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs maintained profitability and a strong franchise, which is a positive sign[5].

2. **Risk Management and Liquidity**: Goldman Sachs emphasized its disciplined risk management approach, including daily marking of assets to market, reduction of concentrated exposures, and maintenance of high liquidity levels. These measures have helped the firm navigate the difficult market conditions and should continue to support investor confidence[5].

3. **Financial Performance**: Net revenues were $6 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $1.81, which, although lower than previous quarters, indicate the firm's ability to perform in a challenging environment. The investment banking backlog increased, and asset management and securities services produced strong results[5].

4. **Counterparty Risk and Funding**: The firm addressed concerns about counterparty risk, especially in light of the Lehman and AIG situations, and assured that their risk management strategies, including hedging and daily margining, have minimized the direct impact of these events on their results[5].

5. **Market Sentiment**: The transcript indicates a cautious but optimistic tone from management. David Viniar emphasized that while the current environment is difficult, the firm is well-positioned to manage risks and capitalize on future opportunities. This balanced perspective could help stabilize investor sentiment[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's robust risk management, strong financial performance despite challenging conditions, and management's confident outlook should help maintain or slightly boost investor confidence.
