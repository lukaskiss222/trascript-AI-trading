Goldman Sachs' Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted several key points that suggest a mixed outlook for the short term. Here are the main factors to consider:

1. **Challenging Macro Environment**: The call emphasized the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in Europe and the broader global economy, which have negatively impacted client activity and market volumes. This environment is likely to continue affecting the stock in the short term.

2. **Revenue and Earnings**: Net revenues were $6.6 billion, with a return on common equity of 5.4%, which is below historical norms. This subpar performance could weigh on investor sentiment.

3. **Expense Management and Cost Savings**: The company is actively managing expenses, targeting additional cost savings of $500 million by year-end. While this is positive for long-term efficiency, it may not immediately boost short-term performance.

4. **Share Repurchases**: Goldman Sachs repurchased $1.5 billion worth of shares, which is a positive signal but may not be enough to offset broader market concerns.

5. **Business Performance**: Investment Banking and Institutional Client Services saw declines due to macro concerns, although there were some bright spots such as the mortgage business. However, these segments are highly dependent on market conditions.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Goldman Sachs' stock is likely to be negatively impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, reduced client activity, and lower-than-expected earnings. However, the company's efforts in cost management and shareholder-friendly actions like share repurchases provide some underlying support.
