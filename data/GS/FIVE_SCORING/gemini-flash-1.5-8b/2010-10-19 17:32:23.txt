Goldman Sachs' Q3 2010 earnings show a mixed picture.  While investment banking revenues were up, trading results were slightly down, reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty and slower client activity.  The company's robust capital position and significant liquidity are highlighted as key factors in managing potential Basel III impacts.  The management's tone emphasizes the importance of adapting to changing regulatory environment and emphasizes client satisfaction as a vital factor for long-term success; the lack of concrete plans for share buybacks in the short to medium term should be a negative factor for the stock.
