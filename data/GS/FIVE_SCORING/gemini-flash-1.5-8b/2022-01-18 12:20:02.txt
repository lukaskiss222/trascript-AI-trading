While the Global Markets segment showed a slight sequential decline in the fourth quarter amidst a less active market-making environment, management highlights continued client growth and a strong pipeline, suggesting resilience in the face of potential market volatility.  The firm's commitment to its strategic plan and investments in technology and personnel suggests a focus on long-term growth and durability.
