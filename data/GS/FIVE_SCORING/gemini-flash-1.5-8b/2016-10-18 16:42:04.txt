Goldman Sachs' Q3 2016 earnings showed a generally positive trend, with revenue growth and steady improvement compared to prior quarters.  However, investment banking revenues declined sequentially, indicating a potentially slower pace of M&A activity. Management highlighted strong client engagement and operational efficiency, suggesting continued market share gains and cost management despite a quieter quarter. The launch of Marcus, their consumer lending platform, is anticipated to add value in the long term.
