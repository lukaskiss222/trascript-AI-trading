Goldman Sachs reported strong Q3 2006 earnings, exceeding expectations in a challenging market.  While investment banking and trading revenues were down sequentially, the consistently high level of client dialogue and robust activity in investment banking suggest a healthy pipeline, despite market volatility.  Management's cautious optimism about the medium-to-long-term outlook, coupled with continued share repurchases, could lead to a positive stock price reaction as investors focus on the firm's resilient performance compared to its peers in a less-than-stellar environment.
