Goldman Sachs' Q4 2013 earnings transcript indicates continued strong performance, particularly in investment banking, driven by a robust IPO market and higher M&A activity.  Management highlighted the gradual economic improvement but emphasized that the environment is not yet fully normalized, citing issues like central bank policies and political uncertainties as lingering factors.  The outlook suggests continued growth in investment banking, but the impact of regulatory changes remain a crucial factor in the company's long-term outlook.
