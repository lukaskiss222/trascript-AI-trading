Goldman Sachs' Q1 2012 earnings show strong performance, driven by improved market conditions in Capital Markets.  Management highlights a significant rebound in revenues, particularly in Investment Banking and Institutional Client Services, as macroeconomic uncertainty lessened. The subdued M&A activity and muted equity volumes, though, suggest some caution.  Overall, a positive short-term outlook with continued improvement but tempered optimism in the near future.
