Goldman Sachs' Q1 2008 earnings call reflects a highly challenging market environment.  Significant losses across various asset classes, particularly in investment banking and principal trading, are attributed to unprecedented market volatility and asset price declines.  While the firm remains profitable overall in 2008, the tone of the call suggests cautious optimism for the near-term, with management emphasizing a strong balance sheet and strategic focus on maintaining client relationships.
