Goldman Sachs' Q3 2014 earnings show strong performance across various segments, particularly in Investment Banking with record M&A advisory activity.  However, the call highlights some headwinds, notably the 18% sequential decline in overall Investment Banking revenues and reduced activity in equity underwriting.  Management emphasizes the firm's long-term strategy and resilience despite short-term market fluctuations.
