Goldman Sachs reported strong Q2 2018 earnings, exceeding expectations across several segments, particularly in Investment Banking with record M&A volumes and equity underwriting.  Management expressed confidence in the current economic environment, highlighting robust client activity and a healthy pipeline.  However, some segments like Institutional Client Services and Equities saw lower sequential revenue, potentially due to market volume fluctuations.  The companyâ€™s guidance and investor relations commentary suggest an optimistic outlook over the next weeks.
