Goldman Sachs' earnings call, while reporting solid adjusted return on common equity (13.1%), indicated a significant slowdown in client activity across Investment Banking and FICC, primarily due to macro concerns and a generally cautious investor sentiment during Q4 2010.  The company has emphasized that the decline in activity may be temporary and expects a continuation of staff growth (mid-to-high single digits) and continued investment in growth areas, particularly in Investment Management. Despite regulatory headwinds, management remains optimistic long-term given the firm's fundamental client relationships and investment in the global marketplace.
