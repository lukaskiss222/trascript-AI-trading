Goldman Sachs' Q2 2016 earnings show a mixed picture.  While investment banking revenues saw strong sequential growth, the Brexit vote significantly impacted client sentiment and activity levels, leading to a short-term slowdown, especially in advisory.  Management expressed confidence in the long-term, highlighting continued investments in digital platforms and client service.  Thus, the immediate outlook for Goldman stock depends on the global economic response to Brexit and the ongoing uncertainty.
