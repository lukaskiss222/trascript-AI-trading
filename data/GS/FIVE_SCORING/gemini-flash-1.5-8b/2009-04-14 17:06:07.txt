Goldman Sachs' Q1 2009 earnings show resilience in the face of a challenging market, particularly in their FICC division.

Management's cautious outlook, focus on liquidity, and continued commitment to client service suggest short-term stability and long-term potential for the company, despite the ongoing economic uncertainty.
