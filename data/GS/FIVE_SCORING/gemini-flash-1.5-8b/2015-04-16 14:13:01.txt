Goldman Sachs' Q1 2015 earnings were strong, driven by a significant increase in Investment Banking advisory revenue and a rebound in trading activity, particularly in equities and derivatives, benefitting from increased market volatility and client activity.  Management highlighted the positive impact of central bank policies, particularly the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program.  The company's focus on client needs and operating efficiency contributed to improved profitability compared to the previous year, and they expect continued demand for their services.
