Goldman Sachs reported record earnings driven by strong performance across all business segments, particularly Investment Banking.  Management highlighted a strong backlog, favorable market conditions, and a focus on global expansion.  While the call notes potential headwinds in some sectors (e.g., subprime mortgages), the overall tone is positive and suggests continued strong performance in the short-term.
