Goldman Sachs' Q1 2011 earnings show strong Institutional Client Services (ICS) performance, driven by increased client activity across FICC and equities.  Investment Banking revenues were down, but advisory and underwriting showed growth in specific areas like debt.  The management team emphasized cautious client behavior and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, suggesting the near-term outlook might be subdued.
