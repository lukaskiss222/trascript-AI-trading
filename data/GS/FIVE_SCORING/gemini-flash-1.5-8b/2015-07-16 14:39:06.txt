Goldman Sachs' Q2 2015 earnings show strong performance in Investment Banking and Investment Management, offset by headwinds in Institutional Client Services and Investing & Lending.  The key takeaway for the next 1-2 weeks is likely to be the mixed reactions from the market, with the potential for some short-term volatility spurred by discussions around G-SIB surcharges, and ongoing concern impacting the FICC business. The significant litigation charges and the comments on potential repricing in various businesses will also likely influence near-term investor sentiment.
