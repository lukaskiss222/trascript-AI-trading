Goldman Sachs reported strong Q2 2008 earnings, exceeding expectations despite a challenging market.  Significant growth in investment banking, particularly in advisory and equity underwriting, offset weakness in debt underwriting and trading revenues.  However, the company noted volatile market conditions and cautious management commentary regarding the near-term outlook.  Given the cautious tone and reduced backlog, especially in M&A, the stock is likely to experience a slight dip in the short term.
