Goldman Sachs' Q1 2021 earnings call highlighted record revenue and earnings, driven by strong client activity across all segments.  Management emphasized the resilience of the firm's franchise and a strong outlook for the year, despite acknowledging near-term market volatility and risks related to inflation.   The call signals a positive short-term outlook for the stock, with continued strong performance expected, but possibly at a slightly moderated pace compared to Q1.
