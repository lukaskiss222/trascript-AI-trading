Goldman Sachs' Q4 2022 earnings were disappointing, significantly below expectations.  Management cited a challenging operating environment, including muted underwriting volumes, lower FICC and equity activity, and higher loan loss provisions.  While the firm took proactive steps to reduce expenses and balance sheet density, the short-term outlook remains uncertain, particularly for investment banking. The stock is likely to see modest negative pressure over the next few weeks while investors await further clarification from the firm's investor day.
