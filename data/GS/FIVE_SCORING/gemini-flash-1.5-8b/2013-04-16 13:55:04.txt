Goldman Sachs' Q1 2013 earnings show mixed client activity, with strong performance initially impacted by later-quarter uncertainty in Europe and the US.  While investment banking revenues were up, advisory revenue was down slightly, and management attributed this to client caution amidst macro uncertainty.  The call suggests a short-term impact on the stock, given the focus on managing risk and uncertainty rather than a strong push for growth.
