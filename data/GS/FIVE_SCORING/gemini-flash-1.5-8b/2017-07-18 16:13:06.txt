Goldman Sachs' Q2 2017 earnings show strong performance in equities, investment management, and certain parts of the investment banking division, offset by a weak FICC segment.  The management team attributes these differences to client activity levels and market volatility, indicating that the weak FICC performance might be less structural and cyclical, but suggests the firm needs to adapt to changing market conditions.  The call implies potential for future gains in certain areas, but short-term weakness in FICC will likely present a moderate negative impact over the next 1-2 weeks.
