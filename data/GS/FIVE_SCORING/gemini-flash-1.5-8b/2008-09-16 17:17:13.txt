Goldman Sachs' earnings call highlights significant market headwinds but emphasizes a resilient business model.  While revenue declined across many sectors, management stressed the firm's proactive risk management,  aggressive asset sales, and the strength of its diversified business.  The Fed's actions were viewed as a positive mitigating factor for liquidity risk, suggesting a potentially less severe impact on the stock in the short term.
