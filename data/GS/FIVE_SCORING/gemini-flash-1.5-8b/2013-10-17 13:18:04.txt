Goldman Sachs' Q3 2013 earnings revealed a challenging environment for FICC, driven by lower client activity and seasonal slowdowns.  While investment banking backlog is at a five-year high,  the overall performance did not meet expectations, particularly in equity and debt underwriting.  Management, however, stresses ongoing client relationships, emphasizing long-term value creation and conservative capital management, suggesting a focus on risk mitigation rather than a major shift in business strategy in the short term.
