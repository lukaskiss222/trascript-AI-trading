Goldman Sachs' Q3 2021 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations across multiple segments.  Management highlighted successful execution of their growth strategy, particularly in Investment Banking and Asset Management, driven by increased market share and client activity.  The acquisitions of GreenSky and NN Investment Partners are expected to further bolster recurring revenue and long-term returns.  However, management noted emerging uncertainties with inflation, the Delta variant, and political debate, which could pose a headwind to future growth.
