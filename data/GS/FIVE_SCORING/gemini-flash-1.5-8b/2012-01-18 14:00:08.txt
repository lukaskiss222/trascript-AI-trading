While the firm showed sequential improvement in Investment Banking, driven by a stronger Q4, the overall results reflected the challenging macroeconomic environment, lower client activity, and increased risk aversion. Management acknowledged ongoing macro concerns and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the European financial situation.  Despite this, the firm's focus on managing expenses and maintaining its strong franchise hints at the possibility of continued resilience.
