Goldman Sachs' Q1 2016 earnings were significantly impacted by a challenging global economic environment, with renewed recessionary concerns and volatile market conditions.  Lower equity underwriting volumes, a decline in M&A activity, and muted client activity across FICC segments contributed to the weaker-than-expected results.  While the firm's cost-cutting measures and capital management are viewed positively, the overall negative market sentiment and its impact on client activity likely will continue to be factors in the next 1-2 weeks, possibly leading to further short-term pressure on the stock price.
