Goldman Sachs' Q1 2017 earnings showed mixed results.  While investment banking performed well, exceeding fourth-quarter results,  the institutional client services segment (FICC and equities) experienced lower activity due to low market volatility.  Management emphasized a recalibration period in response to market uncertainty and described plans to maintain profitability and pursue further capital return strategies despite the dip in FICC and equities.
