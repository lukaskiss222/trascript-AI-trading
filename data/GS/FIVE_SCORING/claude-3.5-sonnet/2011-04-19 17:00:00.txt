Based on the earnings transcript, I would give Goldman Sachs a rating of 1 (Positive impact) for the following reasons:

While not stellar, Goldman Sachs delivered solid Q1 2011 results with net revenues of $11.9B and net earnings of $2.7B. Key positives include:

1. Broad-based improvement in FICC (Fixed Income) client execution revenues, which more than doubled sequentially with balanced contributions across products.

2. Investment banking backlog increased from year-end levels, particularly in underwriting.

3. The company maintained strong capital ratios and liquidity while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks.

However, some caution is warranted due to:
- Still subdued overall client activity levels
- Macro uncertainties weighing on business 
- Low ROE of 12.2% compared to historical levels

On balance, the results and management commentary suggest modestly positive momentum that should support the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks, though not a dramatic rally.
