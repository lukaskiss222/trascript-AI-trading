Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a mildly negative short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price. While management demonstrated strong risk management and liquidity practices, several concerning factors emerged:

1. Significant write-downs in mortgages and leveraged loans
2. Continued client deleveraging and reduced activity levels
3. Challenging market conditions impacting multiple business segments
4. Lower investment banking revenues and trading results

However, the company maintained strong capital ratios and liquidity positions, with management expressing confidence in their business model and ability to capitalize on future opportunities. The measured tone and focus on risk management suggests they are well-positioned to weather the crisis, but near-term headwinds remain significant.
