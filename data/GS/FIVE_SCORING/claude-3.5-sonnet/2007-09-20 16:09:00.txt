Based on the transcript, Goldman Sachs delivered exceptionally strong Q3 results despite challenging market conditions. Key positives include:

1. Record or near-record revenues across multiple businesses, including Investment Banking, FICC, and Equities
2. Strong risk management demonstrated by profitable net short position in mortgages while competitors struggled
3. Continued growth in international revenues (53% of total) and diversified revenue streams
4. Management displayed confidence in marks and valuation processes

While there were some negatives like leveraged loan writedowns ($1.7B) and declining investment banking backlog, the firm's overall performance and positioning remains extremely strong. Management's tone was confident and they appear well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities.
