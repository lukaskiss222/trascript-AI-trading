Based on the earnings call transcript, Goldman Sachs delivered strong Q4 and full-year 2009 results, with several positive indicators:

- Record full-year net earnings of $13.4 billion and 22.5% ROE
- Strong capital position with 15% Tier 1 ratio
- Increasing investment banking backlog
- Early signs of improved client activity in 2010
- Conservative risk management and liquidity position
- Strong market share across key businesses

However, there are some near-term headwinds:
- Regulatory uncertainty with new proposals around proprietary trading
- Political/public scrutiny on compensation
- Commercial real estate exposure still facing pressure
- Market spreads likely to normalize

Overall, given the company's strong competitive position, capital base, and early positive trends in 2010, the stock is likely to see positive momentum over the next 1-2 weeks despite regulatory uncertainty.
