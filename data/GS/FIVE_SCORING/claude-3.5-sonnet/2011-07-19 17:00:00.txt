Based on the earnings call transcript, I predict a negative short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price for the following reasons:

1. Significant underperformance in FICC trading revenues compared to peers (down much more than the typical 20-25% quarterly decline seen at other banks), with management acknowledging they "underperformed" during the quarter.

2. Announcement of $1.2 billion in cost cuts and approximately 1,000 job reductions, suggesting management sees ongoing revenue pressure. 

3. Return on Equity of only 8% for first half (10% excluding one-time items), with management indicating 20% ROE target will be "very tough" to achieve in current environment.

4. Continued uncertainty around European exposure and US debt ceiling issues creating challenging trading conditions.

While management noted slightly better conditions in early Q3, the overall tone was cautious and defensive, suggesting continued near-term headwinds for the business and stock price.
