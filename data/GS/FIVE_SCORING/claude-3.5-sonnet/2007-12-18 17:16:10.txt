Based on the earnings transcript, Goldman Sachs delivered strong Q4 and full-year 2007 results with record revenues and earnings, despite challenging market conditions. Key positives include:

1. Record full-year revenues ($46B) and earnings ($11.6B)
2. Strong performance across multiple business segments
3. Geographic diversification helping offset US weakness
4. Relatively limited exposure to mortgage/CDO issues
5. Healthy capital position and continued share buybacks

However, management noted some caution regarding the near-term outlook due to:
- Lower client activity levels, especially in November
- Market volatility and reduced liquidity
- Potential slowdown in investment banking deals
- Uncertain economic environment

While there are some headwinds, Goldman's diversified business model, strong risk management, and global footprint position it well to navigate challenges. The cautious but confident tone from management suggests the stock should perform relatively well in the near-term.
