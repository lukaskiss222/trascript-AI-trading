Based on the earnings call transcript, Goldman Sachs delivered solid results in a challenging environment, with ROE near 11% and effective expense management. Key positives include increased capital ratios, strong client flows, and market share gains in investment banking. Management expressed cautious optimism about growth opportunities while maintaining conservative capital and liquidity positions. The backlog increase and early 2013 client activity trends suggest positive momentum. While regulatory uncertainty remains, the firm appears well-positioned to benefit from competitor retrenchment and improving markets. The disciplined approach to expenses and capital management should support returns in the near term.
