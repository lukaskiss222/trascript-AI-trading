Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a mildly positive short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

1. Strong liquidity position emphasized repeatedly by CFO, with global core excess at record levels and well-managed repo exposure
2. Solid performance in core trading businesses (rates, currencies, commodities) despite market turbulence
3. Proactive management of risk exposures including significant reduction in leveraged loan exposure

However, some concerns exist:
- Continued write-downs in mortgages and leveraged loans
- Asset management outflows in equities
- Generally challenging market environment acknowledged

The firm demonstrated resilience and risk management strength while maintaining profitability in a difficult quarter, which should provide some comfort to investors in the near term.
