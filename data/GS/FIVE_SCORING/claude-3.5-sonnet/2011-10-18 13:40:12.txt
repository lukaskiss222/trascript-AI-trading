Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Goldman Sachs' stock price. Key concerns include: a quarterly loss driven by significant markdowns in the Investing & Lending segment ($2.5B negative revenue), continued market uncertainty particularly around European exposures, and cautious commentary from management about near-term business conditions. While management expressed confidence in long-term prospects and continued share buybacks, the immediate headwinds and challenging operating environment suggest stock pressure in the coming weeks.
