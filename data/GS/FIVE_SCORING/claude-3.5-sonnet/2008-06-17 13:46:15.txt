Based on the transcript, Goldman Sachs delivered relatively strong Q2 2008 results despite the challenging environment. Key positives include:

1. Strong investment banking revenues up 44% QoQ
2. Solid revenue diversity across businesses
3. Reduction in risky assets and strengthened capital position (Tier 1 ratio of 10.8%)
4. Proactive risk management and balance sheet deleveraging

However, there are some concerns:
1. Declining investment banking backlog
2. Weakness in credit/leveraged lending with $775M in losses
3. Reduced share buybacks indicating cautious capital management
4. Continued market uncertainty ahead

Given Goldman's strong execution, risk management and capital position during a difficult period, combined with management's balanced but cautiously optimistic tone, the earnings should have a modestly positive short-term impact on the stock.
