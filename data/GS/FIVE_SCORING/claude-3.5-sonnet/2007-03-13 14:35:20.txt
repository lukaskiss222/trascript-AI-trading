Based on the earnings transcript, Goldman Sachs delivered an exceptionally strong quarter with record revenues of $12.7B and earnings of $3.2B. Key positives include:

1. Strong performance across all major business segments (Investment Banking, Trading, Asset Management)
2. Growing international revenues (now 50% of total)
3. Record investment banking backlog since 2000
4. Robust client activity and market opportunities
5. Management's confident tone about global growth opportunities

While management acknowledged some market uncertainty following February's correction, they emphasized that fundamental business drivers remain intact (global growth, low rates, tight spreads). The firm's diversified business model and strong client franchise position it well to continue performing.
