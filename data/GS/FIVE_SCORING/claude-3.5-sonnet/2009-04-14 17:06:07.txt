Based on the transcript, I would give this a positive rating. Key points supporting a positive short-term stock impact:

1. Record FICC trading revenue of $6.6B driven by broad-based strength across multiple products, with management indicating the performance was not due to reversals of prior losses.

2. Strong capital position with Tier 1 ratio of 16% under Basel II and robust liquidity pool of $164B, positioning the firm well both defensively and for opportunities.

3. Clear intention and ability to repay TARP funds once permitted, which would remove government restrictions.

While there are some headwinds (lower investment banking activity, continued real estate losses), the core trading businesses are performing exceptionally well and the firm maintains significant financial strength. The positive momentum in trading and improved competitive position should support the stock in the near-term.
