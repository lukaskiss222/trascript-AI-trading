Goldman Sachs' Q4 2008 earnings call indicates substantial short-term negative implications for the company's stock price. Although the financial environment was extremely challenging, the negative $4.4 billion in net revenues and negative $2.1 billion in net earnings for the quarter reflect significant asset price declines and credit market stresses, overshadowing the firm's well-performing and competitive business lines. The lowered compensation ratios and strategic shifts indicate a cautious stance, but the immediate impact on stock price will likely be adverse.
