Goldman Sachs reported a strong first quarter with significant increases in FICC and equity trading revenues, although investment banking revenues were down due to lower transaction levels.

This could lead to increased scrutiny and possibly customer/client concerns over the next 1-2 weeks, likely impacting stock sentiment negatively.
