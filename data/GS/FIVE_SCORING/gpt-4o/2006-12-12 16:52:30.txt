Goldman Sachs reported a record year for 2006 with net revenues and earnings significantly surpassing prior records, driven by strong performances across all major business segments including Investment Banking, Trading and Principal Investments, and Asset Management. Management conveyed a positive outlook for continued growth, supported by a robust investment banking backlog and favorable capital market conditions. Although some risks like uncertainties in the sub-prime mortgage sector were noted, they appear contained and not significantly affecting other credit markets. Given the record results and optimistic forward-looking statements, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
