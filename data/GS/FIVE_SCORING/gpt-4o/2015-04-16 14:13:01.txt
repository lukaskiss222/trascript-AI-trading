Goldman Sachs posted strong Q1 2015 results with net revenues of $10.6 billion and a significant ROE of 14.7%. The firm benefited from increased client activity, particularly in Investment Banking and Institutional Client Services, due to market volatility driven by diverging central bank policies. Despite a decline in Investment Banking backlog, Goldman Sachs remains optimistic due to high CEO and Board confidence. However, the mention of potential back-end weighted share repurchases suggests caution regarding capital distribution. The company's strong performance and positioning are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock.
