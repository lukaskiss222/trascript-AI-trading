Goldman Sachs reported strong Q2 2008 results, with net earnings of $2.1 billion despite a challenging market environment. The firm demonstrated robust investment banking performance, particularly in M&A and equity underwriting, although its investment banking backlog declined. Trading revenues remained strong, but the firm experienced losses in leveraged lending. Overall, the firm's cautious yet opportunistic risk management suggests stability, but the market conditions remain volatile. This balance of strong results and market challenges suggests a neutral immediate impact on the stock.
