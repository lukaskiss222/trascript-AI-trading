Goldman Sachs reported strong Q3 2024 results, with notable revenue and EPS growth, exceeding market expectations. Performance strength was highlighted in Global Banking, Markets, and Asset Management, supported by increased M&A activity and record asset supervision. Management's optimistic commentary on banking backlog, while cautiously navigating regulatory uncertainties, reinforces confidence. Despite some consumer business drag, the strategic focus on high-margin businesses suggests short-term stock performance should be positive.
