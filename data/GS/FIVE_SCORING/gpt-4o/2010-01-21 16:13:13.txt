Goldman Sachs reported strong earnings, indicating robust financial performance with significant net revenue and earnings growth, and a return on equity of 22.5% for 2009. The company maintained a conservative financial profile with a high Tier 1 ratio and substantial liquidity. While trading and principal investments revenues slowed seasonally in the fourth quarter, the management reported a positive start to the new year, suggesting potential renewed client activity. However, regulatory uncertainties, particularly around proprietary trading and potential changes from the "Volcker Rule," pose risks but are not immediately quantifiable. Despite these regulatory challenges, Goldman's diversified business model and strong market positioning are likely to support its stock in the near term.
