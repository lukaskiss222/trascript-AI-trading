Goldman Sachs reported a third-quarter loss in 2011, citing challenges such as the Eurozone crisis and a weakened global economy that spurred declines in asset values and muted client activity. Despite this, the firm maintained a strong capital position and liquidity, continued share buybacks, and expressed optimism about its long-term prospects. However, the immediate concern about the economic environment and market volatility is likely to weigh on the stock, suggesting limited upside in the very short term.
