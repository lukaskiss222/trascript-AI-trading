Goldman Sachs reported mixed results with lower revenues and earnings compared to the previous year, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and reduced market activity. While the company is implementing significant cost-saving measures and continues stock repurchases, the cautious management tone and subdued guidance are likely to weigh on investor sentiment in the short term. Overall, the stock may experience downward pressure over the next couple of weeks.
