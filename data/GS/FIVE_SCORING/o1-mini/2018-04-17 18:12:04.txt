Goldman Sachs reported robust first-quarter performance with significant revenue and earnings growth, driven by strong performance in FICC and Equities. Management's positive outlook, increased shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, and strategic investments in growth initiatives indicate confidence in continued short-term strength. These factors are likely to generate a strong positive reaction in the stock market over the next couple of weeks.
