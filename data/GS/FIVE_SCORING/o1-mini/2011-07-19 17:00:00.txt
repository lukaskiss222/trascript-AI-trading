Goldman Sachs reported mixed second-quarter results with strong performance in Investment Banking offset by significant declines in FICC revenues due to macroeconomic uncertainties and reduced risk-taking. While cost-cutting measures and share buybacks may provide some support, the overall sentiment is tempered by underperformance and ongoing economic concerns. Consequently, the stock is likely to experience short-term negative pressure.
