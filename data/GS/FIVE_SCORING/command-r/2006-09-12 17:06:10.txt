The unchanged investment banking backlog and resilience in FICC revenues are positive signs. However, heightened market volatility and cautious investor sentiment could impact future earnings. The current quarter may experience a slight dip due to reduced trading activity and market uncertainty, but the medium to long-term outlook remains optimistic given Goldman's diverse business model and strong client relationships.
