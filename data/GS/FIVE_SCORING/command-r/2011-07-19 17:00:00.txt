Goldman Sachs' Q2 earnings call reveals a challenging quarter marked by global economic uncertainties and subdued client activity. The firm's performance was notably impacted by cautious risk positioning, especially in FICC, leading to lower revenues. Cost-cutting measures, targeted at reducing expenses by $1.2 billion, aim to enhance efficiency. Despite robust capital positions, management plans prudent capital allocation, focusing on maintaining a strong balance sheet. The short-term outlook remains guarded due to persistent market volatilities.
