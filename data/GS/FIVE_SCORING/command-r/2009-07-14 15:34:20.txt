The Goldman Sachs Q2 earnings call reveals a numbers game impacted by human emotions. A conservative approach to risk and a fragmented competitive landscape benefited Goldman's diverse business model. Except for M&A, which remains slow, the firm saw improved client activity across most sectors, especially FICC and equities trading. With elevated liquidity levels and a cautious stance on capital deployment, the short-term impact on the stock is neutral to positive.
