Goldman Sachs reported strong Q1 earnings with net revenues of $9.3 billion and a 10.9% annualized ROE. Highlights include the highest investment banking revenues since 2007 and significant growth in FICC client execution revenues. Despite some caution around the global economic recovery and regulatory uncertainties, the firm's solid performance and strategic focus are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
