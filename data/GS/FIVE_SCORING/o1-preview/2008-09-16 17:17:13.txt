Goldman Sachs reported decreased revenues and earnings due to challenging market conditions, with significant losses in mortgages, commercial real estate, and principal investments. While management emphasized strong liquidity and risk management, concerns about their exposure to failed institutions like Lehman Brothers and AIG, coupled with overall market turmoil, are likely to weigh on the stock. Therefore, the stock is expected to face negative pressure in the short term.
