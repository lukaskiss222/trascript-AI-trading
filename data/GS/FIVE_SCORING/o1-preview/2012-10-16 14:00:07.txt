Goldman Sachs reported solid third-quarter results with net revenues of $8.4 billion and EPS of $2.85, despite a challenging economic environment. The firm's increase in dividend payments and continued share repurchases signal management's confidence in their financial position. Additionally, proactive expense management and a strong capital ratio position the company favorably, suggesting a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
