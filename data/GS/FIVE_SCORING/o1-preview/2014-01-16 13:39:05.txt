Goldman Sachs reported solid Q4 and full-year results, with modest improvements over the prior year and a strong performance in Investment Banking. However, concerns about regulatory impacts like the Volcker Rule, lower revenues in Institutional Client Services, and lack of specific guidance may temper investor enthusiasm. As a result, the stock is likely to remain relatively stable in the short term.
