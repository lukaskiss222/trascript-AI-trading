Goldman Sachs reported strong third-quarter results, with net revenues of $12.3 billion and EPS of $6.13, showcasing robust performance despite market volatility. While they faced $1.5 billion in losses related to leveraged lending and took significant markdowns on mortgage positions, their diversified operations, especially in FICC and equities, helped offset these challenges. The firm's demonstrated resilience and ability to capitalize on market conditions suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
