### Analysis:

The earnings call for Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported strong financial results, with revenues of $9.1 billion and net earnings of $2 billion, but analysts were particularly focused on the balance sheet optimization and the potential impact on the stock price.

### Key Points:

1. **Balance Sheet Optimization:**
   - The company reduced its total assets by $56 billion and risk-weighted assets by $5 billion, with a focus on reducing low-return assets.
   - The balance sheet reduction was driven by a combination of regulatory requirements and increased client activity.
   - The company aims to continue optimizing its balance sheet to comply with new regulations and improve efficiency.

2. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - The company is preparing for the implementation of the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) by 2018, and it has already taken steps to mitigate the impact of the SLR.
   - The company expects to achieve an SLR ratio above 5% by 2018, but it has not set a specific target for SLR compliance.

3. **Client Activity:**
   - The company reported a mixed operating environment, with favorable conditions in certain businesses and headwinds in others.
   - The company's strong client franchise and diversified business model helped it generate strong relative returns.

4. **Investment Banking and Asset Management:**
   - Investment Banking revenue was $1.8 billion, with advisory revenues down 26% from the first quarter.
   - The company's Investment Management business reported strong performance, with assets under supervision reaching another record of $1.14 trillion.

### Conclusion:

Given the mixed operating environment and the focus on regulatory compliance, the stock price is likely to face short-term pressure. However, the company's strong client franchise and diversified business model suggest long-term potential. The stock price may experience volatility in the short term due to the balance sheet optimization and regulatory compliance efforts.
