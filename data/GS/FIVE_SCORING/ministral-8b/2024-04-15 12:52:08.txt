The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. reported strong first-quarter results, with net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion. This was driven by robust performance in Global Banking & Markets, with revenues of $9.7 billion and an 18% ROE. The company also saw growth in Advisory and Asset & Wealth Management, with revenues of $1.1 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The company's strategic focus on building a more durable business and executing on its objectives is evident in its mid-teens return expectations. The company is also well-positioned to benefit from the reopening of the capital markets, with strong demand for debt underwriting and financing services. However, the company's exposure to the Basel III proposal and the potential impact on its capital deployment hierarchy could pose a risk. Overall, the company's strong performance and strategic focus suggest a positive outlook for the stock, with a potential for further growth in the coming quarters.
