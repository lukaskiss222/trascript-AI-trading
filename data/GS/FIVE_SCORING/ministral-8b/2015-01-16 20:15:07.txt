The Goldman Sachs earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported a stable performance with revenues, earnings, and earnings per diluted share, which are all consistent with last year. However, the call also highlighted several challenges and uncertainties, such as the impact of the Swiss franc devaluation, the potential impact of the new regulations, and the continued volatility in the market. Additionally, the company's focus on cost-cutting measures and strategic acquisitions could have a positive impact on the stock price in the long term. However, the short-term impact is likely to be neutral, as the market is already aware of these challenges and uncertainties. Therefore, the rating for the short-term impact on the stock price is 0.
