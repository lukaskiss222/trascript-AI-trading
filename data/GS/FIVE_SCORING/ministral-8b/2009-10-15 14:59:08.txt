### Analysis:

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. reported strong third-quarter results, with net revenues of $12.4 billion, net earnings of $3.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share of $5.25. The company's performance was driven by a continued demand for expert advice and execution for its global client base, despite the challenging economic environment. The company's FICC business was a strong performer, with record performance in mortgages and second-best quarterly performance in credit. The company also saw higher levels of strategic dialogue and a significant increase in its backlog during the quarter.

However, the company's results were impacted by a challenging macroeconomic outlook and low consumer confidence, which led to lower investment banking revenues. The company's securities services business also continued to decline, reflecting lower seasonal dividend-related activity.

The company's management highlighted the importance of staying close to its clients during periods of market turmoil, which has been critical to its recent performance and will remain a key driver of its future performance. The company also emphasized the importance of managing its risks, capital, and liquidity levels in light of the difficult macro environment.

The company's guidance for 2009 projects $4.55-$5.05 EPS, which is well above the consensus estimate of $2.90. The company also expects its return on common equity to be 21.4%, which is well above the consensus estimate of 15.0%.
