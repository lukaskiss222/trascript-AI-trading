**Analysis:**

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. earnings call for Q4 2011 and full-year 2011 revealed a challenging macroeconomic environment, reduced client risk appetite, and lower revenue opportunities. The company's management provided a detailed overview of their financial results, emphasizing the impact of macroeconomic concerns, market volatility, and client risk aversion on their performance. The call highlighted the company's strong client franchise, ongoing efforts to manage expenses, and strategic growth initiatives, including a focus on emerging markets. Despite the challenges, the management team expressed confidence in the firm's long-term prospects and commitment to supporting their client franchise.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the company's lower-than-expected revenue guidance and the challenging macroeconomic environment. The stock is likely to face downward pressure as investors digest the earnings report and consider the potential impact of regulatory changes and market volatility on the company's performance. However, the company's strong client franchise, ongoing cost-cutting measures, and strategic growth initiatives suggest long-term potential, which could provide support for the stock price over the longer term.

**Rating:**
