Based on the provided transcript, Ceradyne's Q4 and full-year results show mixed signals. While the company achieved record annual sales, the lowered 2008 guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts signal short-term headwinds. However, management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
