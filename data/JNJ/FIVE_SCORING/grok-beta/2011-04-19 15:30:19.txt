Johnson & Johnson's Q1 earnings call presents a mixed outlook. The company beat earnings expectations, showing strength in pharmaceuticals with new product launches and positive developments like the amendment with Merck for REMICADE and SIMPONI. However, the Consumer segment faces challenges due to ongoing remediation efforts in the McNeil OTC business, expected to negatively impact both sales and P&L throughout 2011. While the medical device sector demonstrated modest growth, concerns around pricing pressure, particularly in hips and knees, and deflated expectations for OTC product launches in 2012 suggest potential short-term stock pressure.
