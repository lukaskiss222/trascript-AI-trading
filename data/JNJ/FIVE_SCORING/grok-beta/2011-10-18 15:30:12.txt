Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2011 earnings revealed robust sales growth, particularly due to the strength in the Pharmaceutical segment and better-than-expected earnings excluding special items. However, higher costs in the Consumer segment due to ongoing McNeil remediation efforts and integration costs for Crucell have impacted short-term profitability. The guidance for FY 2011, especially on the expense side, wasn't significant enough to change the market's medium-term outlook, but potential headwinds from looming austerity measures and consumer product relaunches could result in a neutral to slightly positive impact in the near term.
