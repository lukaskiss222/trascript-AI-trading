Johnson & Johnson reported a mixed Q1 2009 with sales decline due to currency impacts and loss of exclusivity for key pharmaceutical products. However, operational earnings growth was strong, driven by cost containment and strategic moves like acquisitions. Management expects a year of EPS growth, suggesting confidence in underlying business performance despite headwinds. The decreased sales forecast and concerns about lost exclusivity could lead to a cautious short-term market response over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
