Johnson & Johnson slightly lowered its sales and earnings guidance due to impacts from the McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalls and European pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, their focus on financial discipline and cost management, along with new product launches and strategic acquisitions, suggest resilience and mitigation efforts. The stock might see a negative reaction in the short term due to the revised guidance, but management's focus on long-term growth and operational efficiencies could temper any significant drop.
