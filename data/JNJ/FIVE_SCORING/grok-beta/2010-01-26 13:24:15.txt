Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlighted several key points:

- **Performance vs. Expectations**: J&J navigated through significant patent expirations successfully and exceeded their guidance on operational earnings, which suggests operational resilience despite market challenges. Record free cash flow generation shows financial strength which could support stock stability.

- **New Product Launches**: J&J launched five new molecular entities in 2009, with CEO Bill Weldon expressing optimism about their development speed and market potential. Growth in key pharmaceutical products like Remicade and the expectation of resolution of patent expirations behind them could buoy investor confidence.

- **Cost Management and Margin Expansion**: Despite ongoing gross margin pressures, J&J's operating margins improved on a pre-tax basis across all segments, indicating effective cost management without cutting necessary R&D or growth investments. This cost discipline could signal positive sentiments post earnings announcement.

- **Strategic Growth**: The company set a strategic focus on innovation, robust pipelines, global expansion, and talent development. Given no further significant patent losses and a robust product launch pipeline, this suggests a bullish long-term outlook, which might encourage short-term investment in anticipation of stronger growth.

- **Economic Environment**: J&J acknowledges macroeconomic challenges but sees stabilization and some improvement in consumer spending, which could limit the downside risk in the near term.

In summary, despite challenges with patent expirations, J&J's management indicated a positive outlook due to new product launches, cost management, and strategic positioning for growth. The stock should recover from any immediate negative reaction due to tempered growth expectations, leading to:
