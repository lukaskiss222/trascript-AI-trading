Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2008 earnings showed a strong beat on sales and earnings estimates, driven by robust performance in consumer healthcare and some device segments, alongside successful cost management initiatives. However, the company faces short-term headwinds including generic competition affecting pharmaceuticals like Risperdal, a decline in Procrit sales, and lower-than-expected market growth in certain device areas. The overall positive results and dividend increase might temporarily buoy the stock, but uncertainties around future pharmaceutical revenues and market share losses in key segments could pressure the stock price in the short term.
