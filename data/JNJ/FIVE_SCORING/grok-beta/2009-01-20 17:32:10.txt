Johnson & Johnson's Q4 2008 and full-year results, despite facing significant business and economic challenges, showcased strategic resilience and disciplined cost management, exemplified by stronger-than-expected adjusted EPS and an increase in operating margins.

Investors are likely to consider the potential opportunities from the economic downturn for acquisitions, the companyâ€™s strong financial position, and the focus on health prevention and innovation as positives, but the immediate guidance for 2009 suggests caution.
