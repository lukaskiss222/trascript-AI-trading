Johnson & Johnson experienced a significant impact from currency fluctuations, the loss of market exclusivity for key pharmaceutical products like RISPERDAL and TOPAMAX, and ongoing economic pressures affecting consumer spending and healthcare budgets. However, the underlying business showed operational growth, with EPS growth offsetting currency impact, a robust pharmaceutical pipeline, and strategic investments like those in Elan and Cougar Biotechnology. Despite challenges, Johnson & Johnson's stable and manageable growth in earnings suggests resilience but with negative short-term pressure due to currency and market condition impacts.
