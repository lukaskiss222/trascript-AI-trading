Johnson & Johnson’s Q3 2008 results reveal a mixed picture. While the company beat earnings and sales estimates, it provided lower than expected outlook for future growth, citing pricing pressures in the US and currency impacts. The company’s robust performance in consumer health and medical devices seems positive, but the tempered guidance, generic competition's impact, and economic concerns may weigh on short-term stock movement. Investors might react negatively to the uncertainties, particularly given the global economic turmoil and potential impacts on healthcare utilization.
