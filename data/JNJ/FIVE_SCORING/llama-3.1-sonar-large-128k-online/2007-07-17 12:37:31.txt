Based on the Q1 2024 earnings call transcript for Johnson & Johnson, here are the key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Indicators:
- The company reported solid financial performance, with operational sales growth of 7.6% worldwide and 7.4% outside of the U.S., excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine[1].
- Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 12.4% compared to the first quarter of 2023[1].
- The company saw significant pipeline progress, including regulatory and clinical milestones in Innovative Medicine and MedTech[1].
- Johnson & Johnson announced a 4.2% dividend increase, marking its 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases[1].

## Neutral to Negative Indicators:
- There were one-time special charges and higher marketing investments in the Innovative Medicine business, which affected some of the financial metrics[1].
- The effective tax rate was lower due to a tax benefit from the talc settlement proposal, but excluding special items, it was relatively stable[1].
- The upcoming acquisition of Shockwave Technologies is expected to cause a dilution to adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10 per share in 2024[1].

## Overall Impact:
Given the strong operational performance, significant pipeline progress, and the continuation of dividend payments, these factors are likely to support the stock price. However, the one-time charges and the expected dilution from the acquisition might introduce some short-term volatility.

### Conclusion:
The overall impact is likely to be positive due to the strong financial performance and pipeline progress, despite some minor short-term headwinds.
