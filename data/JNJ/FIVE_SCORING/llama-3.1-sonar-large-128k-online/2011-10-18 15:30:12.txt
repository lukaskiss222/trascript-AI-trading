The Q3 2011 earnings call for Johnson & Johnson reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Solid Sales Growth**: Despite macroeconomic challenges, Johnson & Johnson reported solid sales growth, particularly in the Pharmaceutical segment, driven by new product launches such as ZYTIGA and INCIVO. This positive performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors[3].

2. **Operational and Adjusted EPS**: The company delivered adjusted EPS of $1.24, exceeding analysts' estimates. This beat, combined with the overall positive sales growth, should be positively received by the market[3].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: The guidance for 2011 was maintained, with operational sales growth expected between 2.5% and 3.5%, and reported sales growth between 5% and 6% due to currency impacts. The adjusted EPS guidance was also increased, which is a positive indicator[3].

4. **Challenges in Medical Devices & Diagnostics**: The MD&D segment faced challenges, particularly in the U.S. knee market and cardiovascular care, due to macroeconomic conditions and increased competition. However, the company's ability to maintain or gain share in several businesses and introduce new innovations could mitigate some of these concerns[3].

5. **Acquisitions and Divestitures**: The ongoing progress with the Synthes acquisition and other strategic acquisitions and divestitures suggest a proactive approach to portfolio management, which could be seen as positive for long-term growth[3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, especially considering the strong performance in new product launches and the maintained guidance despite macroeconomic headwinds.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the solid earnings performance, positive guidance, and strong new product launches.
