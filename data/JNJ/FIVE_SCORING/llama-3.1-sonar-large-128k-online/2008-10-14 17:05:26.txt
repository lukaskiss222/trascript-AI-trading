Johnson & Johnson's third-quarter 2008 earnings transcript presents a mixed but largely positive outlook. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported solid financial results, with worldwide sales up 6.4% and adjusted earnings per share up 10.4% compared to the third quarter of 2007. The guidance for full-year 2008 earnings per share was also raised to $4.50-$4.53, excluding special items[4].

- **Operational Strength**: Despite challenges from generic competition and economic volatility, the company maintained strong operational growth, particularly in emerging markets and certain segments like Consumer Health Care and Medical Devices & Diagnostics[4].

- **Pipeline and R&D**: The Pharmaceutical Group highlighted a robust pipeline with several promising compounds, including Rivaroxaban, Paliperidone Palmitate, Golimumab, and Ustekinumab. These developments suggest potential for long-term growth[4].

- **Financial Stability**: Johnson & Johnson demonstrated financial strength with strong cash flows, a healthy balance sheet, and no exposure to sub-prime markets or failed financial services companies. The company also renewed its credit facilities at attractive rates[4].

- **Short-Term Challenges**: The company faced some short-term pressures, including the impact of currency fluctuations, generic competition, and lower sales in certain pharmaceutical products. However, these were largely managed through cost containment efforts and strategic investments[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the company's strong financial performance, robust pipeline, and financial stability. However, the immediate negative impact of currency fluctuations and some short-term challenges might temper the enthusiasm slightly.
