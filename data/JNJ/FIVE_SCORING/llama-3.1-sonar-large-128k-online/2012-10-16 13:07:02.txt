Johnson & Johnson's third-quarter 2012 earnings call presented several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Sales Growth**: The company reported a 6.5% increase in worldwide sales, driven by operational growth of 10.8%, despite negative currency impacts. The acquisition of Synthes contributed significantly to this growth[Transcript].
- **Pharmaceutical Segment Performance**: The pharmaceutical segment showed robust growth, with a 7% increase in sales, driven by strong performances from products like REMICADE, STELARA, SIMPONI, ZYTIGA, and VELCADE. The segment also saw expansion in emerging markets and Japan[Transcript].
- **Pipeline and R&D**: Johnson & Johnson highlighted a strong pipeline with several new product launches and regulatory approvals, including canagliflozin, TMC 435, and XARELTO. The companyâ€™s R&D strategy and global reach are expected to drive future growth[Transcript].
- **Guidance**: The company raised its full-year profit forecast, with operational EPS estimates between $5.27 and $5.32 per share, excluding special items[Transcript].

### Challenging Aspects:
- **Consumer Segment Decline**: The consumer segment saw a 4.3% decline in sales, primarily due to ongoing issues with product recalls and manufacturing under consent decrees[Transcript].
- **Currency and Economic Pressures**: Foreign currency, particularly the weakening euro, negatively impacted sales results by 4.3%. Economic pressures in Europe, especially in Southern and Central Europe, continued to affect procedure volumes and pricing in the MD&D segment[Transcript].
- **Special Items and Charges**: The company recorded several special items, including charges related to the discontinuation of Bapineuzumab IV, Synthes integration costs, and DePuy ASR hip-related costs, which affected reported net earnings[Transcript].

Given these points, the overall performance of Johnson & Johnson in the third quarter of 2012 was solid, with strong sales growth and a robust pharmaceutical pipeline. However, the consumer segment challenges and economic pressures might temper some of the optimism.

### Predicted Impact on Stock Price:
The strong operational performance, raised guidance, and positive pipeline developments are likely to offset some of the short-term challenges. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact, although it may not be significantly strong due to the ongoing economic and consumer segment issues.
