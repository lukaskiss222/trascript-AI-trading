4. **Positive Operational Margins**: The company expects to improve pretax operating margins by approximately 150 basis points, driven by favorable product mix, cost efficiencies, and lower selling and marketing expenses relative to sales growth[3].

5. **Investment and Cost Savings**: Johnson & Johnson plans to invest over $30 billion in R&D and capital investments in the U.S. over the next four years, while also implementing cost-saving measures expected to generate $600 million to $800 million in annual pre-tax savings by 2022[3].
