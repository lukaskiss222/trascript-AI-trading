Johnson & Johnson's second-quarter 2013 earnings call highlighted several positive and robust performance metrics that are likely to have a positive impact on the stock in the short term (1-2 weeks).

- **Strong Sales and Earnings Growth**: The company reported an 8.5% increase in sales and a 13.8% increase in adjusted EPS, exceeding analyst estimates. This strong performance is driven by the pharmaceutical segment, particularly new product launches like ZYTIGA, XARELTO, and INVOKANA[1][3%.
- **Improved Guidance**: Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year 2013 earnings guidance to $5.42-$5.49 per share, reflecting the company's confidence in its operational performance[3].
- **Successful Integration and Expansion**: The integration of Synthes is progressing well, and the company is seeing growth in emerging markets, especially in the BRIC countries. This expansion and integration are expected to continue driving growth[3].
- **Pipeline and Innovation**: The company has a strong pipeline with significant developments, including the FDA approval of SIMPONI for ulcerative colitis, the submission of ibrutinib for CLL and MCL, and the acquisition of Aragon Pharmaceuticals. These moves indicate a strong commitment to innovation and future growth[3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report, increased guidance, and promising pipeline and expansion efforts.
