Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2013 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points influencing the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Operational Performance**: The company reported an 8.5% increase in worldwide sales, driven by a 9.8% operational sales growth, largely due to the success of new pharmaceutical products and the integration of Synthes into the orthopedics business[3,.

2. **Guidance Update**: Johnson & Johnson increased its operational sales guidance for 2013 to 5.7% to 6.7% on a constant currency basis, which is higher than previous guidance. However, reported sales growth is expected to be lower due to currency impacts[3,.

3. **Pharmaceutical Segment Strength**: The pharmaceutical segment saw significant growth, particularly from products like ZYTIGA, XARELTO, and INVOKANA, which are expected to continue contributing to growth[3,.

4. **Consumer Segment Recovery**: The consumer segment is recovering well, especially in the OTC medicines business, with a plan to return about 75% of previously offline products to the market by the end of the year[3,.

5. **Challenges in Medical Devices**: While the medical devices segment saw overall growth, there were challenges in specific areas such as orthopedics, spine, and general surgery due to market dynamics, pricing pressures, and fewer selling days[3,.

6. **Currency Impact**: Despite a negative impact on sales from currency fluctuations, the impact on earnings is less pronounced due to the profitability mix across different regions[3,.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong performance in key segments and an optimistic outlook for the year. However, some short-term challenges, particularly in medical devices and currency impacts, might temper immediate stock gains.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's solid operational performance, increased guidance, and strong pharmaceutical segment growth. However, the tempering effects of currency and some challenges in the medical devices segment might prevent a significant rally.
