Johnson & Johnson's first-quarter 2015 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points:

- **Sales and Operational Performance**: Despite a 4.1% decrease in worldwide sales due to currency headwinds, operational sales grew 3.1%, and excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operational growth was 5.7%. The Pharmaceutical segment showed strong growth, driven by new products like INVOKANA/INVOKAMET and XARELTO.
- **Earnings and Guidance**: Adjusted EPS was $1.56, down 4.3% due to currency impacts, but operational EPS growth on a constant currency basis was 3.7%. The company updated its adjusted EPS guidance for 2015 to $6.04-$6.19, reflecting higher operational performance and gains from divestitures, partially offset by currency headwinds.
- **Management's Tone**: Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage through currency headwinds and maintain growth, highlighting strong underlying sales growth, solid operational earnings, and decisive portfolio actions.
- **Future Outlook**: The company anticipates continued growth driven by new product launches, particularly in the Pharmaceutical segment, and expects to mitigate the impact of currency headwinds through disciplined portfolio management and strategic divestitures.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong operational performance, solid guidance, and management's confident tone.
