The transcript for Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2011 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance. Here are the key points:

1. **Sales Growth**: Johnson & Johnson reported solid sales growth, particularly in the Pharmaceuticals segment, which saw a 7.5% increase driven by strong performance from recently launched products like STELARA and SIMPONI. The Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment showed modest growth, and the Consumer segment faced challenges due to manufacturing and quality issues at McNeil[4].

2. **Guidance**: The company updated its guidance for 2011, reflecting an operational sales increase of 2.5% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS estimates of $4.74 to $4.84 per share, excluding special items. The guidance also includes a positive impact from currency movements, potentially increasing reported sales growth to 5.5% to 6.5%[4].

3. **Challenges and Remediation**: The McNeil Consumer Healthcare business is undergoing significant remediation efforts due to a Consent Decree with the FDA, which is expected to impact earnings more than initially anticipated, with an estimated $0.12 per share drag. However, the company is making progress in addressing these issues[4].

4. **Merck Agreement**: The amended agreement with Merck regarding REMICADE and SIMPONI distribution rights is positive but not expected to significantly impact 2011 earnings due to transitional costs and investment plans[4].

5. **Operational Performance**: Despite some challenges, the company is seeing sequential improvements in healthcare market utilization and strong performance in emerging markets. The R&D pipeline remains robust, with several significant developments and approvals during the quarter[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the following:

- Strong sales growth in the Pharmaceuticals segment.
- Updated and slightly improved guidance.
- Robust R&D pipeline and new product approvals.
- Progress in addressing manufacturing and quality issues.

However, the negative impact from the McNeil remediation and some pricing pressures in the Medical Devices segment might temper the overall enthusiasm.
