Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2008 earnings call presents a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported a 7.7% increase in worldwide sales, driven partly by the successful launch of ZYRTEC and favorable currency exchange rates. Adjusted earnings per share were up 8.6%, exceeding analyst estimates[4].
- **Operational Growth and Margins**: Despite operational growth of only 2.6%, the company managed to improve its margins through cost-cutting measures and restructuring programs. This has positively impacted their operating performance[4].
- **Challenges in Pharmaceuticals**: The pharmaceutical segment faced significant challenges, including generic competition affecting products like DURAGESIC and RISPERDAL, and a decline in ESA sales. However, growth drivers like REMICADE and VELCADE showed strong performance[4].
- **Medical Devices and Diagnostics**: This segment saw slower growth due to lower sales of drug-eluting stents and possible early signs of reduced procedure volumes in the U.S.[4].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company slightly raised its EPS guidance for 2008 but remains cautious, reflecting the impact of inventory build-ups and expected generic competition later in the year[4].

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and successful product launches (e.g., ZYRTEC) will likely have a positive short-term impact.
- However, the challenges in the pharmaceutical segment and potential slowdown in medical device procedures might temper this positivity.

**Conclusion**:
The overall strong financials and positive operational improvements are likely to outweigh the short-term challenges, leading to a positive impact on the stock price.

**Rating**: 1
