Johnson & Johnson's 2013 fourth-quarter and full-year results indicate strong performance across several key metrics, but there are also some nuanced factors to consider for the short-term impact on the stock price.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported a 6.1% increase in full-year sales to $71.3 billion, with adjusted EPS up 8.2% to $5.52. This exceeds expectations and reflects strong operational growth[2].
- **Pharmaceutical Segment**: Exceptional performance with 12% operational sales growth, driven by new product launches and strong market share gains in key therapeutic areas[3].
- **Guidance**: The company provided robust guidance for 2014, with expected EPS ranging from $5.75 to $5.85, which is in line with analyst expectations[3].

### Neutral to Negative Factors:
- **Currency Impact**: The devaluation of the Japanese yen is expected to negatively impact gross margin and EPS by approximately $0.11 in 2014. Other currency fluctuations could also affect reported sales and earnings[3].
- **Pricing Pressures**: Expected pricing pressures, particularly in Europe, will negatively impact pretax operating margins by about 50 basis points[3].
- **Divestiture Impact**: The divestiture of the ortho clinical diagnostics business, although positive in the long term, may have a short-term dilutive effect on earnings[3].

### Management's Tone and Strategic Outlook:
- **Confident Outlook**: Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue delivering strong results, driven by innovation, globalization, and execution excellence. The focus on long-term growth drivers and strategic initiatives, such as the integration of Synthes and the expansion in emerging markets, suggests a positive long-term outlook[3].

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive but may be tempered by the immediate currency and pricing pressures.
