Johnson & Johnson's first-quarter 2016 earnings call presented several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Signals:
- The company reported strong operational sales growth of 3.9%, excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures, and hepatitis C sales, which was 6.9% worldwide[4].
- Adjusted EPS increased by 7.7% to $1.68, exceeding analyst estimates, and on a constant currency basis, it was up 10% to $1.72[4].
- The Pharmaceutical segment showed robust growth, driven by new and core products, including significant contributions from immunology and oncology products like REMICADE, STELARA, IMBRUVICA, and DARZALEX[4].
- The company updated its guidance for 2016, increasing the range for adjusted EPS to $6.53-$6.68 per share, which is higher than previous guidance[4].

## Mixed Signals:
- Currency translation had a negative impact on sales and earnings, though less severe than previously anticipated[4].
- Challenges in the diabetes market, particularly in the consumer Medical Device segment, were noted due to pricing pressure and competition from new pumps[4].
- The Venezuelan devaluation affected operational growth, particularly in the Consumer segment[4].
- The EMA is investigating an increase in amputations associated with INVOKANA, although this is not yet a significant concern given the positive outcomes from other studies[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call was positive, with strong operational performance, improved guidance, and a robust pipeline of products. However, the currency impacts and specific market challenges could introduce some short-term volatility.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong operational results, increased guidance, and the company's optimistic outlook for the year.
