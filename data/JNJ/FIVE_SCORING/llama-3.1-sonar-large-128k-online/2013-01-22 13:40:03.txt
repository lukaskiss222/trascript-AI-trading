Johnson & Johnson's 2012 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call presented several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported solid results, with fourth-quarter sales of $17.6 billion, an 8% increase over the same period in 2011, and full-year sales of $67.2 billion, a 3.4% increase. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year were $1.19 and $5.10, respectively, showing increases of 5.3% and 2.0%[1][2].

2. **Operational Growth and Acquisitions**: The acquisition of Synthes, Inc. contributed significantly to operational growth, particularly in the medical devices and diagnostics segment. This integration is progressing well and is expected to continue driving growth[1][2].

3. **Pharmaceutical Segment Strength**: The pharmaceutical segment showed strong growth driven by new product launches, such as ZYTIGA, INCIVO, and XARELTO. These products are expected to continue driving growth in 2013[1][2].

4. **Consumer Segment Recovery**: The consumer segment is recovering from past quality and supply issues, with a plan to return about 75% of the brands to the marketplace in 2013. This recovery, along with strong performance in other consumer areas like oral care and skincare, is expected to contribute positively[1].

5. **Guidance for 2013**: Johnson & Johnson provided guidance for 2013, including operational sales growth of 5.2% to 6.2% on a constant currency basis and estimated earnings per share of $5.35 to $5.45. The guidance takes into account various factors such as generic competition, divestitures, and pricing pressures[1][2].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting strong operational performance, successful new product launches, and a solid outlook for 2013. However, there are also notes of caution regarding generic competition, pricing pressures, and the impact of the Affordable Care Act.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings, solid guidance, and the company's strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining growth.
