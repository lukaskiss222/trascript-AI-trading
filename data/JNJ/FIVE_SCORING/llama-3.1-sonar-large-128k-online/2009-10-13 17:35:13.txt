The earnings transcript for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2009 reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: While Johnson & Johnson reported solid operational results, the company faced significant challenges due to generic competition in the pharmaceutical segment, particularly with products like Risperdal and Topamax. However, the medical devices and diagnostics segment showed strong performance, especially in areas like DePuy, Ethicon, and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics.

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided guidance for 2009, expecting operational sales growth to be between -1% and 1% on a constant currency basis, with potential negative impacts from currency fluctuations. The EPS guidance was narrowed to between $4.65 and $4.70, excluding special items.

3. **Cost Management and Efficiency**: Johnson & Johnson emphasized its disciplined approach to cost management, which helped improve operating margins. The company also highlighted its focus on investing in growth opportunities while maintaining a strong financial position.

4. **Pipeline and Innovations**: The company highlighted several promising pipeline developments, including new products and technologies in the medical devices and diagnostics segment, which could drive long-term growth.

5. **Healthcare Reform Concerns**: There were concerns about the potential impact of healthcare reform, particularly the proposed medical device tax, which could be significant for the industry.

Given these points:

- The mixed financial performance and challenges in the pharmaceutical segment might initially concern investors.
- However, the strong performance in the medical devices and diagnostics segment, along with the company's robust pipeline and cost management, suggest long-term potential.
- The guidance and outlook, while cautious due to economic and currency factors, indicate a stable financial position.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term, as the company's robust pipeline, cost management, and strong segments offset some of the current challenges.
