Johnson & Johnson's third-quarter 2017 earnings call highlighted several positive factors that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price:

## Strong Sales and Earnings Growth
- The company reported a 10.3% increase in worldwide sales, driven by strong performance in the Pharmaceutical segment, particularly in oncology and immunology. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 13.1% compared to the same period in 2016[1][3%.

## Robust Guidance
- The company increased its full-year sales and adjusted earnings guidance, with expected sales in the range of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion and adjusted EPS between $7.25 and $7.30 per share. This increase is partly due to favorable currency movements[1][3].

## Successful Acquisitions and Integration
- The integration of Actelion and Medical Optics is on track, contributing positively to growth. The company is confident in the continued accretion from these acquisitions in 2018[1][3].

## Resilience to External Factors
- Despite minor impacts from hurricanes, the company's global manufacturing network and supply chain remain robust, with no material impact expected on future results[1][3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong performance, increased guidance, and successful integration of recent acquisitions.
