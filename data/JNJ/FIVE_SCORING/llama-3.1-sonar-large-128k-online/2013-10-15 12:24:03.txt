Johnson & Johnson's third-quarter 2013 earnings call presented several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Pharmaceutical Segment Performance**: The pharmaceutical segment showed significant growth, driven by products like REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA, VELCADE, and new launches such as XARELTO and INVOKANA. This segment's operational sales growth of approximately 11% is a strong driver of overall company performance[3|.
- **Increased Guidance**: The company raised its full-year 2013 earnings guidance to $5.44 - $5.49 per share, excluding special items, which is higher than previous guidance[1][3].
- **Operational Efficiency**: The company reported improved gross margins, largely due to the mix of the business with pharmaceuticals driving growth and cost containment initiatives across various businesses[3].
- **Global Growth**: Double-digit operational growth in the BRIC markets and strong performance in Europe were highlighted, which contributes to the company's overall growth[3].

### Challenging Aspects:
- **Special Items Impact**: The third quarter included significant special items, such as litigation expenses and integration costs related to the Synthes acquisition, which negatively impacted net earnings by $0.32 per share[1][3].
- **Currency Impact**: The negative impact of currency fluctuations reduced reported sales growth, though this was partially offset by the strengthening of the euro[1][3].
- **Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment**: This segment saw essentially flat sales on an operational basis, with some areas like spine and diabetes care experiencing declines due to pricing pressures and competitive factors[3].
- **Integration Challenges**: The integration of DePuy and Synthes faced some disruptions, particularly in the U.S. spine business, which affected sales performance[3].

Given these points, the overall impression is that Johnson & Johnson's strong pharmaceutical performance and increased guidance will likely outweigh the short-term challenges. Therefore, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
