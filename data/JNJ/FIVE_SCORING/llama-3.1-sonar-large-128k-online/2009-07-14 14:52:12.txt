The earnings call for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for the second quarter of 2009 presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Key Points:
- **Operational Performance**: Despite the challenging economic environment, JNJ reported solid operational results, with underlying business growth of approximately 6% operationally, excluding the impact of generics and new drug eluting stent competitors[4].
- **Generic Competition**: Significant impact from the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for RISPERDAL and TOPOMAX, which affected pharmaceutical segment sales[4].
- **Currency Impact**: Negative currency translation impact of approximately 6% on sales and $0.06 on EPS[4].
- **Guidance**: Maintained full-year operational EPS guidance of $4.60 to $4.70, despite the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions[4].
- **Pipeline and Acquisitions**: Positive developments in the pharmaceutical pipeline, including new product launches and strategic acquisitions (e.g., Cougar Biotechnology and Elan Corporation)[4].
- **Economic and Healthcare Reform Pressures**: Continued pressure on pricing, particularly in orthopedics and hospital capital spending, and potential indirect impact from healthcare reform agreements[4].

### Short-Term Impact on Stock Price:
Given these factors, here are the key considerations:

- **Positive Aspects**: Strong operational performance, robust pipeline, and strategic acquisitions could support the stock.
- **Negative Aspects**: Significant generic competition, negative currency impact, and economic pressures on certain segments could weigh on the stock.

However, the overall guidance and the company's ability to manage costs and maintain financial discipline are positive indicators.

### Conclusion:
Considering these points, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact. The company's solid operational performance and robust pipeline offset some of the negative factors such as generic competition and economic pressures.
