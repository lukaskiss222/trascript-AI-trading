Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2007 earnings call presents a mix of positive and challenging factors that could influence the short-term stock performance.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Results**: The company reported solid financial results, with worldwide sales up 12.7% and adjusted earnings per share up 8.2% compared to the same period in 2006[4|.
- **Cost Management and Efficiency**: Johnson & Johnson has made significant progress in cost-cutting measures, expecting $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost savings for 2008. This has helped maintain operating margins despite sales pressures in certain markets[4|.
- **Pipeline and Product Launches**: The company highlighted several promising products and pipeline developments, including FDA approvals and upcoming launches, which suggest long-term growth potential[4|.
- **Share Repurchase Program**: The initiation of a $10 billion share repurchase program demonstrates a commitment to returning value to shareholders[4].

### Challenging Factors
- **Sales Pressures**: The company faced sales pressures in the pharmaceutical segment due to generic competition, declining ESA markets, and reduced sales of drug-eluting stents. These factors negatively impacted operational sales growth[4|.
- **Competitive Environment**: Increased competition in the stent market and challenges in the spine business have affected sales and market share. The U.S. price for stents was down about 5%, and international prices were also lower[4|.
- **Regulatory and Reimbursement Uncertainties**: Uncertainties around reimbursement for erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) and label changes for certain products introduced some instability[4].

Given these mixed signals, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility but is generally well-positioned due to its broad-based business model, cost management, and strong pipeline.

### Conclusion
The company's ability to manage costs, invest in future growth, and maintain a strong pipeline suggests that any short-term pressures may be mitigated. However, the immediate impact of sales pressures and competitive challenges could result in a slightly negative or neutral short-term stock performance.
