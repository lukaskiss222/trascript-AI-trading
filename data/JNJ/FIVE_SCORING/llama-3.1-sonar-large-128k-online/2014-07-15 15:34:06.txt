Johnson & Johnson's second-quarter 2014 earnings call highlighted several positive and some cautionary notes that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Operational Performance**: The company reported a 9.1% increase in sales, with a 9.4% operational growth, driven by new product launches and strong performance in the pharmaceutical segment[1].
- **Pharmaceutical Segment Growth**: The pharmaceutical segment saw a 21.1% operational growth, led by new products like OLYSIO, ZYTIGA, XARELTO, and INVOKANA[1].
- **Increased Earnings Guidance**: Despite some headwinds, the company raised its earnings guidance for the full year, reflecting confidence in its ongoing performance[1].
- **Divestiture and Share Buyback**: The divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and plans to use the proceeds for share buybacks are expected to mitigate EPS impact and potentially boost shareholder value[1].

### Cautionary Notes
- **Competition and Pricing Pressures**: The company faces upcoming competition for OLYSIO, which is expected to reduce its current high sales run rate. Additionally, there are ongoing pricing pressures in various segments, including orthopedics and diabetes care[1].
- **Currency Impact**: The devaluation of the Japanese Yen and potential currency fluctuations could negatively impact gross margins and EPS[1].
- **Biosimilar Competition**: Biosimilars entering the market, particularly for REMICADE, could pose a challenge, although the company expects a more limited impact compared to generic competition in small molecules[1].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive but tempered response in the short term. The strong operational performance, increased earnings guidance, and strategic moves like divestitures and share buybacks are positive indicators. However, the upcoming competition for key products and ongoing pricing pressures introduce some uncertainty.
