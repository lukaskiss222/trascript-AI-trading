The earnings transcript for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2010 reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Lowered Guidance**: The company reduced its operational sales guidance for 2010 due to the impact of the McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalls and increased pricing pressures in Europe, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. This adjustment could lead to short-term investor caution.

2. **Operational Challenges**: The suspension of manufacturing at McNeil's Fort Washington facility and ongoing pricing pressures in Europe are expected to continue affecting sales and earnings. These challenges may dampen investor sentiment in the near term.

3. **Mitigation Efforts**: Despite these headwinds, the company is focusing on cost containment, operational efficiencies, and new product launches, which could help mitigate some of the negative impacts. However, these efforts may not fully offset the current challenges.

4. **European Pricing Pressures**: The mid-single-digit pricing pressures in Europe, primarily affecting pharmaceuticals, are expected to accelerate in the second half of 2010 and into 2011. This could continue to weigh on investor confidence.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, operational challenges, and ongoing pricing pressures.
