The second-quarter 2012 earnings call for Johnson & Johnson revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: While the company reported a decrease in overall sales by 0.7% due to currency impacts, operational sales grew by 3.5%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 1.6% to $1.30, excluding special items[2][5].

2. **Synthes Acquisition**: The acquisition of Synthes contributed positively to operational sales growth and is expected to be accretive to earnings. However, integration costs and disruptions in certain businesses were noted[5].

3. **Guidance Adjustments**: The company updated its full-year 2012 guidance to reflect the Synthes acquisition, divestitures, and other business updates. Operational EPS guidance was increased to $5.25-$5.32, but reported EPS could be affected by currency rates[5].

4. **Macro and Market Pressures**: The company faces continued pressures from currency fluctuations, pricing challenges in Europe, and supply disruptions in some segments. However, these challenges were largely anticipated and factored into the guidance[2][5].

5. **Strategic Priorities and Innovation**: CEO Alex Gorsky outlined a strong commitment to innovation, global expansion, and excellence in execution. The company is focusing on strategic growth areas, such as emerging markets and new product launches, which could drive long-term growth[5].

Given these points:

- The positive impact from the Synthes acquisition and the updated guidance suggest a stable to slightly positive outlook.
- The ongoing macroeconomic and market pressures, however, could keep the stock from rallying significantly in the short term.
- The company's ability to manage these challenges and its focus on innovation and growth could mitigate negative impacts.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the balanced mix of positive and negative factors.
