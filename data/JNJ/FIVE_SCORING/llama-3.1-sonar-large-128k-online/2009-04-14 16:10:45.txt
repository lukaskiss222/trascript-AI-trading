Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2009 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- The company reported solid operational performance despite economic challenges, with underlying business growth of approximately 4% operationally, excluding the impact of generics and new drug eluting stent competitors[4].
- Strong performances in skincare, Listerine, and certain medical device segments, such as orthopedics and surgery, indicate resilience in key areas[4].
- The company's pharmaceutical pipeline showed progress, with approvals and pending approvals for several key products like Stelara, Simponi, and Priligy[4].
- Financial discipline and cost management efforts led to an improvement in pre-tax operating margins, although this is not expected to continue at the same level throughout the year[4].

### Negative Factors
- The overall sales were down due to currency impacts and the loss of market exclusivity for several key pharmaceutical products, including Risperdal and Topamax, which significantly affected pharmaceutical segment sales[4].
- The consumer segment faced challenges, including declines in over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, and increased private label competition[4].
- The medical device and diagnostics segment was impacted by lower sales of drug eluting stents and currency fluctuations[4].
- Guidance for 2009 includes the potential for a negative impact on sales and EPS due to currency movements, which could be more significant than initially anticipated[4].

### Conclusion
Given the balanced mix of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to experience minimal short-term impact. The company's strong operational performance and pipeline progress are offset by the significant headwinds from generic competition and currency fluctuations.
