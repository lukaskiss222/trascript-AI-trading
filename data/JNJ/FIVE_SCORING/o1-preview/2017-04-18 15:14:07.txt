Johnson & Johnson's Q1 earnings were mostly in line with expectations, showing a slight EPS beat and stable guidance. The upcoming Actelion acquisition could be a positive catalyst, but modest revenue growth and softness in the Consumer segment may balance investor reactions. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the short term.
