Johnson & Johnson reported solid Q2 results with strong sales growth in pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and adjusted earnings per share increased. However, net earnings declined due to special items, and the company maintained its full-year guidance despite outperformance, citing increased investments in R&D and SG&A. Given the mixed signals and unchanged outlook, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the short term.
