Johnson & Johnson reported strong first-quarter earnings, exceeding analyst expectations and slightly raising full-year EPS guidance. The robust performance was driven by the successful OTC launch of ZYRTEC and growth in the Consumer segment, along with positive developments in their pharmaceutical pipeline. While management acknowledged some challenges, such as generic competition and potential economic headwinds, the overall tone was optimistic, suggesting a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
