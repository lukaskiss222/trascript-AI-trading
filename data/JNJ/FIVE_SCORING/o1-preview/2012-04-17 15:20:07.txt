Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2012 earnings call presented mixed outcomes. The company reported increased earnings per share and solid growth in its pharmaceutical segment, particularly in immunology and oncology. However, challenges persist in the Consumer segment due to manufacturing issues and delayed OTC product recovery, along with ongoing litigation and pressure on gross margins, which may offset positive sentiments in the short term.
