Johnson & Johnson's earnings call revealed short-term challenges including lowered guidance due to currency headwinds, supply disruptions in their OTC and MD&D businesses, and ongoing remediation efforts. While the Synthes acquisition is a positive long-term move, these immediate issues may put downward pressure on the stock. The stock is likely to face negative impact in the short term due to these concerns.
