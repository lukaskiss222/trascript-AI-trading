Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2020 earnings transcript shows a significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the Medical Devices segment. While the company experienced declines across most segments, some saw surprising resilience, particularly Consumer Health's OTC and Oral Care divisions in the US.  Management highlights a recovery in some areas, but acknowledges continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's impact on procedure volumes and consumer behavior in the coming weeks and months.  This suggests short-term volatility with potential for near-term recovery but sustained caution due to the pandemic's unpredictable evolution.
