Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2013 earnings report showed strong operational growth across most segments, particularly in pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  The addition of Synthes contributed to the overall positive performance.  However, some headwinds remain, including a negative impact from currency fluctuations and adjustments related to managed Medicaid, which may impact short-term sentiment. Overall, the company's guidance suggests a continuation of positive momentum, but the stock price impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the combination of positive and potentially negative factors in the short term.
