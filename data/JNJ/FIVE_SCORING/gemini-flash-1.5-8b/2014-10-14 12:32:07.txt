Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2014 earnings transcript indicates strong performance, driven by robust growth in Pharmaceuticals, particularly the success of OLYSIO.  Management's commentary on continued investment in R&D and new product launches, along with a focus on maintaining a competitive position in key markets, suggests investor confidence should be maintained for the short-term.  The outlook for 2014 is positive with an expected increase in sales and earnings, exceeding analyst expectations, and further supporting the stock price's positive momentum.
