Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlights a company navigating a challenging economic environment. While sales saw a slight decline in Q4 2008 reflecting broader industry pressures and generic competition, adjusted earnings per share were up.  Management emphasized long-term strategies, including continued investments in R&D and new product development, diversification into emerging markets, and cost-cutting measures. Short-term fluctuations in currency, and customer inventory adjustments may present near-term headwinds, but the company's strong financial position and focus on innovation suggest a resilient outlook for the next 1-2 weeks.
