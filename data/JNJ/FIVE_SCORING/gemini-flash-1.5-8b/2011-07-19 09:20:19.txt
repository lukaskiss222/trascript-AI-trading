Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2011 earnings call highlights strong operational growth across most segments, exceeding analyst expectations.  Management expressed confidence in long-term market growth despite near-term headwinds, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.  The call underscores a strategy of continued investment in R&D, new product launches, and emerging markets, despite ongoing internal pressures at DePuy and some lingering impacts from OTC recalls impacting the consumer segment.  The stock is likely to see positive, but potentially tempered, short-term gains.
