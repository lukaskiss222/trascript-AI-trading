J&J's Q3 2021 earnings show strong performance across most segments, especially Pharmaceuticals with key brands exceeding expectations.  While the Medical Devices segment faced some headwinds related to the Delta variant, management expresses confidence in the long-term attractiveness of the market and anticipates a continued recovery. The company is also managing through staffing shortages and supply constraints but projects a stronger Q4 performance than Q3.  The overall positive outlook and updated guidance support a positive near-term impact on the stock price.
