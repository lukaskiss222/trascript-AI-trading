Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2017 earnings call highlights a positive outlook with improved guidance incorporating the Actelion acquisition.  While some consumer segments faced headwinds from category slowdowns and macro factors, management emphasized expected improvements in the latter part of the year.  The steady growth in certain key pharmaceutical categories and a focus on cost-cutting in both Consumer and Medical Device divisions suggest a resilient short-term outlook, with the expected closing of the Actelion acquisition further boosting investor sentiment.
