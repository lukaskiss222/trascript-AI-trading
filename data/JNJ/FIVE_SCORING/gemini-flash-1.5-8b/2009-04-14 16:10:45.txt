Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2009 earnings show a decline in sales, largely due to currency fluctuations and generic competition.  However, management highlights strong operational growth in certain segments, particularly in Asia/Pacific/Africa and skincare,  and emphasizes continued discipline in managing costs. Positive guidance on the overall outlook, coupled with management's reassurance of operational strength—including strong performances from certain product lines, despite the economic challenges—suggests a short-term neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price.
