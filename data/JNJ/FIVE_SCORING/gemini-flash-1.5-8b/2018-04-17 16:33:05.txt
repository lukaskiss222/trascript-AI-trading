Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2018 earnings call highlighted strong pharmaceutical performance, exceeding analyst expectations.  Management emphasized continued momentum in key drug categories like DARZALEX and ZYTIGA, driven by strong demand and market share gains.  The call also addressed some concerns around pricing pressures in the medical device segment, particularly orthopedics, suggesting the potential for some short-term stock price pressure there.
