Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2013 earnings call shows continued strong performance in pharmaceuticals, particularly with new product launches like XARELTO and ZYTIGA driving significant growth.  While the medical devices segment experienced some pressure, management highlighted growth in some areas, like cardiovascular care, and the successful integration of the DePuy Synthes acquisition is progressing.  The call suggests a focus on long-term strategic positioning, with a cautious outlook on the overall healthcare market and some short-term headwinds in consumer and medical devices.
