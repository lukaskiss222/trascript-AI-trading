Johnson & Johnson reported strong first-quarter 2008 earnings exceeding analyst expectations, driven by consumer segment growth (particularly ZYRTEC's OTC launch) and favorable currency effects. However, the company highlighted potential headwinds from slower procedure volumes in the medical device segment, generic competition, and a decline in PROCRIT sales.  While management emphasized a robust pipeline and cost-cutting efforts, near-term uncertainty surrounding procedure volumes and market dynamics suggest limited short-term stock price impact.
