Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlights strong Pharmaceutical segment growth, particularly in oncology, driven by DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, and ZYTIGA.  Positive market development and share gains for these products suggest continued momentum.  Management's focus on responsible pricing and innovation for products like TREMFYA positions J&J for future growth in the pharmaceutical sector. However, the Medical Devices segment faces some headwinds and the Consumer segment's growth is expected to be more modest. The guidance implies a potential short-term positive impact from tax legislation and divestment actions.
