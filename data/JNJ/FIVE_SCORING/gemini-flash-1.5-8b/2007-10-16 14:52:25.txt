Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlights strong operational growth across segments, particularly in Consumer Health, offsetting some pressures in Pharmaceuticals. Management provided reassuring guidance for 2008, including a share repurchase program and cost-cutting measures to offset potential short-term challenges (e.g., patent expirations and generic competition).  The call's focus on clinical trial progress for new drugs and new avenues for growth in segments like medical devices suggests a positive outlook for future revenue and EPS growth.
