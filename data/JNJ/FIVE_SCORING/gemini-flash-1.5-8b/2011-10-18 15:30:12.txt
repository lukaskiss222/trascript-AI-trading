Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2011 earnings call indicates continued positive momentum, despite macro headwinds.  Strong performance in some segments, particularly pharmaceuticals, and positive guidance for adjusted EPS growth underscore management confidence.  However, the call highlighted persisting soft procedure volumes in Medical Devices & Diagnostics, as well as continued challenges in OTC and some women's health products.  This suggests potential short-term stock price pressure, but overall this call points toward a generally positive outlook for the coming weeks.
