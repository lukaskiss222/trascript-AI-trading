Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlights ongoing challenges in the consumer healthcare segment, particularly with the McNeil recall.  Management acknowledges a slight decrease in volume and pricing pressure, though they project limited long-term impact on the consumer segment.  The significant drop in CYPHER sales due to intensified competition within the medical device space and the effects of health care reform negatively impacted growth.  Overall, the earnings call points to short-term pressure on price and volume; however, management's focus on new product launches and strategic acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and medical device spaces suggests confidence in long-term growth.
