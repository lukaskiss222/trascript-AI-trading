Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2018 earnings call highlighted strong performance in Pharmaceuticals, driven by double-digit growth in key products and new launches.  Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to maintain above-market growth and pointed to several catalysts. The Consumer segment, however, underperformed expectations, and management acknowledged the need to improve this segment's performance in the second half of the year. Given the strong performance in Pharma and the planned new product launches, the stock price is likely to see a positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks.
