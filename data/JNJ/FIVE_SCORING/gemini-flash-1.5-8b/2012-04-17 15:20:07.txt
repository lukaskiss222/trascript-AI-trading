Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2012 earnings call highlights mixed results.  While the company saw solid earnings per share and operational growth in certain areas (particularly international pharmaceuticals and some medical devices), generic competition and lower OTC production due to the Consent Decree pose challenges.  Management's cautious guidance and focus on long-term strategies suggest a potential for short-term volatility in the stock price, but overall positivity about the company's long-term prospects.
