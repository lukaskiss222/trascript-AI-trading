Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlighted strong performance, driven by pharmaceutical successes like OLYSIO, XARELTO, and INVOKANA.  Management's emphasis on innovation and a robust pipeline, along with cost-cutting measures, suggests continued growth potential, despite currency headwinds and some anticipated decelerations in sales from OLYSIO.  The call also discussed strategic divestitures, which is likely to positively affect the stock in short term.
