Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2015 earnings call highlighted strong operational growth in consumer and certain pharmaceutical segments, driven by new product launches and market share gains, particularly in INVOKANA.  Management reaffirmed their commitment to growth via new product development and acquisitions,  and highlighted a $10 billion share repurchase program.  Given the strong operational performance and management's optimistic outlook, this bodes well for the stock.
