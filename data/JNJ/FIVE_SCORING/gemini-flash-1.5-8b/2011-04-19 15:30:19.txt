Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2011 earnings were generally positive, exceeding some analyst estimates.  Management highlighted continued growth in pharmaceuticals (especially immunology products) and some sequential improvement in the Consumer segment (excluding the McNeil issues).  However, the McNeil Consent Decree and associated remediation costs, along with some soft prices in the DePuy franchise, present short-term headwinds.  The short-term impact on the stock is likely to be mildly positive as positive aspects outweigh the negative.
