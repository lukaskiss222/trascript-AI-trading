Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2013 earnings call highlighted strong pharmaceutical performance, driven by new product launches like ZYTIGA, XARELTO, and INVOKANA.  Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue growth in emerging markets and to regain lost OTC market share.  However, concerns about pricing pressures, particularly in the MD&D and diabetes care segments, were noted.  This suggests a mixed short-term outlook for the stock, potentially with some volatility depending on the success of the company's response to the competitive landscape.
