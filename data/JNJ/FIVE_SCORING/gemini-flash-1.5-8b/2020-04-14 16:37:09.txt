Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2020 earnings call highlights significant uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Medical Devices segment, leading to a substantial downward revision in their guidance.  While consumer health and pharmaceuticals showed resilience, the projected decrease in elective procedures is a major concern over the next few weeks. Management appears confident in the long-term prospects and is taking aggressive steps like developing a COVID-19 vaccine.  Therefore, short-term movements of the stock will likely be negatively impacted by the uncertain medical device outlook.
