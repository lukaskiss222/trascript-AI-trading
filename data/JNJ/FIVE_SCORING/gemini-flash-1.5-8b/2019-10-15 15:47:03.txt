Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2019 earnings call highlights strong performance across most segments, particularly in pharmaceuticals (particularly STELARA, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA) and medical devices (particularly interventional solutions).  Management anticipates continued strong growth in 2020, fueled by innovation and operational improvements.  However, the company's future is somewhat overshadowed by ongoing litigation and the impact of generic and biosimilar competition in some areas.  Overall, the short-term outlook suggests a positive impact, but the long-term success may depend significantly on how the company manages external pressures.
