Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2008 earnings call highlighted strong overall performance, exceeding analyst expectations, with record sales and earnings per share growth.  Management emphasized continued cost-cutting and share buybacks.  However, the pharmaceutical segment experienced headwinds from generic competition, particularly impacting Procrit, Risperdal Oral, and PPI medications.  The company's guidance suggests potential for manageable short-term pressures and a commitment to maintaining margin improvements and returning value to shareholders.
