Johnson & Johnson's earnings call highlighted continued strong performance in 2018, exceeding expectations across segments.  Management emphasized the resilience of the Pharmaceutical segment, despite biosimilar competition, and positive growth in Consumer and Medical Devices. Positive guidance for 2019, notably anticipating some pharmaceutical headwinds but still projected sales and EPS growth, suggests a generally optimistic outlook. The anticipated slight slowdown in growth rates compared to 2018, despite continued investments, probably won't negatively impact the stock in the short term.
