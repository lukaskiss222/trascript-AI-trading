Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2014 earnings call indicated strong performance, exceeding analyst expectations, driven primarily by pharmaceutical segment growth (particularly OLYSIO).  Management highlighted new product launches, successful marketing campaigns, and strong market share gains in key therapeutic areas.  While some pricing pressure exists in the medical devices segment,  management projects that this will be offset by strong operational results and continuing growth in the pharmaceutical segment.
