Johnson & Johnson's Q3 earnings report showed mixed results, with solid performance in pharmaceuticals but weakness in consumer and medical devices. The company faces headwinds from pricing pressures, particularly in Europe, and the impact of healthcare reform in the US. Despite these challenges, J&J's pharmaceutical pipeline looks promising, with several key products showing strong growth. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key markets.
