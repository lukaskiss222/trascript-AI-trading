Johnson & Johnson's Q3 earnings call revealed solid financial results, with sales growth of 6.4% and net earnings of $3.3 billion. The company's Pharmaceutical segment saw a decline in operational sales growth due to generic competition, while the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment experienced growth driven by strong performances in several franchises. The Consumer segment also saw strong results, particularly in the skin care and allergy treatment businesses. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue investing in growth initiatives while maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating robust cash flows.
