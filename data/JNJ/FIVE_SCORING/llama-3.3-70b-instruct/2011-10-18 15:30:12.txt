Johnson & Johnson's Q3 earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with solid sales growth but margin pressure due to remediation costs and the inclusion of Crucell. The company's pharmaceutical business performed well, with new product launches showing promise. However, the medical devices business faced challenges, particularly in the U.S. knee market. Despite these headwinds, management expressed confidence in the company's prospects, citing its diversified portfolio and innovation pipeline. The stock is likely to trade neutral in the short term, as the market digests the earnings report and guidance.
