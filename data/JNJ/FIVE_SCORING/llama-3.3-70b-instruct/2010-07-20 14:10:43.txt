Johnson & Johnson's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with the company achieving record sales but facing challenges due to the McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalls, European pricing pressures, and healthcare reform legislation. The revised guidance for 2010 reflects these factors, with an estimated operational sales increase of approximately 1% and EPS growth of 2-4%. While the company is taking steps to mitigate the impact of these challenges, the short-term outlook is uncertain. However, the company's diverse portfolio, robust pipeline, and commitment to investing in growth initiatives position it well for long-term success.
