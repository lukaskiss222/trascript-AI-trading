Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2013 earnings call revealed a strong performance across the enterprise, with operational sales growth of 10% and net earnings of $3.8 billion. The company's pharmaceutical segment drove growth, with new product launches and increased market share. The medical devices and diagnostics segment also saw growth, despite macroeconomic challenges. The consumer segment showed signs of recovery, with increased momentum in returning OTC products to the market.

Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to sustain growth, citing a strong pipeline of new products and a solid financial position. The company raised its operational sales growth guidance for the year to 6-7%, excluding the impact of currency.

Considering these factors, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
