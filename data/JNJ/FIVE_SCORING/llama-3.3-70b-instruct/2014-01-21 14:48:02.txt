Johnson & Johnson's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong performance in 2013, with operational sales growth of 7.7% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.52, up 8.2% from 2012. The company's pharmaceutical segment drove growth, with 12% operational sales growth, while the medical devices and diagnostics segment saw a decline due to pricing pressures and the medical device tax. The consumer segment also performed well, with 2.8% operational sales growth. Management expressed optimism about the company's future, citing its broad base of healthcare offerings, innovation pipeline, and globalization strategy. The company provided guidance for 2014, expecting operational sales growth of 3.7-4.7% and adjusted EPS of $5.70-5.80. Given the strong earnings and guidance, I predict a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
