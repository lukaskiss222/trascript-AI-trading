Johnson & Johnson reported solid fourth-quarter and full-year 2012 results, with strong operational growth in pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The company's pharmaceutical segment saw a 7.1% increase in sales, driven by new product launches, while the medical devices segment grew 13.7% due to the acquisition of Synthes. However, the consumer segment remained challenging, with a 0.4% decline in sales. Management expressed optimism about returning the consumer business to growth, driven by the relaunch of key brands and expansion in emerging markets. The company also provided 2013 guidance, expecting operational sales growth of 5.2-6.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.35-5.45. 

Given the solid results and guidance, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
