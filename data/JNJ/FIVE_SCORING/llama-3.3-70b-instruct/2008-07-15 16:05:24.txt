Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2008 earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with record sales but tempered growth due to generic competition, market declines, and new competition in certain segments. Despite these challenges, the company's diversified portfolio, cost management, and pipeline developments position it for long-term growth. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance and uncertainties around key products, but the company's ability to manage costs and improve margins is a positive sign.
