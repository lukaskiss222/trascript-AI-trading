Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2013 earnings call revealed a solid start to the year, with operational sales growth of 9.8% driven by strong performance in pharmaceuticals and the addition of Synthes to the orthopedics business. Despite some weakness in the medical device market, the company raised its constant currency sales guidance for 2013, citing the breadth of its business and the success of recently launched products. The stock is likely to react positively to the earnings beat and raised guidance, with a potential short-term increase in stock price.
