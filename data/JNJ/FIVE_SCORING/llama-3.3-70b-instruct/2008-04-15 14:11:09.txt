Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2008 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company beating consensus estimates due to the successful launch of ZYRTEC and strong growth in its consumer segment. However, the pharmaceutical segment faced challenges, including generic competition and declining sales of certain products. The medical devices and diagnostics segment also experienced slower growth due to lower sales of drug-eluting stents. Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to its growth strategy, including new product launches and investments in emerging markets. The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, driven by the strong earnings performance and robust pipeline of new products.
