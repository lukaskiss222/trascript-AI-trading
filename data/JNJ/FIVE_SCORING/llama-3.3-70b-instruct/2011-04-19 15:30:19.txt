Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2011 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with solid sales growth in the Pharmaceutical segment and modest growth in the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment, while the Consumer segment continues to face challenges. The company's guidance for 2011 has been revised upward, largely due to favorable currency exchange rates and the impact of the Merck settlement. However, the increased guidance also reflects additional remediation costs and the dilutive effect of the Crucell acquisition.

The company's short-term stock price is likely to be positively impacted by the revised guidance and the favorable settlement with Merck, which is expected to contribute to the company's long-term growth. Additionally, the company's strong pipeline and new product launches are expected to drive growth in the Pharmaceutical segment. However, the Consumer segment's challenges and the uncertainty surrounding the DePuy orthopedics business may temper the stock's upside potential.

Overall, the earnings call suggests that Johnson & Johnson is making progress in addressing its challenges and is well-positioned for long-term growth. The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the revised guidance and the Merck settlement.
