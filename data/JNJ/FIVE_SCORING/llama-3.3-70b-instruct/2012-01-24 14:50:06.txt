Johnson & Johnson's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with solid financial results but also challenges in certain segments. The company's pharmaceutical business is resurgent, driven by new product launches, while the medical devices segment faces continued pressure due to pricing and regulatory issues. Despite these challenges, Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned for long-term growth, with a strong pipeline of new products and a commitment to innovation. The company's guidance for 2012 suggests a modest increase in sales and earnings, withOperating margins expected to improve by 100 to 150 basis points.
