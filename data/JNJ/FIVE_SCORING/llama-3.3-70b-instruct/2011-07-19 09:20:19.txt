Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with sales growth driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices, but facing challenges in the consumer segment due to manufacturing quality issues. The company's guidance remains unchanged, with expected operational sales growth of 2.5-3.5% and EPS of $4.74-4.84. While the call highlighted several positive developments, including new product launches and strategic acquisitions, it also noted continued pressure on pricing and reimbursement. Considering these factors, I predict a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
