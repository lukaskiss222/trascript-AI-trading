Johnson & Johnson’s Q1 2013 earnings call showed strong operational sales growth, driven by the pharmaceutical segment and successful integration of Synthes into their orthopedics business. The 5-7% growth forecast for 2013 was raised, bolstered by a robust pipeline and strategic cost management despite ongoing pressures in certain sectors like medical devices. The commentary from management expressed confidence in the company’s diverse portfolio and ability to continue driving growth, which suggests a positive tone for the stock in the short term.
