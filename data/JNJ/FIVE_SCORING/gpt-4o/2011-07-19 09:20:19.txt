Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2011 earnings call suggests a moderately positive outlook in the short term. The company's revenue surpassed analyst expectations, driven by encouraging sales in key segments, particularly in pharmaceuticals with new product launches like STELARA and ZYTIGA. Though challenges persist, such as remediation costs in the consumer segment and issues in the hip and knee markets, the management's strategy to invest tax savings back into business operations reflects confidence in ongoing growth. These factors, combined with the companyâ€™s maintained guidance, suggest potential positive impacts on the stock in the near term.
