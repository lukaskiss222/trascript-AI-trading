Johnson & Johnson reported strong Q3 2007 results, with worldwide sales up 12.7% year-over-year, aided significantly by the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare. However, the company's adjusted EPS saw only moderate growth at 7%, and there were challenges in its pharmaceutical segment due to generic competition and declining markets for certain products. Notably, the added restructuring charge and a slight decrease in the EPS guidance range reflect the pressures in pharmaceuticals and medical device sectors, complicating the short-term outlook. The mixed signals from solid growth against rising competitive and operational headwinds suggest a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on the stock.
