Johnson & Johnson delivered solid financial results for 2008 despite challenges, including economic pressures and patent losses such as those for Risperdal and Topamax. The company's diversified business strategy and cost management have positioned it to handle anticipated challenges in 2009, although it faces expectations of slower operational growth due to these pressures and macroeconomic conditions. Management's guidance indicates a strategic focus on cost efficiency, product innovation, and potential strategic acquisitions, leveraging its strong cash position. The company's cautious outlook and the expected economic drag suggest limited short-term impact on its stock price.
