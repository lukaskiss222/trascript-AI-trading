Johnson & Johnson's Q2 2012 earnings call reflects a neutral short-term outlook for the stock. The company demonstrated steady performance with operational sales growth but faced challenges from currency impacts and OTC business supply disruptions. The acquisition of Synthes is a positive long-term strategic move, with immediate accretive earnings expected. However, the stock may see limited movement in the short term due to mixed regional performances and ongoing remediation in the consumer segment, suggesting the market may adopt a wait-and-see approach.
