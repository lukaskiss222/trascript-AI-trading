Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2008 earnings call indicates a strong performance, with sales and earnings exceeding analyst expectations. Significant contributions came from the successful launch of ZYRTEC and the growth in their REMICADE business. However, challenges such as the impact of generic competition on key pharmaceuticals and a potential slowdown in procedure volumes in the U.S. were noted. Despite these, the company displayed confidence in its cost management, restructuring efforts, and robust pipeline, suggesting a generally positive short-term outlook, but tempered by existing challenges.
