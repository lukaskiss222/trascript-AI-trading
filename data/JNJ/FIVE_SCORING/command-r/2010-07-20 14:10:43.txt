The short-term impact of Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s Q2 2010 earnings call is negative, reflected in the reduced full-year guidance attributed to challenges in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments. The stock is likely to experience pressure due to product recalls, plant closures, and pricing pressures in Europe affecting the bottom line. The layoffs at the Fort Washington plant further contribute to the negative sentiment. Over the next two weeks, these factors will likely put downward pressure on the stock. [-2]
