The 2014 guidance and Q4 earnings report reveals a well-balanced healthcare giant with strong performance across Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments. The companyâ€™s broad portfolio, robust R&D pipeline and global reach position it well for sustainable growth. Starting with relatively modest projections for 2014, with an average growth estimate, the near term looks healthy. However, some challenges like currency fluctuations, pricing pressures and integration issues could create headwinds. The stock is likely to remain stable, with a slight positive bias, in the short term.
