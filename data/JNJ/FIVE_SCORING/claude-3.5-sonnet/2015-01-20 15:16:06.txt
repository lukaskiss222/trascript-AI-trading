Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on J&J's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While the company reported solid 2014 results, there are several key headwinds that could pressure the stock: significant currency headwinds affecting 2015 guidance, declining OLYSIO sales, biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe, and modest growth expectations in medical devices. The conservative 2015 guidance and underlying growth commentary also suggests limited near-term catalysts despite management's longer-term optimism.
