Based on this earnings call transcript, I expect a moderately negative short-term (1-2 week) impact on Johnson & Johnson's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

Key Negatives:
- Management maintained full-year guidance despite Q2 outperformance, suggesting potential headwinds in H2
- Continued pressure on orthopedic/surgical volumes and pricing
- Slower than expected recovery in consumer segment, particularly OTC
- Higher spending/investment planned for H2 will offset tax rate benefits
- Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties in US and Europe

Key Positives:
- Q2 results beat expectations on both top and bottom line
- Strong pharma pipeline momentum with recent approvals
- Geographic expansion and emerging markets growth 
- Cost control and operational efficiency initiatives

Overall, while the company is executing well strategically, near-term headwinds and increased spending plans are likely to pressure the stock over the next couple weeks. The maintained guidance despite the Q2 beat suggests management sees challenges ahead.
