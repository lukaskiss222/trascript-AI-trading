Based on the earnings transcript, there are several concerning elements that suggest negative short-term pressure on the stock:

1. Reduced guidance due to two major headwinds: 
- $600M impact from McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalls/plant suspension
- $200M impact from accelerating European pricing pressures on pharmaceuticals

2. Multiple operational challenges:
- Quality control issues and FDA scrutiny of manufacturing facilities
- Decelerating growth across 6 of 7 Medical Device & Diagnostic franchises
- Continued pressure on Consumer segment due to recalls and economic factors

3. Management tone was defensive regarding quality issues and conveyed uncertainty around timing of recovery in key segments.

While there are some positives like strong BRIC market growth (16%) and progress on new products, the near-term headwinds from the manufacturing issues and European pricing pressure will likely weigh on the stock over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the reduced guidance and operational challenges.
