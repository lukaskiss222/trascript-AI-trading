Based on the earnings call transcript, J&J delivered solid Q3 2008 results despite economic headwinds. Key positives include strong operational performance across segments, raised full-year EPS guidance, robust pharmaceutical pipeline progress, and maintained financial strength. However, there are some near-term challenges including FX headwinds expected to impact Q4, some pockets of weakness in elective procedures, and manufacturing cost pressures. Management's confident tone about their diversified business model and ability to manage through market volatility, along with their strong balance sheet and cash flows, suggests they are well-positioned to weather current market conditions.
