Based on J&J's Q4 2008 earnings call, here's my short-term analysis:

Mixed signals but leaning negative:

Positives:
- Strong cash position and AAA credit rating
- Cost control measures in place
- Guidance of operating margin improvement in 2009

Key Concerns:
- Significant currency headwinds expected (-4% impact on 2009 sales guidance)
- Major patent expirations (Risperdal, Topamax) impacting 2009 growth 
- Economic pressures affecting elective procedures and consumer spending
- Conservative 2009 guidance: -1% to +1% operational growth

The weak 2009 guidance and multiple near-term headwinds are likely to pressure the stock over the next 1-2 weeks, despite the company's strong long-term positioning.
