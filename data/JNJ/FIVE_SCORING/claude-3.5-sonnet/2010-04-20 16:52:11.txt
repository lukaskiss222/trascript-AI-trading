Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Johnson & Johnson's likely short-term stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong underlying operational growth of ~5% excluding generic impacts and recalls
- Medical device segment showed robust 8% operational growth
- Management maintained full-year EPS guidance despite healthcare reform headwinds
- Consumer business expected to recover from recall impact in coming quarters

Key Concerns:
- $0.10 EPS hit from healthcare reform in 2010
- Currency headwinds impacting guidance
- Consumer OTC recall impacted Q1 results
- Potential pricing pressure in some segments like spine

Overall, while there are some near-term headwinds from healthcare reform and currency, the company demonstrated solid fundamental performance and maintained guidance through operational strength. Management's confident tone and ability to offset challenges through core business performance suggests the stock should see modest upside in the coming weeks.
