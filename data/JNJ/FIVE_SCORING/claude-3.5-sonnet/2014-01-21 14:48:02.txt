Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess Johnson & Johnson's likely stock movement over the next 1-2 weeks as moderately positive. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q4 results with sales up 4.5% and adjusted EPS of $1.24, exceeding analyst estimates
- Pharmaceutical segment showing exceptional growth (11.8% increase)  
- Consumer segment recovery progressing well with 75% of OTC products back on shelves
- Positive outlook for orthopedics business with improving trends
- $4B deal to sell diagnostics business to Carlyle Group

Key Concerns:
- Conservative 2014 guidance of 3.7-4.7% operational growth, below 2013's rate
- Continued pricing pressures expected in Europe
- Currency headwinds from Japanese yen devaluation
- Some integration challenges remaining with Synthes acquisition

Overall, while growth may moderate in 2014, the company demonstrated strong execution across segments in Q4, has multiple growth drivers intact, and maintains a solid financial position. Management's confident tone and commitment to margin expansion should support positive sentiment in the near-term.
