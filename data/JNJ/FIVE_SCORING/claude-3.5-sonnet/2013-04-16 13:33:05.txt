Based on the earnings transcript, I believe J&J's Q1 results and outlook indicate a modestly positive short-term impact on the stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong pharmaceutical performance (8% operational growth ex-adjustments) driven by new products like ZYTIGA and INVOKANA
2. Progress in returning OTC products to market with 14% US growth
3. Raised full-year operational sales guidance despite some market challenges
4. Maintained EPS guidance despite currency headwinds

However, there are some offsetting factors:
- Softer medical device market trends and competitive pressures
- No acceleration in healthcare utilization 
- Currency headwinds impacting reported results

Overall, while not a blowout quarter, the solid results across key business segments and maintained guidance should provide modest support for the stock in the near-term.
