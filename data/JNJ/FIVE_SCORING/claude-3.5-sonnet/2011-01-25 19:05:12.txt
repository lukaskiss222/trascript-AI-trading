Based on my analysis of this extensive earnings call transcript, here are the key points impacting J&J's short-term stock outlook:

Positives:
- Strong pharmaceutical pipeline with multiple new product launches and filings
- Good growth in emerging markets (+14% in BRIC countries)
- Continued financial strength with $14B in free cash flow
- Progress on addressing consumer product quality issues

Negatives:
- Continued headwinds from OTC recalls and remediation costs ($0.06 EPS impact in 2011)
- Increased pricing pressure across businesses, especially in Europe
- Slower procedure volumes in medical devices
- Conservative 2011 guidance below consensus

The company is working through challenges but appears to be managing them appropriately while maintaining investments for future growth. However, the multiple near-term headwinds and below-consensus guidance will likely pressure the stock in the coming weeks.

Rating: [-1]
