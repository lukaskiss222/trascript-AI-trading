Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on J&J's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While pharmaceutical growth was solid at 5.9% and pipeline developments are encouraging, the company faces multiple headwinds including:

1. Continued pressure on medical device procedures/volumes due to economic conditions
2. Pricing pressures in both pharma and devices
3. Ongoing impact from consumer product recalls
4. Lower hospital capital spending
5. European austerity measures impacting pricing

Management's tone was cautious regarding near-term market conditions, particularly around elective procedures and hospital spending. While long-term prospects remain solid, these immediate challenges are likely to weigh on investor sentiment in the very short term.
