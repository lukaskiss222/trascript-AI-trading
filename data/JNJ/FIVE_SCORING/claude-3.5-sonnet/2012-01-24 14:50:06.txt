Based on the earnings call transcript, I would provide the following analysis and rating for J&J's likely stock movement over the next 1-2 weeks:

Analysis:
- Strong underlying performance with sales growth returning in 2011 and adjusted earnings growth for 28th consecutive year
- Robust pharmaceutical pipeline with multiple recent successful product launches (ZYTIGA, XARELTO, etc.) and more coming
- Guidance for 2012 was solid, with 4-5% operational growth expected despite macro headwinds
- Some caution around continued pricing pressure, remediation costs, and currency headwinds
- Management tone was notably confident about having "turned the corner" after recent challenges
- Key OTC products returning to market gradually through 2012
- Balance sheet remains very strong with significant cash position

While there are still some headwinds, the overall tone was quite positive and guidance was in-line to slightly better than expectations. Management conveyed a clear sense of optimism about future growth drivers.

Rating: [1]

The strong pipeline, improving business momentum, and confident management outlook suggest a positive near-term stock reaction, though tempered somewhat by macro challenges and ongoing remediation costs.
