Based on the Q2 earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q2 results with operational sales growth of 10% (5.6% excluding Synthes acquisition)
- Raised full year operational sales growth guidance to 6-7% from previous guidance
- Pharmaceutical segment showing robust growth (+12.9% operational) led by new products
- OTC consumer business continuing recovery with 19.7% growth in U.S.

Key Concerns:
- Medical device segment facing ongoing market/pricing pressures
- Second half implied guidance suggests slower growth vs. first half
- Some uncertainty around China investigations into business practices
- Diabetes care business seeing significant price pressure (-11.8% decline)

Overall Assessment:
The strong Q2 performance and raised guidance should provide near-term support for the stock, outweighing the headwinds in certain segments. Management presented a confident outlook while acknowledging challenges. The diverse business model continues to demonstrate resilience.

In the 1-2 week period following this earnings report, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction.
