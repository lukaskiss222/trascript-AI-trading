Based on the earnings transcript, Johnson & Johnson showed mixed but generally resilient performance in Q1 2009 despite economic headwinds. Key positives include maintained EPS guidance, strong operational earnings growth offsetting currency impact, and cost containment driving margin improvement. However, notable challenges include consumer segment weakness, generic competition impacting pharma sales, and significant currency headwinds. Management expressed confidence in the pipeline and ability to drive growth through new product launches in the second half. Given J&J's diversified business model, strong cash position, and management's confirmed full-year guidance despite a tough Q1, the stock should see modestly positive momentum in the near-term.
