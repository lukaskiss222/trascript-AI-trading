Based on the earnings transcript, Johnson & Johnson delivered a solid quarter with several positive developments that suggest good near-term momentum:

Key Positives:
- Strong pharmaceutical performance driven by new product launches like ZYTIGA and XARELTO
- Successful integration of Synthes acquisition proceeding well
- Continued progress in remediation of consumer business with 75% of brands expected back in market by end of 2013
- Healthy operational growth guidance of 5.2-6.2% for 2013
- Robust performance in emerging markets, particularly China

Some Concerns:
- Medical device pricing pressure expected to impact margins
- New medical device tax headwind in 2013 
- Some supply disruptions and competitive pressures in certain device segments

Overall, the company demonstrated good execution across its businesses and provided a constructive outlook for 2013, despite some known headwinds. The strategic moves like exploring options for the diagnostics business also show proactive portfolio management.

Given the solid Q4 performance, healthy guidance, and multiple growth drivers in place, I expect the stock to react positively in the near-term.
