Johnson & Johnson reported strong first-quarter results, with earnings and sales exceeding expectations, driven primarily by robust pharmaceutical growth, particularly from OLYSIO and INVOKANA. Management provided positive guidance for the year, indicating confidence in continued growth despite minor headwinds from currency fluctuations and pricing pressures.
