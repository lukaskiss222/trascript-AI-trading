Johnson & Johnson reported solid second-quarter results with strong growth in pharmaceuticals and MedTech, maintaining its full-year guidance despite inflationary pressures and ongoing macroeconomic challenges. The successful launch of key products and strategic initiatives, such as the separation of the Consumer Health business, indicate positive momentum. These factors are likely to favorably influence the stock in the short term.
