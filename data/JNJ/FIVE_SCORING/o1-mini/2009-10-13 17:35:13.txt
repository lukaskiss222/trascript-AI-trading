Johnson & Johnson reported mixed third-quarter results with sales declining 5.3% year-over-year, primarily due to lower US sales and unfavorable currency impacts. However, the company managed to stabilize earnings through cost-cutting measures and maintained steady EPS growth, alongside optimistic guidance for full-year performance despite economic uncertainties. The balanced performance is likely to result in a neutral short-term impact on the stock.
