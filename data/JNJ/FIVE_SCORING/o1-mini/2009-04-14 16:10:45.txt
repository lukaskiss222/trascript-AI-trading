Johnson & Johnson reported a slight decline in Q1 2009 sales and flat earnings per share, reflecting economic headwinds and generic competition. However, the management maintained its full-year guidance and highlighted strategic initiatives and a strong pipeline, which could reassure investors. Overall, the mixed results are likely to result in a neutral short-term impact on the stock.
