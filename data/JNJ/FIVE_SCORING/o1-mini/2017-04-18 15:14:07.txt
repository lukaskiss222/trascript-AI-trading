Johnson & Johnson exceeded its adjusted earnings per share estimates and raised its full-year guidance, primarily driven by the anticipated Actelion acquisition and strong performance in its pharmaceutical and medical devices segments. Despite some headwinds in the consumer segment, management's optimism and strategic acquisitions suggest confidence in sustained growth. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
