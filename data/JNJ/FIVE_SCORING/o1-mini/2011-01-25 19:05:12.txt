Johnson & Johnson reported a decline in both sales and earnings, primarily due to OTC recalls and pricing pressures, which could dampen investor sentiment in the short term. Although management remains optimistic about long-term growth and has provided cautious guidance, the immediate reaction is likely to be influenced by the negative quarterly performance. This may result in a temporary downturn in the stock price.
