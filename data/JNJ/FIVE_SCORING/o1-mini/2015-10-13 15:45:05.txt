Johnson & Johnson reported mixed third-quarter results with worldwide sales down 7.4% year-over-year and adjusted EPS decreasing by 7.5%. However, the adjusted EPS surpassed analyst expectations and the announcement of a $10 billion share buyback program indicates confidence in the company's financial health. Overall, these factors suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
