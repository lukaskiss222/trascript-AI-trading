Johnson & Johnson reported solid first-quarter results with operational sales growth of 5.5% globally and increased guidance for operational sales growth. Strong performance in Pharmaceuticals, particularly from DARZALEX and IMBRUVICA, alongside strategic acquisitions and cost-saving measures, indicate positive short-term momentum. Management's confident tone and raised EPS guidance further support a favorable outlook for the stock in the next couple of weeks.
