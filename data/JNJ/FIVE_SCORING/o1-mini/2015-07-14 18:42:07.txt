Johnson & Johnson reported mixed second-quarter results with a year-over-year sales decline driven by currency fluctuations and divestitures, but adjusted earnings per share slightly improved. Management provided optimistic guidance and highlighted strong growth in key segments like consumer and pharmaceuticals, which may balance investor concerns in the short term. Overall, the stock is likely to remain relatively stable.
