### Analysis
The Johnson & Johnson earnings call for the second quarter of 2015 provided a comprehensive overview of the company's performance and strategic direction. Key highlights include:

1. **Financial Performance**: The company reported $17.8 billion in sales for the second quarter, a decrease of 8.8% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to currency impacts and the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Despite these challenges, the company achieved adjusted earnings of $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6.3% compared to the same period last year.

2. **Segment Performance**: The Consumer segment reported sales of $3.5 billion, up 2.3% compared to the same period last year. The Pharmaceutical segment reported sales of $7.9 billion, up 1% compared to the same period last year. The Medical Devices segment reported sales of $6.4 billion, down 4.7% compared to the same period last year.

5. **Divestitures**: The company announced the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health, which is expected to close towards the end of 2015, subject to regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions.

### Short-Term Implications
The short-term implications of the earnings call are mixed. While the company reported a decrease in sales and earnings compared to the same period last year, the adjusted earnings were higher than expected. The company also provided guidance that suggested a solid growth trajectory for the remainder of the year. However, the decrease in sales and earnings was primarily due to currency impacts and the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, which may not be indicative of a long-term trend.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be positive, as the company reported adjusted earnings that were higher than expected. However, the decrease in sales and earnings compared to the same period last year may cause some short-term volatility. The company's focus on innovation and strategic initiatives suggests that the long-term outlook for the company is positive.
