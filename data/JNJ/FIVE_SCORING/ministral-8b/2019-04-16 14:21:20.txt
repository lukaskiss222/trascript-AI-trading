Based on the transcript, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) reported strong first-quarter results with a 0.1% increase in worldwide sales to $20 billion. The company's operational sales growth was 3.9%, driven by a 1.8% increase in the U.S. and a 6% increase outside the U.S. The company's net earnings were $3.7 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39, up 0.5% compared to the same period last year. The company's adjusted net earnings were $5.7 billion, with adjusted EPS of $2.10, up 1.9% compared to the same period last year. The company's adjusted income before tax was consistent with the same period last year, with pharmaceutical margins decreasing by 480 basis points primarily driven by increased investments in R&D spend. Consumer margins improved by 700 basis points, driven by the gain related to the company's earlier investment in Ci:z Holdings. Medical Devices were essentially flat, improving 30 basis points versus last year.

The company's guidance for 2019 was increased by 50 basis points, reflecting full-year adjusted operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and operational sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. The company's expectation for total reported sales in 2019 remains the same, at minus 1.5% to minus 0.5%, utilizing an average euro spot rate of $1.12 versus the $1.14 referenced back in January. The company's expectation for other income, excluding special items, was increased by $400 million to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion for the year. The company's expectation for adjusted operational EPS was increased by $0.03 per share, bringing the midpoint to $8.78 per share. The company's expectation for the negative impact of currency on EPS increased $0.05 and is now estimated to be $0.20 for the year, resulting in adjusted EPS in the range of $8.53 to $8.63 per share.

The company's confidence in its 2019 outlook was bolstered by the strength of its first-quarter results, which elevated its confidence in its performance and enabled it to absorb the impact to EPS of incremental currency headwinds and its investment in Auris Health. The company's higher level of expected other income provides the flexibility to deploy higher levels of investment to fortify and accelerate its pipelines. The company's divestiture of its Advanced Sterilization Products business closed on April 1, 2019, and will have minimal Advanced Sterilization Products sales in the second quarter. The company expects currency to still be a headwind in the second quarter, but not as significant as experienced in the first quarter. The second quarter of 2018 represented the highest sales quarter in the year, so the company expects a more challenging year-over-year comparison, particularly as it expects some of the generic and biosimilar erosion in its Pharmaceutical segment to potentially accelerate.

Overall, the company's strong first-quarter results and increased guidance for 2019 suggest that the stock may experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the company's guidance for 2019 includes a significant negative impact of currency on EPS, which may offset some of the positive impact of the company's increased guidance. Additionally, the company's expectation for the negative impact of currency on EPS is higher than its expectation for the negative impact of currency on EPS in 2018, which may suggest that the company's guidance for 2019 is more conservative than its guidance for 2018. Therefore, while the company's strong first-quarter results and increased guidance for 2019 suggest that the stock may experience a positive impact in the short term, the company's guidance for 2019 includes a significant negative impact of currency on EPS, which may offset some of the positive impact of the company's increased guidance.
