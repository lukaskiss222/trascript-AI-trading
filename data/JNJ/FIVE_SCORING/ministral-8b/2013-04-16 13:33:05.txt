However, the medical devices and diagnostics segment saw a 1.5% decline in sales due to market dynamics and inventory levels.

- **Consumer:** Sales increased by 3.3% driven by OTC medicines and baby care products.
- **Medical Devices and Diagnostics:** Sales declined by 2.4% due to market dynamics, inventory levels, and competitive pressures.
