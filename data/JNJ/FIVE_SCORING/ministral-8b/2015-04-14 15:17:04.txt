Based on the earnings transcript, the short-term implications for Johnson & Johnson's stock are mixed. The company reported strong sales growth in the consumer segment and improved operational earnings, but the impact of currency headwinds and the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics could dampen the stock price. Additionally, the company's guidance for 2015 reflects the impact of these factors, which could lead to a short-term negative impact on the stock price. However, the company's focus on innovation and strategic growth in key markets could provide long-term upside potential. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the headwinds and divestitures, but the company's long-term prospects remain strong.
