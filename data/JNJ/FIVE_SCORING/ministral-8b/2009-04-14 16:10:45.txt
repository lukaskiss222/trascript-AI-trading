Based on the earnings transcript for Johnson & Johnson, the company's first quarter 2009 results were mixed, with sales and earnings declining due to economic factors and generic competition. However, the company's strong financial position and pipeline of new products suggest long-term growth potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. Overall, the stock is expected to have a neutral to slightly positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
