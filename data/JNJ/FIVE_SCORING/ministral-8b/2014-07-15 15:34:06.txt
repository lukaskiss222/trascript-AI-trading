### Analysis

The Johnson & Johnson earnings call for the second quarter of 2014 reveals a strong performance across all segments, particularly in the pharmaceutical and consumer businesses. The company's focus on innovation and strategic growth is evident in the launch of new products and the growth of key brands. The guidance for 2014 reflects a more conservative outlook compared to previous quarters, primarily due to the impact of currency fluctuations and the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (OCD). The company's commitment to innovation and R&D, as well as its strategic positioning in the healthcare market, suggests a positive outlook for the long term. However, the short-term impact on stock price may be influenced by the reduced guidance and the uncertainty surrounding the OCD divestiture.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price of Johnson & Johnson is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the strong performance and the company's continued focus on innovation and strategic growth. The reduced guidance and the uncertainty around the OCD divestiture may cause some temporary volatility, but the long-term prospects of the company remain strong. Therefore, the rating for the short-term impact on the stock price is:

**0**
