### Analysis

The Johnson & Johnson earnings call for the first quarter of 2008 provided mixed signals. The company reported strong financial results with record sales and earnings, highlighting growth in the consumer segment, particularly driven by the over-the-counter (OTC) launch of ZYRTEC. However, the call also touched on challenges such as generic competition in the pharmaceutical segment and a slowdown in procedure volumes in the medical devices segment. While the company maintained a positive outlook, the overall tone was cautious due to the uncertain economic environment and potential headwinds from generic competition.

### Short-Term Implications

1. **Positive Factors**:
   - **Strong Consumer Growth**: The consumer segment saw robust growth, with the OTC launch of ZYRTEC being a significant contributor.
   - **Pharmaceutical Pipeline**: The company highlighted progress in the pipeline with new product launches and regulatory filings.
   - **Cost Management**: The company continues to manage costs effectively and implement cost-saving measures.

2. **Negative Factors**:
   - **Generic Competition**: The pharmaceutical segment faced significant challenges due to generic competition, especially for RISPERDAL Oral.
   - **Procedure Volume Slowdown**: A slowdown in procedure volumes in the medical devices segment was noted, particularly in general surgery.
   - **Economic Uncertainty**: The economic slowdown and uncertainty in credit markets were highlighted as potential headwinds.

### Conclusion

Given the mixed signals and the cautious tone of the call, the short-term impact on Johnson & Johnson's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The company's strong financial results and pipeline progress are positive, but the challenges from generic competition and the economic uncertainty may temper investor sentiment. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these factors.
