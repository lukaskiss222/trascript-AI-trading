### Analysis

Johnson & Johnson's Q4 and full-year results for 2017 were strong, with sales growing 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increasing by 10.1% compared to the same period last year. The company's strong performance was driven by the Pharmaceutical segment, which grew 15.5% excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Medical Devices segment also performed well, with sales growing 6.5%, and the Consumer segment saw a 0.4% increase in sales.

The company's guidance for 2018 projects an operational sales increase of between 3.5% and 4.5%, with an underlying growth excluding acquisitions and divestitures of between 2.5% and 3.5%. The company expects adjusted EPS to grow between 7% and 9.5% on a constant currency basis.

The company's strategic focus on innovation, acquisitions, and portfolio management is evident in its 2017 results and 2018 guidance. The company's strong balance sheet and cash flow position allow it to continue investing in R&D and value-creating M&A.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on Johnson & Johnson's stock price is likely to be positive, given the company's strong Q4 and full-year results and its optimistic guidance for 2018. The company's focus on innovation and strategic growth, as well as its strong balance sheet and cash flow position, should provide support for the stock price in the near term. However, investors should monitor the company's progress in executing its strategic initiatives and the impact of any potential headwinds, such as biosimilar competition for REMICADE and ZYTIGA.
