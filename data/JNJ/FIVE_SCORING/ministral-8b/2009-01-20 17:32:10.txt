Johnson & Johnson's Q4 and full-year results call revealed a mixed bag of performance metrics. The company reported $15.2 billion in Q4 sales, down 4.9% year-over-year, with a net income of $2.7 billion. The company's overall 2008 sales grew 4.3% to $63.7 billion, with EPS increasing 6.8% to $4.55.

The analysts discussed several key points:
1. **Generic Competition**: The company highlighted the impact of generic competition on their pharmaceutical sales, particularly for products like Risperdal and Topamax.
2. **Economic Conditions**: The economic slowdown has led to a slowdown in elective procedures and a reduction in consumer spending on healthcare products.
3. **Acquisitions**: The company mentioned that they were open to acquisitions but were cautious about the high prices and the regulatory challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.
4. **Cost Management**: The company has been successful in managing costs and improving margins, despite the economic downturn.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Johnson & Johnson's stock price is expected to be neutral. The company's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives indicate that they are well-positioned to navigate the current economic challenges. However, the uncertainty around generic competition and the potential impact of the economic slowdown on consumer spending may create some short-term volatility in the stock price.
