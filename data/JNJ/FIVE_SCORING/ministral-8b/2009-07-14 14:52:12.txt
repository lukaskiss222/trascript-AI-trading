The Johnson & Johnson earnings call for the second quarter of 2009 revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported a decline in sales, primarily driven by the loss of exclusivity for RISPERDAL and TOPOMAX, and a reduction in consumer spending. However, the company's operational results were better than expected, with strong growth in several segments, including orthopedics and surgery, and the launch of new products such as Simponi and Nevo. The company's guidance for the full year was maintained, with a range of $63 billion to $64 billion in sales and $4.60 to $4.70 in EPS. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the economic uncertainty and the impact of currency exchange rates, but the company's strong operational results and long-term growth prospects suggest that the stock may rally in the long run.
