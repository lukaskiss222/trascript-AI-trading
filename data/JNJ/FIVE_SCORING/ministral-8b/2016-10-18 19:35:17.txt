The Johnson & Johnson earnings call provided mixed signals for the stock. The company reported strong financial results, with sales and earnings beating expectations, and the guidance for 2016 was maintained. However, the call highlighted concerns about the impact of biosimilar competition on REMICADE and the potential for lower prices. Additionally, the company's strategy to defend REMICADE and maintain growth in the face of biosimilar competition was reassuring, but the uncertainty around the legal process and potential changes in pricing could weigh on the stock. Overall, the call provided a mixed message for the stock, with the potential for short-term volatility due to the uncertainty surrounding biosimilar competition and pricing.
