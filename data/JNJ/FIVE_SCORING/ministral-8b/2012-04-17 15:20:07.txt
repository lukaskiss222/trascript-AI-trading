### Analysis:

The earnings call for Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in the first quarter of 2012 revealed a mixed performance. The company reported a 1% operational growth in sales, driven by strong performance in emerging markets and new product launches. However, the company faced challenges in the U.S. market due to generic competition and the impact of the Consent Decree on the Consumer business. The guidance for 2012 projects a 4% to 5% operational sales increase, with EPS estimates of $5.18 to $5.28 per share. The company also expects to close the pending acquisition of Synthes in the second quarter of 2012, which could have a positive impact on the company's financials. Overall, the call provided mixed signals, with the company facing short-term headwinds but also showing potential for long-term growth.

### Conclusion:

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on J&J's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's guidance for 2012 is in line with expectations, and the pending acquisition of Synthes could provide a positive catalyst for the stock. However, the challenges in the U.S. market and the impact of the Consent Decree on the Consumer business could weigh on the stock in the near term. Overall, the call provided a mixed outlook for J&J, with potential for long-term growth but also short-term headwinds.
