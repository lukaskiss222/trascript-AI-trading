**Analysis:**

Johnson & Johnson's Q4 and full-year 2021 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with sales and earnings growth across all segments. The company's Pharmaceuticals segment delivered a tenth consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth, while Medical Devices and Consumer Health also showed competitive growth. The company's strong financial position allows it to consider strategic acquisitions and investments in innovation. However, the call also highlighted challenges such as supply constraints, inflationary pressures, and the impact of COVID-19 on medical procedures. The company's guidance for 2022 projects operational sales growth of 7.0% to 8.5%, reflecting the ongoing recovery and market recovery in Medical Devices and the expected impact of inflation and supply constraints.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong financial performance and the company's ability to manage through challenges, Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned for 2022. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures, but the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects suggest a positive outlook in the long term. The stock may experience a short-term negative impact due to the uncertainty around the STELARA patent expiration and the impact of COVID-19 on medical procedures.
