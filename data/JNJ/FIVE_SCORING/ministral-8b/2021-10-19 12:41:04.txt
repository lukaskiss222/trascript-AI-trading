### Analysis

Johnson & Johnson's Q3 2021 earnings call highlighted strong performance across its Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses, with solid growth in Medical Devices despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. Key takeaways include:

1. **Pharmaceutical Segment**: Double-digit growth across several key brands, including DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, and STELARA, indicates a robust pipeline and continued demand for these assets.
2. **Medical Devices**: The segment experienced 7% growth in Q3, driven by market recovery and new product introductions. While the Delta variant and hospital shortages impacted growth, the company remains optimistic about the long-term potential of the medical devices market.
