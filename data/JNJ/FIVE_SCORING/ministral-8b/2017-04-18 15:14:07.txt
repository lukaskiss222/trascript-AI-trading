**Analysis:** The earnings call for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in the first quarter of 2017 revealed mixed signals. While the company achieved record annual sales, the lowered 2017 guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts signal short-term headwinds. However, managementâ€™s focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:** The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the tempered guidance and defense market uncertainties. However, the long-term potential for growth in non-defense markets and strategic expansions could provide a positive outlook.

**Rating:** -1
