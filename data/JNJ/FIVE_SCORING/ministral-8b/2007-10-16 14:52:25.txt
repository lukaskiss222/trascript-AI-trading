While the company reported strong sales and earnings, the guidance for 2008 was lower than expected, and there were concerns about generic competition and market pressures in certain segments. The cost-cutting measures and restructuring programs may have a short-term negative impact on the stock, but the company's long-term growth prospects and innovation pipeline could provide support for the stock in the medium term.
