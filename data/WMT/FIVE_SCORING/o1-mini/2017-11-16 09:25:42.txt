Walmart reported strong third-quarter sales growth and a significant increase in eCommerce performance, alongside an upward revision of its full-year EPS guidance. Management's emphasis on cost discipline and strategic investments in online and international markets further supports positive sentiment. These factors are likely to drive a modest positive impact on Walmartâ€™s stock in the short term.
