Walmart reported strong Q3 results with earnings per share and net sales exceeding last year's figures. The raised full-year EPS guidance and positive outlook for the holiday season, along with robust international growth, suggest investor confidence. Despite minor challenges in U.S. comparable sales, the overall management tone remains optimistic, likely leading to a positive short-term impact on the stock.
