Walmart reported solid third-quarter performance with positive comparable sales in the U.S. and strong growth in international markets like Mexico and Canada. While earnings were slightly pressured by significant investments and currency headwinds, the optimistic guidance for the holiday season and continued focus on e-commerce provide positive short-term outlook. Managementâ€™s confident tone and strategic initiatives are likely to support the stock in the near term.
