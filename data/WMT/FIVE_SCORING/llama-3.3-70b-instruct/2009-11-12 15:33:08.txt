Walmart's Q3 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong operating performance, improved inventory management, and a solid financial position. Despite a challenging economic environment, the company gained market share, delivered year-over-year sales and EPS growth on a constant currency basis, and returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Management's focus on growth, leverage, and returns is expected to drive shareholder value, and the company is well-positioned for the holiday season.
