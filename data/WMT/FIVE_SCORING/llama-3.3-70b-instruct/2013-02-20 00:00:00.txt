Walmart's earnings call revealed a solid fourth quarter and full-year performance, with the company delivering a 10.6% increase in earnings per share and a 5% increase in net sales. The company's U.S. segment performed well, with a 1.8% comp sales growth and market share gains in several categories. However, the International segment faced challenges, particularly in the U.K. and Canada, due to a weak consumer spending environment. Despite this, the company remains committed to its strategic priorities, including investing in eCommerce, improving returns in International markets, and driving productivity in its operations. The company's guidance for fiscal 2014 indicates a modest sales growth of 5-6%, with a focus on leveraging expenses and delivering strong returns to shareholders. Overall, the company's performance and guidance suggest a stable and steady outlook, but with some short-term headwinds due to economic uncertainty and competition.
