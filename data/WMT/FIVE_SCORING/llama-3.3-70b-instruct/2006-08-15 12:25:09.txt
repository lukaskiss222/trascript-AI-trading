Walmart's Q2 earnings report showed mixed results, with total sales increasing 11.3% and net income from continuing operations rising 4.6%, but U.S. comp store sales growth was disappointing at 1.7%. The company's guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year was also modest, with expected EPS from continuing operations ranging from $0.59 to $0.63 per share for Q3 and $2.88 to $2.95 per share for the full year. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and sales performance.
