Walmart's Q1 earnings report showed a 6% increase in net sales and a 10.6% increase in operating income, with all segments contributing to the growth. The company's leverage of expenses and strong profitability were notable, despite a decline in US comparable store sales. Management's guidance for the second quarter was modest, citing ongoing economic pressures and deflation. Given the mixed results and cautious guidance, the stock is likely to experience a short-term neutral impact.
