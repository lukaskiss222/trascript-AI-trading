Walmart's Q2 earnings report showed solid results, with a 12.4% increase in earnings per share and a 5.5% increase in net sales. The company's U.S. segment saw improved sales momentum, with a positive comp sales trend in July, while Sam's Club reported its sixth consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. However, the company's guidance for the third quarter was cautious, citing a challenging global economy and potential headwinds from inflation and tobacco sales. Overall, the report suggests that Walmart is well-positioned to navigate a tough economic environment, but may face short-term pressure on its stock price due to tempered guidance and external uncertainties.
