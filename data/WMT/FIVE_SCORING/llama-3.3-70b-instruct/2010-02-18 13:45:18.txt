Walmart's Q4 earnings report showed strong performance, with earnings per share of $1.23, exceeding guidance and consensus estimates. The company's focus on expense management, inventory control, and global sourcing initiatives are expected to drive future growth. However, the first quarter is expected to be challenging due to tough comparisons and deflation. Given the solid underlying performance and strong guidance, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
