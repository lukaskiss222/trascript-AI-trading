Walmart's Q4 earnings call revealed strong sales and earnings performance, with total net sales reaching $106.3 billion and diluted EPS increasing 7.4% to $1.02. The company's focus on price leadership, inventory management, and operational excellence drove its success, and its international operations showed significant growth, particularly in China, Brazil, and Argentina. Despite a challenging economic environment, Walmart's guidance for fiscal 2009 appears optimistic, with expected US comp store sales growth of 1-2% and diluted EPS of $3.30-3.43. The company's efforts to improve operational efficiency, invest in growth initiatives, and return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends position it well for long-term success.
