Walmart's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company beating EPS expectations but facing a tough sales environment, particularly in the US. The company's expense leverage and strong international performance were positives, but the lowered guidance for Q3 and full-year EPS, as well as the challenging US sales environment, are concerns. The company's focus on improving its assortment, pricing, and customer experience are steps in the right direction, but it may take time to see significant changes in comp sales. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and sales headwinds.
