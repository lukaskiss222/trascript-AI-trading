Walmart's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with diluted earnings per share increasing 5.1% to $1.24, but sales below expectations. The company is executing plans to strengthen its top-line performance for the rest of the year, expecting sequential improvement in the back half. Despite a challenging retail environment, Walmart's management is confident in the company's ability to deliver improved sales and expense savings.
