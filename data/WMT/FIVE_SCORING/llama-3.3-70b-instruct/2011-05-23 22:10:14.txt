Walmart's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company beating EPS guidance but reporting negative comp sales in the U.S. segment. However, the international segment and Sam's Club performed well, with strong sales growth and operating income increases. Management's guidance for the second quarter was generally in line with expectations, and the company's focus on leveraging expenses and improving returns is a positive sign. Despite some short-term headwinds, Walmart's long-term growth prospects and commitment to shareholder returns are intact.
