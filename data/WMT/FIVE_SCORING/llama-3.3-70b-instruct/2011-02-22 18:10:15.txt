Walmart's Q4 earnings call revealed mixed signals, with the company achieving record annual sales but missing expectations for U.S. sales. The lowered guidance and reduced sales forecasts suggest short-term headwinds, but management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key sales performance.
