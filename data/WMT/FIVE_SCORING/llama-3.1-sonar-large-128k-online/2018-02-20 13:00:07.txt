Walmart's Q4 FY2018 earnings call revealed several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Mixed Earnings and Guidance**: While Walmart reported solid fourth-quarter results, including a 2.6% increase in U.S. comp sales and 23% growth in eCommerce, the company's adjusted EPS of $1.33 fell short of analyst expectations. The guidance for FY2019, although slightly increased in terms of EPS range ($4.75-$5), includes lower net sales growth due to the closure of Sam's Club locations and the wind-down of the Brazil eCommerce business[3][5].

2. **Operational Challenges**: The eCommerce growth slowdown was partly due to operational issues, such as inventory management during the holiday season. However, management expects eCommerce growth to accelerate to about 40% for FY2019[3][5].

3. **Investments and Cost Management**: Walmart is making significant investments in technology, supply chain, and eCommerce, which may pressure operating expenses but are expected to contribute to long-term growth. The company is balancing these investments with cost management, aiming for slight expense leverage in FY2019[5].

4. **Tax Reform and Capital Allocation**: The benefits from tax reform are expected to provide a cash tax benefit of around $2 billion, which will be used for investments in the business, including higher wages, benefits, and technology. This could positively impact the stock as it demonstrates proactive use of tax savings[5].

Given these points, the stock might experience some short-term volatility due to the mixed earnings and the slight miss on EPS expectations. However, the long-term strategy and investments in eCommerce, technology, and employee benefits suggest a positive outlook.

**Rating: 0**
This rating reflects a neutral short-term impact, as the mixed earnings and slight EPS miss could lead to some immediate volatility, but the overall strategy and future growth prospects should stabilize the stock in the near term.
