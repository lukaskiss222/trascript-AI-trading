The earnings call for Walmart's second quarter of fiscal year 2014 presents a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Sales Below Expectations**: Walmart reported sales that were below expectations, with Walmart U.S. comp sales declining 0.3% and international sales facing challenges due to softer consumer spending and currency fluctuations.
2. **Expense Management and Leverage**: Despite the sales shortfall, the company managed to leverage expenses in some segments, such as Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, but faced challenges in achieving overall expense leverage due to higher costs in international markets and investments in e-commerce and compliance.
3. **E-commerce Growth**: Walmart saw significant growth in e-commerce, with sales growing over 30% globally, but these investments also created short-term financial headwinds.
4. **Guidance Revision**: The company revised its consolidated net sales growth guidance downward to 2-3% for the full year, reflecting softer sales performance and challenging global business trends, including currency impacts.
5. **Compliance and FCPA Costs**: Higher-than-expected costs for FCPA matters and compliance programs will continue to impact earnings in the coming quarters.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the revised guidance, below-expectation sales, and ongoing compliance and e-commerce investment costs.
