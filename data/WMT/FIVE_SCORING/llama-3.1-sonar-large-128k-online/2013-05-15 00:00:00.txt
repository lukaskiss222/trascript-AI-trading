The transcript for Walmart's Q1 FY2014 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

- **Challenging Sales Environment**: The quarter was marked by headwinds such as delayed tax refunds, increased payroll taxes, and unfavorable weather, which impacted top-line sales. However, Walmart U.S. managed to leverage expenses and deliver solid operating profit[5|.
- **Positive EPS Growth**: Despite the challenges, Walmart reported a 4.6% increase in diluted EPS to $1.14, driven by cost management and strategic investments[5|.
- **Strong E-commerce Growth**: E-commerce sales grew more than 30% in the first quarter, indicating positive momentum in this critical area[5|.
- **International Performance**: While Walmart International had respectable top-line growth, operating income declined due to various factors including softer sales, wage inflation, and higher indirect taxes. However, the company is taking actions to improve expense management and productivity[5|.
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided Q2 EPS guidance between $1.22 and $1.27, which is slightly above the previous year's EPS. They also expressed confidence in their long-term strategy and anticipated improvements in the second half of the year[5!.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The company's ability to manage through challenging external factors, maintain solid EPS growth, and show strong e-commerce performance are positive indicators. However, the challenges in international operations and some short-term expense pressures might temper the immediate upside.
