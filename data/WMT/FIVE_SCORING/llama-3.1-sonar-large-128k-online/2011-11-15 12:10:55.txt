### Positive Factors:
- Walmart reported earnings per share within guidance and exceeded comp sales expectations for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club.
- The company saw strong sales growth internationally, with a 20.3% increase in net sales for Walmart International.
- Operating income grew 4.8% overall, and the company leveraged operating expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales.
- Strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet position were highlighted.
- The company is well-positioned for the holiday season with various price investment strategies, layaway programs, and improved merchandise assortment.
