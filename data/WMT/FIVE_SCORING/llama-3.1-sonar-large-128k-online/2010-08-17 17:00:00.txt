The earnings transcript for Walmart Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 presents several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Positive Earnings and Guidance**: Walmart reported EPS of $0.97, a 9% increase over the previous year, and raised full-year EPS guidance to $3.95 to $4.05. This suggests strong earnings growth and management confidence[3].

2. **Expense Leverage and Operational Efficiency**: The company achieved expense leverage for the third consecutive quarter, which contributed significantly to the bottom line results. This indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency[3].

3. **International Growth**: Walmart International delivered strong growth, with net sales up 11% and operating income up 16.8%, highlighting the segment's robust performance[3].

4. **Challenges in U.S. Segment**: While Walmart U.S. faced challenges, including flat sales and a 1.8% decline in comps, the new leadership and strategies aim to improve top-line sales by the fourth quarter. This suggests potential for future improvement but may not immediately impact short-term stock performance[3].

5. **Strong Balance Sheet and Returns to Shareholders**: The company maintained a strong balance sheet, returned $5.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, and reported healthy free cash flow of $4.5 billion for the first half of the year[3].

Given these points, the overall tone is positive, driven by strong earnings, international growth, and efficient operations. However, the challenges in the U.S. segment might temper immediate enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings, raised guidance, and efficient operations, despite some challenges in the U.S. segment.
