The Walmart earnings transcript for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 presents several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

## Strong Sales and eCommerce Growth
Walmart reported broad-based growth, with consolidated net sales up 3.8% and Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales growing 50%. This robust growth, especially in eCommerce, is a positive indicator[3,.

## Margin Pressure and Cost Management
Despite the strong sales, Walmart faced gross margin pressure due to price investments, mix effects from eCommerce, and hurricane-related expenses. However, the company is focused on managing costs and improving efficiency, which could mitigate some of the margin pressures in the future[3,.

## Positive Comp Sales and Traffic
Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.7%, with traffic up 1.5%, and Sam's Club comp sales also showed strong growth. These metrics indicate a healthy core business and customer response to Walmart's initiatives[3,.

## Guidance and Outlook
The adjusted EPS guidance was increased to $4.38-$4.46, and fourth-quarter comp sales are expected to grow between 1.5% and 2%. This positive outlook suggests continued momentum into the next quarter[3,.

## Macro and Competitive Environment
Walmart's performance was somewhat insulated from broader economic concerns, and the company continues to execute its pricing strategy and expand its online grocery pickup and delivery services, which are attracting new customers and retaining existing ones[3,.

Given these points, the overall tone of the transcript is positive, highlighting strong sales growth, improving operational efficiency, and a promising outlook. However, margin pressures and the ongoing need to manage costs are noted as areas of focus.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong sales growth, increased guidance, and the company's strategic initiatives in eCommerce and grocery services.
