Walmart's third-quarter earnings call for fiscal 2011 presented several positive and some mixed signals that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Signals:
- Walmart reported solid EPS growth, with earnings per share of $0.95, exceeding the adjusted $0.82 from the previous year, helped by a tax benefit of $191 million[5|.
- The company saw a 2.6% increase in net sales to $101.2 billion, driven significantly by international sales which were up 9.3%[5|.
- Operating income grew 3.1% over last year, meeting the goal of growing operating income faster than sales[5|.
- Expense leverage was maintained for the fourth consecutive quarter, and the company increased its full-year EPS guidance[5|.
- Strong performance in international markets, particularly in China, Japan, and the U.K., and positive sales momentum at Sam’s Club[5].

### Mixed Signals:
- Wal-Mart U.S. comp store sales declined 1.3% for the 13-week period, although this was within guidance[5|.
- Inventory growth outpaced sales growth, which could pressure free cash flow in the fourth quarter[5|.
- Sam’s Club experienced a decrease in operating income due to higher expenses, despite strong sales momentum[5%.

### Conclusion:
Given the overall strong financial performance, increased guidance, and positive international and Sam’s Club results, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. However, the slight decline in U.S. comp store sales and inventory management issues might temper some of the enthusiasm.
