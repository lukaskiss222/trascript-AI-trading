The earnings transcript for Walmart Inc. for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 presents several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Earnings and Operational Performance**: Walmart reported earnings per share of $1.23, exceeding both its own guidance and the First Call consensus estimate. The company also achieved record profits, strong free cash flow of $14.1 billion, and a pre-tax return on investment of 19.3% for the year[1][4].

2. **Challenges in US Comparable Store Sales**: Despite the overall strong performance, Walmart US comparable store sales were below expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to deflation in grocery and electronics. However, the company is optimistic about improving sales as the year progresses[1][4].

3. **International Growth and Efficiency**: Walmart International showed significant growth, with sales up 11.9% on a constant currency basis and operating income growing faster than sales. The segment also made progress in reducing inventory and improving returns[4].

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2011, which is in line with current First Call estimates. They expect comparisons to get easier as the year progresses, despite initial challenges due to deflation and strong year-over-year comparisons[4].

Given these points:

- The strong earnings and operational metrics, including high free cash flow and solid ROI, are positive indicators.
- The challenges in US comparable store sales, while a short-term concern, are mitigated by the company's optimistic outlook for the rest of the year.
- The strong international performance adds to the overall positive sentiment.
