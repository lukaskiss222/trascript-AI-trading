The transcript for Walmart's third quarter of fiscal year 2013 presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Walmart reported an 11.3% increase in EPS, with net sales up 3.4% and consolidated operating income up 4%.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The company achieved operating leverage despite various headwinds, including costs related to FCPA matters and superstorm Sandy.
- **Segment Performance**: Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club showed solid comp sales growth, while Walmart International faced some challenges but still managed to grow market share in most markets.
- **Holiday Season Preparation**: The company is well-prepared for the holiday season, with robust inventory, strong marketing plans, and competitive pricing strategies.
- **Guidance**: The guidance for the fourth quarter is positive, with expected EPS ranging between $1.53 and $1.58, and full-year EPS guidance tightened to $4.88 to $4.93.

However, there are some potential short-term headwinds, such as ongoing expenses related to FCPA matters, the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, and competitive pressures during the holiday season.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, operational efficiency, and optimistic holiday season outlook.
