The earnings transcript for Walmart Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Positive EPS and Comp Sales**: Walmart exceeded both EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance, with EPS of $0.98 and a 1% increase in Walmart U.S. comp sales, driven by solid traffic growth. This positive performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors[1][5].

2. **Strong E-commerce Growth**: Although global e-commerce sales growth was not as strong as desired, the U.S. e-commerce segment showed better growth, and the expansion of services like Grocery Pickup and Walmart Pay indicate promising initiatives. These developments could support long-term growth expectations[1][5].

3. **International Performance**: Walmart International had a strong start, with positive comp sales in most markets, despite challenges in the UK and other regions. This mixed performance might not significantly impact the overall positive outlook[1][5].

4. **Cost Management and Price Investments**: The company demonstrated improved cost management and initiated additional price investments, which could enhance customer satisfaction and drive future sales growth. However, these investments might temporarily affect margins[1][5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting improvements in store experience, customer satisfaction, and strategic investments in e-commerce and technology. These factors are likely to support the stock price in the short term.
