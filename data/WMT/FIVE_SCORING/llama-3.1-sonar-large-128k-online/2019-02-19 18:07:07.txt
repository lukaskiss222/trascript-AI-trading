The transcript for Walmart's Q4 FY2019 earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: Walmart reported lower-than-expected earnings per share but saw strong sales growth, particularly in eCommerce, which was up 43% in the quarter. This mixed performance could lead to a neutral to slightly positive reaction from investors[3][5].

2. **Strong Operational Metrics**: Despite some challenges, Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 4.2%, and eCommerce sales showed significant growth. These positive operational metrics are likely to be viewed favorably by investors[3][5].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: Walmart reaffirmed its FY2020 guidance, which includes expected sales growth and some margin pressure due to the inclusion of Flipkart. The guidance suggests a stable outlook, which might not significantly move the stock either way[3][5].

4. **Investment in eCommerce and Technology**: The company's continued investment in eCommerce, grocery pickup, and delivery, along with technological improvements, indicates a long-term focus on growth. However, these investments are expected to increase eCommerce losses in the near term, which could temper short-term enthusiasm[3][5].

Given these points, the overall impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive in the short term, as investors balance the strong operational performance and long-term growth initiatives against the near-term challenges and increased eCommerce losses.
