- **Operational Efficiency**: Walmart U.S. leveraged operating expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales, and the company generated strong free cash flow of $12.7 billion[1][3].
- **eCommerce Growth**: Significant investments and growth in eCommerce, with online sales contributing to sales growth and market share gains in key markets like the U.S., U.K., Brazil, and China[1][4].
- **Guidance**: Fiscal 2014 guidance indicates expected sales growth between 5% and 6%, with EPS expected to be between $5.20 and $5.40, including increased costs for eCommerce operations[3].

### Challenges:
