- **Inventory Management**: Walmart US and Samâ€™s Club both achieved significant inventory reductions, which contributed to improved financial results and customer experience[4|.
- **Expense Management**: The company demonstrated disciplined expense management, with operating expenses increasing only 2.4% despite various headwinds. The focus on cost savings and productivity initiatives is expected to continue[4|.
- **Guidance Update**: The full-year earnings guidance was updated to $3.50 to $3.60 per share, slightly narrowing the range, and the FX impact expectation was reduced from $0.13 to $0.11 per share[4|.
