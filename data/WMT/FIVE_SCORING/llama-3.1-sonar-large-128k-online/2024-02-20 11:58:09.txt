3. **E-commerce and Delivery Growth**: Walmart's e-commerce sales surged 23% globally, with store-fulfilled delivery services playing a significant role in this growth. This trend is expected to continue, driven by improvements in delivery speed and fulfillment efficiency[1][3][4%.

4. **Advertising and Membership Growth**: Global advertising revenue grew 33%, and membership programs, such as Walmart+, continue to see double-digit growth, contributing significantly to the company's profitability[1][3][4].

5. **Operational Efficiencies and Automation**: Walmart has made significant progress in supply chain automation and inventory management, leading to lower markdowns and improved gross margins. These efficiencies are expected to continue benefiting the company in FY2025[1][3][4].
