The transcript of Walmart's Fiscal Year 2021 First Quarter Earnings Call indicates several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the company's stock price:

## Strong Operational Performance
- Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Walmart reported strong sales growth, with U.S. comp sales increasing by 10% and eCommerce sales growing by 74%. This robust performance is likely to be viewed positively by investors.

## Omnichannel Strategy
- The company's omnichannel strategy, including the expansion of pickup and delivery services, has been highly effective, attracting new customers and increasing customer loyalty. This strategic execution is a positive indicator for future growth.

## Financial Discipline
- Walmart maintained financial discipline by managing expenses well, despite higher operational costs related to the pandemic. The company's ability to leverage expenses and maintain a strong financial position is a positive sign.

## Uncertainty and Withdrawn Guidance
- The decision to withdraw FY '21 financial guidance due to uncertainty around the pandemic's impact and other external variables introduces some uncertainty. However, the company's strong business fundamentals and financial position mitigate some of this uncertainty.

## Short-Term Headwinds
- There are short-term headwinds, including ongoing costs related to the pandemic, such as additional sanitation and associate support, which may continue into Q2. However, these costs are being managed within the context of overall business operations.

Given these factors, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting Walmart's strong operational performance, effective strategy execution, and financial discipline. However, the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its ongoing impact introduces some caution.

### Conclusion
