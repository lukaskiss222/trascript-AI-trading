The earnings transcript for Walmart Inc. for fiscal 2014 presents a mixed picture that is likely to have a short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

### Positive Factors
- Walmart reported a 30% growth in global e-commerce sales, exceeding $10 billion, which is a significant positive indicator for the company's future growth in the digital space[4].
- The company saw strong performance in small format stores, with plans to accelerate their rollout, which is expected to drive retail growth.
- Walmart U.S. gained market share across several general merchandise categories during the holiday season, and the e-commerce business contributed positively to overall sales.
- Membership income at Samâ€™s Club grew significantly, driven by a fee increase and new member services.

### Negative Factors
- Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by 19.8% for the fourth quarter and 3.2% for the full year, largely due to discrete items such as Brazil non-income tax contingencies, employment claim contingencies, and other international challenges.
- Consolidated net sales growth was only 1.6% for the year, and constant currency net sales would have increased 2.5% if not for significant currency exchange rate fluctuations.
- Operating income decreased 14.4% for the fourth quarter and 3.1% for the full year, influenced by various discrete items and increased expenses.
- The company faced significant headwinds from severe weather, reduced government benefits, and a challenging global economic environment, which impacted comp sales and operating performance.

### Guidance and Outlook
- For fiscal 2015, Walmart expects net sales growth to be at the low end of the 3-5% range due to ongoing economic and currency challenges. The company also anticipates higher health care benefit utilization and increased investments in e-commerce, which could impact earnings.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the disappointing earnings performance, lower-than-expected sales growth, and the continued challenges in various international markets.
