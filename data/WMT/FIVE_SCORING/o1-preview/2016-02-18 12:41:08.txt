Walmart's earnings call revealed that while the company continues to see positive same-store sales growth in the U.S., their operating income has decreased due to significant investments in wages and store closures. Additionally, the guidance for fiscal year 2017 indicates a decline in earnings per share, which may concern investors. These factors are likely to exert short-term downward pressure on the stock price.
