Walmart reported solid third-quarter earnings with an EPS of $1.08, an 11.3% increase over last year and within their guidance. However, the company cited ongoing headwinds such as expenses related to FCPA investigations, cautious consumer spending, and challenges in international markets like China and Brazil. While they slightly tightened full-year EPS guidance, the lack of significant upward revision and the mention of persistent challenges suggest the stock may face short-term pressure.
