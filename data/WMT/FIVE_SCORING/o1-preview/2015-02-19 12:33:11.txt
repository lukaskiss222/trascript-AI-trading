Walmart reported strong fourth-quarter results, with better-than-expected comp sales and positive momentum in its U.S. stores. However, the company's guidance for lower earnings per share in fiscal 2016, due to significant investments in wage increases and anticipated currency headwinds, may concern investors in the short term. As a result, the stock price is likely to face negative pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
