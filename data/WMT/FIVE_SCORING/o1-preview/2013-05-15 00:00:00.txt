Walmart reported lower-than-expected sales growth and a decline in same-store sales, impacted by factors like delayed tax refunds, unfavorable weather, and increased payroll taxes. Operating expenses grew faster than sales in the international segment, and the company did not leverage expenses as planned. While eCommerce growth was strong, the overall negative top-line performance and margin pressures suggest the stock may face short-term downward pressure.
