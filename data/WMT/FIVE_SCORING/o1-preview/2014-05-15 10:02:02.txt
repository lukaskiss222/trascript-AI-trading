Walmart's Q1 earnings call highlighted challenges such as severe weather affecting U.S. sales, higher operating expenses, and earnings per share at the low end of guidance. While management remains confident in long-term strategies and noted growth in e-commerce and international markets, the short-term outlook is tempered by ongoing headwinds like increased health care costs and cautious Q2 guidance. As a result, the stock is likely to experience a slight negative impact in the short term.
