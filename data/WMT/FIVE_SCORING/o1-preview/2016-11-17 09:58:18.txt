Walmart reported solid third-quarter results, raising the lower end of its full-year EPS guidance and demonstrating strong momentum in e-commerce with over 20% growth, bolstered by the Jet.com acquisition and strategic partnerships in China. Positive same-store sales in both the U.S. and international markets, along with improvements in customer traffic and online grocery services, position the company favorably for the holiday season. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock price in the short term.
