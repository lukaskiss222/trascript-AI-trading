Walmart reported better-than-expected EPS and comp sales growth, indicating strong performance in core retail operations. Improvements in cost management, inventory control, and positive customer feedback reflect successful initiatives. While rising operating expenses due to wage increases and slower e-commerce growth are concerns, the overall positive results are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
