Despite reporting record sales and earnings, Walmart acknowledged softer-than-expected U.S. sales, with same-store sales up only 1.5%. However, the company's aggressive pricing strategies for the holiday season, strong international performance, and initiatives like the $4 generic prescription drug program are poised to boost customer traffic and sales. These factors suggest a potential positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
