Walmart's earnings call highlighted concerns over decreased profitability despite modest sales growth. The lowered full-year EPS guidance, ongoing margin pressures from higher expenses, lower pharmacy reimbursements, and increased shrink are likely to negatively affect investor sentiment in the short term. As a result, the stock may face downward pressure over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
