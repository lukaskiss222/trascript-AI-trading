Walmart reported better-than-expected EPS and solid sales growth, with strength in International operations and Sam's Club. While U.S. same-store sales were slightly negative, they were within guidance, and management indicated that their plans to improve U.S. performance are gaining traction. The positive earnings surprise and encouraging guidance are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
