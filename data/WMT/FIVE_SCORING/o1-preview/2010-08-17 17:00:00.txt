Walmart exceeded earnings expectations for the quarter, reporting an EPS of $0.97 versus the consensus of $0.96, and raised full-year EPS guidance to $3.95â€“$4.05. Despite flat sales and declining comps in the U.S. segment, strong international growth and effective expense management drove overall positive results. The market is likely to respond positively to the earnings beat and raised guidance in the short term.
