Walmart's Q2 earnings call indicated challenges ahead, with the company lowering its full-year EPS guidance due to higher-than-expected healthcare costs and increased investments in e-commerce and customer service. Despite growth in net sales and e-commerce, flat U.S. comp sales and operating income pressure raise concerns. The lowered guidance and expense pressures are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term.
