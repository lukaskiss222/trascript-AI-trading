Walmart reported strong Q2 earnings, exceeding expectations with an EPS of $1.18 and raising full-year guidance. The company's U.S. operations showed continued momentum with positive comp sales and effective cost management, leading to operating income growing faster than sales. Despite currency headwinds and moderated international growth plans, the positive earnings surprise and increased guidance are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock.
