Walmart reported strong second-quarter results, exceeding expectations and raising the lower end of its full-year EPS guidance. The company demonstrated robust growth in e-commerce, with U.S. GMV up 67%, and sustained positive comp sales in both domestic and international markets. Management's optimistic tone, solid execution of strategic initiatives, and improved store performance suggest the stock will likely experience a positive impact in the short term.
