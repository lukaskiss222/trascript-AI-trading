Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Walmart's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $3.95-$4.05, demonstrating confidence in future performance despite challenges.

2. Strong expense management led to three consecutive quarters of expense leverage, showing operational efficiency.

3. International segment showed robust performance with 11% sales growth and operating income growing faster than sales.

However, some headwinds exist with U.S. same-store sales declining 1.8%, though management expects improvement by Q4. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with demonstrated strength in cost control and international operations offsetting domestic challenges.
