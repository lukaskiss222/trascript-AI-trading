Based on this earnings call transcript, there are several concerning signals for Walmart's short-term stock performance. Key points include:

1. Reduced full-year guidance from $3.15-3.23 to $3.05-3.13 per share
2. Challenging macroeconomic conditions affecting core markets (US, Mexico, Canada)
3. Margin pressure from price leadership initiatives and markdowns
4. Continued weakness in higher-margin categories like apparel and home goods

While there are some positives (strong Sam's Club performance, international growth), the reduced guidance and acknowledgment of widespread economic pressures affecting their core customer base suggests negative short-term stock movement.
