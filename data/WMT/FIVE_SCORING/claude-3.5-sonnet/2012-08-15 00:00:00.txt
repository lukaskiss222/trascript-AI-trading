Based on this extensive earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Walmart's short-term (1-2 weeks) stock outlook:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong Q2 EPS of $1.18 at top of guidance
- Walmart US delivered 4th consecutive quarter of positive comps (+2.2%)
- Increased full-year EPS guidance to $4.83-$4.93
- Operating leverage achieved across segments
- Strong Sam's Club performance with operating income up 10.1%

Minor Concerns:
- International square footage growth reduced from 30-33M to 21-23M sq ft
- Some currency headwinds impacting international results
- Drought concerns for potential food inflation

The overall tone is very positive, with strong fundamental performance across segments and increased guidance. Management appears confident about maintaining momentum into Q3. The consistent execution of their strategies and focus on price leadership position them well in the current economic environment.

Given the strong results, guidance raise, and continued operational improvements, I expect a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
