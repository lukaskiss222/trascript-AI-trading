Based on Walmart's earnings transcript, here's my short-term price impact analysis:

The company reported solid performance with 9.5% sales growth and 11.2% EPS growth for the fiscal year. While facing some headwinds from higher interest expenses and delayed Easter timing, several positives stand out:

1. Strong execution on inventory management and expense control
2. Continued expansion with aggressive store growth plans
3. International growth through strategic acquisitions
4. Maintained price leadership while improving customer experience

Though guidance was slightly conservative due to interest expense impacts, the overall operational performance and strategic initiatives suggest positive momentum.
