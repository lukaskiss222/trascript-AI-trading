Based on the earnings call transcript, Walmart demonstrated strong performance and positive momentum across its key segments. The key positives include:

1. Walmart U.S. achieved positive comps (+1.3%) ahead of schedule
2. Sam's Club delivered exceptional performance with 5.7% comp sales growth
3. International segment showed solid growth with 20.3% sales increase
4. Company successfully leveraged operating expenses across all segments
5. Strong position heading into holiday season with clear pricing strategy and inventory readiness

While there are some minor headwinds (inflation pressures, traffic challenges in some international markets), the overall tone is very positive with strong execution across segments and encouraging momentum heading into Q4. The management's confidence in holiday season performance and pricing strategy suggests continued strength.
