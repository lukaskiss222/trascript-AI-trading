Based on the earnings call transcript, Walmart demonstrated solid performance with mixed signals for short-term stock movement. Positive factors include: beating EPS guidance ($0.98 vs expected range), continued expense leverage for six consecutive quarters, strong international growth, and Sam's Club outperformance (4.2% comp sales vs 1-3% guidance). However, concerning factors include: ongoing negative comps at US stores (-1.1%), inflation pressures, high gas prices affecting customer behavior, and inventory increases. The guidance for next quarter ($1.05-1.10) suggests steady but not explosive growth.
