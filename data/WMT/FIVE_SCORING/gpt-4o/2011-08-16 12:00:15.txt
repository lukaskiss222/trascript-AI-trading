Walmart’s Q2 FY2012 earnings call presented strong results with a notable 12.4% increase in EPS to $1.09, aligning with top guidance. Despite flat U.S. comp sales, the company's international and Sam's Club operations showed robust growth, contributing to a 5.5% increase in net sales. Management’s commitment to Everyday Low Prices (EDLP) and strategic investments in international markets forecast continued positive momentum. The upbeat report and raised full-year EPS guidance suggest a short-term positive impact on Walmart’s stock.
