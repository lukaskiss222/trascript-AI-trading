Walmart reported a strong third quarter with broad-based growth, including a notable 50% increase in U.S. eCommerce sales and an upward revision of full-year EPS guidance. While gross margins faced pressure partly due to price investments and hurricane impacts, the company’s sales momentum, especially in food and health and wellness, appears solid. Management communicated confidence in their eCommerce strategy and overall performance, which should bolster investor sentiment. These factors suggest a positive near-term outlook for Walmart’s stock.
