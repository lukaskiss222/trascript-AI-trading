Walmart's Q3 earnings call reflects positive momentum and strategic progress, notably in e-commerce and international growth. The company's investments in digital platforms like Jet.com and strategic partnerships such as JD.com are contributing to improved e-commerce performance and market expansion. Additionally, international operations are showing strong comp sales growth despite currency impacts, and the guidance increase for FY2017 EPS suggests confidence in future performance. These factors combined suggest a likely positive short-term impact on Walmart's stock price.
