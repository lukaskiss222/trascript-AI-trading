Walmart's earnings call for Q3 fiscal 2011 highlights overall positive financial performance with increased EPS driven by sales growth across its segments, particularly International, and strategic initiatives in the U.S. While comp sales for Walmart U.S. slightly declined, plans for improvement and expected positive comps in Q4 mitigate concerns. Key emphasis on maintaining low prices during the holiday season and positive international expansion, especially in China and India, suggest that the stock may positively react to the earnings news in the short term, supported by raised full-year EPS guidance.
