Walmart's Q1 FY2018 results reveal a strong start with notable growth in both the physical and digital aspects of the business. The 69% increase in U.S. e-commerce and solid performance across key international markets highlight resilience despite challenges such as delayed tax refunds. The company's strategic focus on integrating digital and physical shopping experiences, as well as maintaining strong store performance, is likely to positively influence investor sentiment and drive slight upwards momentum in the stock price in the short term.
