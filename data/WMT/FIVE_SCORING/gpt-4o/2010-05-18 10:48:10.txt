Walmart's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 highlighted strong financial performance, with EPS exceeding guidance and robust sales, especially in the International segment. The company achieved a notable 6% increase in net sales and emphasized expense management, investing in price leadership to maintain growth. However, the flat performance in U.S. operations and mixed comp sales due to economic pressures like high unemployment and gas prices suggest challenges. Overall, while there are positive global prospects, short-term U.S. concerns might temper stock movement.
