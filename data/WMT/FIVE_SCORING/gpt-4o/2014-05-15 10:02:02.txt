Walmart's Q1 FY2015 earnings call highlighted several challenges, including weather-related impacts and higher-than-expected tax rates, but also showcased positive growth in international sales and e-commerce. The company's strategic emphasis on integrating digital and physical retail, price leadership, and small store expansion plans signals strong long-term growth potential. However, near-term challenges such as flat U.S. comp sales expectations and operational cost pressures may weigh on the stock, suggesting a neutral or slightly negative short-term outlook.
