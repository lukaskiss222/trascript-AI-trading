Walmart reported strong earnings for Q2 2013, with diluted EPS at $1.18, the high end of guidance, showing an 8.3% increase from the prior year. Walmart U.S. demonstrated sustained growth with a 2.2% comp sales rise, marking four consecutive quarters of positive results, suggesting continued domestic momentum. However, international challenges, currency headwinds, and ongoing FCPA expenses may introduce volatility. Despite these challenges, the strong U.S. performance and strategic focus on cost efficiency and eCommerce suggest a neutral to positive short-term impact on the stock.
