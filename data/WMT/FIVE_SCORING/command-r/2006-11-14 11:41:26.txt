Walmart's Q3 results showed encouraging gross margin improvement and continued strong performance in its international segment. However, soft US sales and a lackluster outlook for Q4 comp sales (projected 1â€“2% increase) due to last year's high hurricane-related sales are concerning. The management's focus on price leadership and operational efficiencies is positive, but the stock is likely to face pressure in the short term.
