Walmart's Q2 results showed disappointing sales growth in the U.S., but strong international performance, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. The company's focus on transforming its U.S. business and its efficient inventory management are positive signs. However, the U.S. market's response to higher fuel and energy prices and its impact on customers' shopping patterns are concerns. Walmart's guidance for Q3 is modest, and the stock is likely to consolidated in the short term.
