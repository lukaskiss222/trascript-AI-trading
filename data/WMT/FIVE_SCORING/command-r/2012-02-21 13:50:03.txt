Walmart's Q4 and FY2012 results showcase improved performance across all segments, with particular strengths in International and Sam's Club operations. The company's focus on price leadership and increased assortment, along with efficiency improvements, yielded positive comps and traffic in Walmart US. Strengthening its global position, Walmart International's sales grew, and Sam's Club maintained its momentum with strong membership and sales growth. However, rising fuel costs, inflation, and soft business member sign-ups present challenges. Walmart's efficient operations and commitment to expense reduction and strategic investments are commendable, but increased competition and a cautious outlook for the economy prove concerning. Overall, the stock may face slight pressure due to tempered expectations and a complex operating environment.
