Walmartâ€™s Q3 earnings call for FY 2011 revealed mixed results. While the company improved its full-year EPS guidance, international sales growth was strong, and Wal-Mart U.S. expects positive Q4 comp sales, several downsides exist. Issues like inventory management challenges, increased unemployment insurance taxes, and an uncertain external economic environment for the core customer base suggest short-term headwinds. Despite these challenges, the strategic initiatives and focus on everyday low prices could mitigate some impacts.
