Walmart's fiscal 2013 results showed solid earnings growth, but the Q4 performance was mixed with challenges in some key segments. While U.S. operations grew comp sales and managed to leverage operating expenses, international sales and Sam's Club experienced short-term pressures from price investments and economic conditions. In the short term, the stock might experience volatility due to tempered 2014 guidance and ongoing investments in e-commerce, potentially overshadowing the positive financial outcomes of the past year.
