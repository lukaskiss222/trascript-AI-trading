The Walmart third quarter 2013 earnings call indicates a vibrant company with robust financial performance, particularly on the EPS, which was within guidance and showed an 11.3% increase over last year. The company's strategic focus on expense control, improved profitability, and providing value during economic uncertainty suggests a positive outlook. However, continued pressures on inflation/deflation, economic softness, and the expansion costs inherent in global operations might temper immediate stock price reactions. The lowered guidance for Sam's Club's operating income growth for the fourth quarter could introduce some short-term uncertainty, although the overall strong performance and strategic initiatives are likely to maintain a generally positive to neutral impact on the stock.
