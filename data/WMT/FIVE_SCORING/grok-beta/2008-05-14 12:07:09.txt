Wal-Mart Inc.'s Q1 earnings for FY 2009 surpassed expectations, with significant increases in net sales and earnings per share, as well as strong comparable store sales growth. However, the company anticipates ongoing challenges such as high transportation costs, economic uncertainties, and the housing market's impact on some segments, which could temper stock price growth in the short term. Despite these headwinds, positive customer traffic, price leadership, and inventory management signal a cautiously optimistic outlook.
