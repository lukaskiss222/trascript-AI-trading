Walmart's Q4 2010 earnings results exceeded expectations, but the short-term impact on the stock might be tempered by some challenges. The EPS guidance for Q1 and the full year is in line with consensus estimates, which suggests cautious optimism but not necessarily significant immediate upward movement. While the company demonstrated solid cost control, inventory management, and strong international growth, concerns include a challenging retail environment, deflationary pressures, and uncertainty about consumer spending. However, the initiatives like EDLP rollouts, global sourcing, and operational efficiencies could potentially stabilize the stock price in the near term.
