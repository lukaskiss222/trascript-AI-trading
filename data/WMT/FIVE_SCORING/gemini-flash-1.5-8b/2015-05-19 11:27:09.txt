Walmart's Q1 2016 earnings call highlights continued investments in associates, technology, and e-commerce.  While the company met EPS guidance, currency fluctuations and lower food inflation negatively impacted performance.  Management is optimistic about long-term growth but acknowledges challenges in certain areas like Sam's Club and potential headwinds from currency and the competitive landscape.  The stock's likely short-term impact will be neutral to slightly negative, reflecting the mixed signals and acknowledgment of ongoing pressures.
