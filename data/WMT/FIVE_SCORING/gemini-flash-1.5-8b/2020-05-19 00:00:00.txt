Walmart's Q1 earnings call highlights strong sales growth driven by a dramatic shift to e-commerce and increased demand for essential goods.  Management attributed this to customer stockpiling and the surge in home-based activities, along with stimulus spending. However, mix shifts toward lower-margin categories and higher operating costs impacted gross margins.  Notably, the company withdrew guidance due to the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on consumer habits, economic stimulus, and market trends.
