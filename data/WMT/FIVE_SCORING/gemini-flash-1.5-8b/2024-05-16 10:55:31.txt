Walmart's Q1 FY25 earnings call highlighted strong performance exceeding expectations, driven by sales growth (5.7% constant currency) and adjusted operating profit growth (12.9% constant currency).  Management emphasized value pricing strategies, improved customer experience scores, and continued growth in e-commerce, advertising and membership.  This positive outlook, coupled with continued share gains, suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
