Walmart's earnings call highlighted strong top-line sales growth, exceeding expectations, but lower-than-expected profitability.  Management attributes the shortfall to factors like unexpected associate return from COVID leave, higher-than-anticipated general merchandise inventory, and surging fuel costs.  While management remains confident in the long-term strategy and future growth, the near-term stock impact will likely be negative due to the profit miss and ongoing inflationary pressures.
