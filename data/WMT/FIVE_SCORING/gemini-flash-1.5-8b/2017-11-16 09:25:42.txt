Walmart's earnings call highlights strong performance, especially in the US and Sam's Clubs, with a 3.8% increase in consolidated net sales (constant currency).  Management attributes the growth to broad-based initiatives like price investments, eCommerce growth (50% increase), and a surge in traffic in some areas benefiting from hurricanes. While gross margins were impacted, management is emphasizing cost discipline and efficiency initiatives as keys to performance in the future.  The positive guidance (increased adjusted EPS projections for 2018)  suggests a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
