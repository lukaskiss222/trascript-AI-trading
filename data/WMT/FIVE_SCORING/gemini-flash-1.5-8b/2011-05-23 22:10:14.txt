Management highlighted strong performance in international markets, particularly Mexico, China, and Chile, and positive momentum at Sam's Club.  However, the U.S. comp sales were slightly below expectations, and the call contained projections of continued inflationary pressures and economic headwinds impacting customers â€“  these factors will likely affect the 1-2 week stock price reaction.
