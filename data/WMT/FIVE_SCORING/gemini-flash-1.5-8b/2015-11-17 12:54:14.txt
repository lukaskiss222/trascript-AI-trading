Walmart's earnings call indicates continued investment in associates and technology, impacting short-term operating income.  Positive comp sales and traffic growth in the US, coupled with sustained international expansion, suggest the company is executing its strategic plan, however, currency headwinds and tough comparisons in the fourth quarter create short-term uncertainty.  Overall, the likely short-term impact on the stock is mixed, with potential for a slight dip but also the longer-term positive implications of the strategic direction.
