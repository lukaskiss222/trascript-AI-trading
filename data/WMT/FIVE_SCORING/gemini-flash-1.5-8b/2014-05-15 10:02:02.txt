Walmart's Q1 2015 earnings call presented a mixed outlook.  While the company saw some positive trends in international markets and e-commerce, severe weather negatively impacted U.S. sales and operating expenses.  Management's guidance for the second quarter is cautiously optimistic, but highlights ongoing investments in e-commerce and a focus on price, which could pressure near-term earnings as they ramp up these initiatives.
