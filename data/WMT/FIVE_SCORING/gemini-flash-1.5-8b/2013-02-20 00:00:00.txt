Walmart's earnings call highlights strong financial performance in fiscal 2013, exceeding expectations in many areas.  While the company's growth outlook for fiscal 2014 is slightly tempered compared to the prior year, management is focused on continued investment in eCommerce, a key long-term driver.  The projected increases in capital expenditures and new store openings suggest continued expansion, likely driving short-term stock price appreciation as investors seek retailers with strong growth prospects.
