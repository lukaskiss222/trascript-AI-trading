Walmart's Q2 2021 earnings call highlights strong sales growth driven by increased time spent at home, stimulus spending, and robust e-commerce performance.  Management expresses confidence in the omnichannel strategy and points to improving profitability in e-commerce while acknowledging challenges with inventory and potential slower-than-normal back-to-school sales as temporary headwinds.  Notably, Walmart is not providing future guidance, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in the economic climate.
