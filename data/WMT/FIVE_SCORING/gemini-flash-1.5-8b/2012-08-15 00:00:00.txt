Walmart's earnings call highlighted continued strength in the U.S. business, with positive comp sales for four consecutive quarters.  International sales, though impacted by currency fluctuations, also showed positive growth in several key markets, particularly the UK.  Management presented a cautious yet optimistic outlook for the short-term, forecasting modest earnings growth, though with an emphasis on ongoing price investment.  This combination of positive near-term performance in key areas and a clear ongoing commitment to price suggests limited significant short-term stock price movement.
