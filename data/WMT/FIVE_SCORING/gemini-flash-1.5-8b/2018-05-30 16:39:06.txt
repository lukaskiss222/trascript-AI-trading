The shareholder meeting focused primarily on director elections and compensation, with several shareholder proposals failing to gain majority support.  While the company's executive compensation was approved, proposals regarding chairman independence, racial/ethnic pay gap reporting, and associate stock buyback distribution were voted down.  This suggests continued resistance from shareholders regarding  critical governance and social issues, potentially impacting investor sentiment in the short term.
