Walmart's Q1 earnings show continued strong performance, driven by robust sales growth across all segments, especially in the US and, to a lesser extent in the International markets, where the impact of recent divestitures is noticeable.  Management anticipates continued growth in the second half of the year, influenced by the improving economic conditions and potential for further consumer spending.  The companyâ€™s focus on expanding capacity, particularly for supply chain and delivery, positions them favorably for future growth, though uncertainties regarding the pandemic's ongoing effects remain.
