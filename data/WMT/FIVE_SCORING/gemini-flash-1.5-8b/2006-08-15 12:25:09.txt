Walmart's earnings call indicates a short-term positive outlook, despite some pressure points.  Strong international sales and a consistent focus on value pricing suggest continued market share gains. However, the softening of weekly traffic in the U.S. and increased expenses related to store remodeling could put downward pressure on U.S. comp sales figures in the near term.  Investor sentiment may be affected by the revised guidance for U.S. comp store sales.
