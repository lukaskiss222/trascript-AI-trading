Walmart's earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, exceeding expectations on EPS and free cash flow.  Management cited successful expense management and inventory control as key drivers.  However, the call also acknowledged the challenging economic environment, particularly for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, with lower-than-expected comp sales due to deflation.  This suggests short-term pressure on the stock price, but the optimistic guidance and strong management commentary might limit the negative impact.
