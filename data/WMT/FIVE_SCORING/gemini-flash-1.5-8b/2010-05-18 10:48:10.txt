Walmart's Q1 2011 earnings exceeded expectations, with EPS coming in $0.03 above guidance and consensus.  Management highlights strong expense management and positive growth in international sales. However, US comparable sales were below guidance due to economic pressures on customer traffic. The company is taking action by reincorporating items and emphasizing price leadership, but the short-term impact on the stock remains uncertain given the continuing macro headwinds affecting customer behavior.
