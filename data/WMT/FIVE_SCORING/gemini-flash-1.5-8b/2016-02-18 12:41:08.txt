Walmart's earnings call highlights significant investments in associates, technology, and e-commerce, but also acknowledges near-term pressures from store closures and deflationary trends in key product categories.  While positive traffic and comp sales growth in the US suggest a strong underlying business,  the expected expense headwind from higher wages and store closures will likely weigh on short-term profitability and EPS, especially in Q1 2017.  This, combined with the challenging economic environment in certain international markets, suggests a potentially muted short-term stock price reaction.
