Based on the earnings transcript, Walmart's first-quarter results were mixed, with a 4.6% increase in diluted earnings per share, but sales were pressured by delayed tax refunds and weather. The company's operational performance was solid, with Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club both leveraging expenses and growing operating income faster than sales. However, the international segment faced challenges, with operating income declining and expenses growing faster than sales. The company's guidance for the second quarter was also impacted by currency fluctuations and the ongoing FCPA matters. Overall, the earnings call highlighted the challenges Walmart faces in the current environment, but also the company's commitment to growth and cost management.
