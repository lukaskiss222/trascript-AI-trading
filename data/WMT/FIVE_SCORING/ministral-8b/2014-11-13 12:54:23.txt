### Analysis:
The earnings call for Walmart Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 revealed mixed signals. While the company reported solid earnings per share of $1.15 and a positive comp for Walmart U.S., there were several headwinds, including SNAP-related headwinds and deflation in key categories. Management highlighted areas for improvement, such as enhancing the customer experience and improving price leadership. However, the guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year was revised downward, reflecting the challenges in the U.S. market and international operations. Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to its strategic initiatives, including investments in e-commerce and international expansion. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and market uncertainties.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the revised guidance and ongoing market challenges. The company will continue to face headwinds from SNAP reductions and deflation in key categories, which may weigh on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
