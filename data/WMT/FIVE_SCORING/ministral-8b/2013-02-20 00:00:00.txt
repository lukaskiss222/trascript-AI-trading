The earnings call for Walmart Inc. in fiscal year 2013 highlighted several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported strong financial results, with a 10.6% increase in earnings per share, driven by a 5% increase in net sales to $466.1 billion. The company also increased its annual dividend by $0.29 to $1.88 per share for fiscal 2014. However, the company's guidance for fiscal 2014 was more conservative, with net sales expected to increase 5% to 6%. Additionally, the company expects its effective tax rate to be between 32% and 33% for the year. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
