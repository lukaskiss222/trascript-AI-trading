**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Walmart Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results. While the company reported strong sales and operating income growth, it also faced challenges such as deflation and currency exchange rate fluctuations. The management provided optimistic guidance for 2011, highlighting their focus on growth, leverage, and returns. However, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the economic uncertainty and the company's continued focus on cost-cutting measures.
