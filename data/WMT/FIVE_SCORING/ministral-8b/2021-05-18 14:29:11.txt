**Analysis:**
The earnings call for Walmart Inc. revealed strong Q1 results, driven by robust sales and profit growth. The company's optimism is higher than at the beginning of the year, with improved execution and increasing customer traffic. However, the pandemic continues to present challenges, particularly in certain international markets. The company's focus on strategic growth initiatives, such as Walmart Connect, marketplace, and fulfillment services, is expected to drive future growth. The updated guidance for the full year reflects the strong Q1 performance and a potentially better second quarter than previously expected. Despite the uncertainties related to the pandemic and inflation, the company's financial strength and competitive position are expected to support its stock price over the next 1–2 weeks.

**Conclusion:**
The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be positive, driven by the company's strong Q1 results and updated guidance. The positive sentiment around the company's strategic growth initiatives and competitive position is likely to support the stock price over the next 1–2 weeks.
