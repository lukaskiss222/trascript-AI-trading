### Analysis

Walmart's Q1 earnings call revealed mixed signals. The company reported strong sales growth of 0.8% despite a challenging winter weather environment. However, the company's operating expenses were higher than expected due to severe weather and tax rate fluctuations, leading to EPS of $1.10, which was at the low end of guidance. The company's e-commerce business continued to grow strongly, with sales up 27% on a global basis. Management highlighted the company's focus on expanding price leadership, improving operational efficiency, and growing its e-commerce capabilities.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the higher-than-expected operating expenses and tax rate, but the strong e-commerce growth and management's long-term strategy suggest long-term potential. The stock is expected to remain volatile in the short term, but investors should watch for any further updates on the company's e-commerce initiatives and cost-saving measures.
