### Analysis

Walmart's Q2 2013 earnings call revealed a strong performance with positive comp sales and growth across all key segments. The company's focus on Every Day Low Prices (EDLP) and operational efficiency has driven robust results, particularly in the U.S. and international markets. However, the impact of currency fluctuations and the ongoing FCPA investigation are potential headwinds. The guidance for the third quarter and full year is optimistic, with EPS projections above last year's performance. The stock is expected to perform well given the company's strong fundamentals and strategic initiatives, particularly in eCommerce and international expansion.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be positive, driven by the company's strong performance and optimistic guidance. The stock is likely to see a bullish trend in the next 1-2 weeks.
