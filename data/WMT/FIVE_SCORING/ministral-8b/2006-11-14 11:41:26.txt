The earnings call for Walmart Inc. revealed mixed results for the third quarter, with U.S. comparable store sales (comps) growing by 1.5% but falling short of expectations. The company's gross margin improved, and operating income increased by 13 basis points as a percentage of sales. However, the impact of last year's hurricanes and higher interest rates contributed to the soft sales performance. Despite these challenges, Walmart's strong marketing and pricing strategies, particularly for the holiday season, are expected to drive growth in the fourth quarter. The company's international segment also performed well, with sales and operating income growing at a faster rate than expected. Overall, while the third quarter results were mixed, the company's outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year remains positive, with expectations for U.S. comps to increase by 1% to 2% and earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.88 and $0.92 for the fourth quarter.
