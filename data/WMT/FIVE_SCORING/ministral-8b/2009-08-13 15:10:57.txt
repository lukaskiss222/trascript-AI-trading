Based on the earnings transcript, Walmart Inc. reported mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. The company's net sales were down 1.4% compared to last year, driven by currency exchange rate fluctuations, lower fuel prices, and deflation in certain categories. However, the company's operating income grew by 1.2%, and its diluted net income per share was $0.88. The company also reported strong inventory management, with inventory down 4.3% on a year-to-date sales decrease of 1%. The company's free cash flow was $4.2 billion for the first half of the year, and its return on investment was 18.4%.

The company's guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was between $0.78 and $0.82 per share, and its full-year guidance was updated to $3.50 to $3.60 per share. The company also expects to generate $4.2 billion in free cash flow for the full year.

Overall, the company's performance was mixed, with some positive aspects such as strong operating income growth and inventory management, but also some headwinds such as currency exchange rate fluctuations and lower fuel prices. The company's guidance for the third quarter and full year was also updated, reflecting the company's expectations for the remainder of the year.

Based on this information, the short-term impact on Walmart Inc.'s stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the company reported mixed results but also provided updated guidance for the remainder of the year. The company's strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation also provide some support for the stock price. However, the company's performance in the second quarter and the current economic conditions may continue to put pressure on the stock price in the short term.
