**Analysis:**

The second quarter earnings call for Walmart Inc. revealed mixed performance, with total sales up 8.8% but underlying operating performance below expectations. The company highlighted challenges in the US market due to economic pressures and a slowdown in housing, as well as softness in international markets like Mexico and Canada. Despite these challenges, Walmart's management expressed confidence in their ability to improve performance in the second half of the year through better merchandising, store execution, and inventory management. The company also announced a $15 billion share repurchase program, indicating a focus on shareholder value. The overall tone was optimistic, with management emphasizing their commitment to staying ahead of change and delivering low prices to consumers.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on Walmart's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong sales growth and optimistic guidance, coupled with a share repurchase program, should provide some support to the stock. However, the challenges in the US market and the slowdown in international sales may cause some temporary uncertainty. Overall, the company's focus on cost control and strategic growth initiatives should help to mitigate any short-term headwinds.
