**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Walmart Inc. revealed mixed results, with strong sales growth and improved margins, but also increased expenses and challenges from higher fuel prices and utility costs. The company's focus on transformation and customer experience, as well as strategic expansions in international markets, suggests long-term growth potential. However, the short-term outlook is tempered by the impact of rising expenses and the potential for further pressure on savings from inventory management and wage programs. The stock may face short-term volatility due to these factors.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Walmart's stock price is likely to be **neutral** (0), given the mixed performance and the company's focus on long-term growth strategies.
