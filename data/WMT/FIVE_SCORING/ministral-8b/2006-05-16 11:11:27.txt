Based on the earnings call transcript, Walmart Inc. reported strong Q1 results with record sales and earnings, driven by improved inventory management and cost reduction efforts. The company also highlighted positive international growth, particularly in Mexico and China. However, the company expects higher gasoline and utility prices to pressure its results in Q2. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and higher fuel costs, but long-term growth prospects remain intact.
