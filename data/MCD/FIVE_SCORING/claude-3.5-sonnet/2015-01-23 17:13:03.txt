Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis:

Key Positives:
- Implementing strategic changes like "Create Your Taste" customization platform
- Cost-cutting initiatives and reduced CapEx spending
- Strong franchise system and global infrastructure

Key Negatives:
- Significant sales pressure expected to continue in H1 2015
- Q4 and full year 2014 results missed expectations 
- Ongoing challenges in major markets (US, Europe, Japan)
- Negative comp sales trends continuing into January

The tone of management was notably cautious, emphasizing that 2015 will be a "rebuilding year" with continued pressure on sales and earnings, particularly in the first half. While they outlined various strategic initiatives, most appear longer-term in nature with limited near-term catalysts. The significant headwinds in key markets combined with management's conservative outlook suggest continued pressure on the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
