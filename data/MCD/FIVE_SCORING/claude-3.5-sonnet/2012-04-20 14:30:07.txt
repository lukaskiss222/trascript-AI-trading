Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for McDonald's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong global comparable sales growth of 7.3%
- Continued market share gains across regions
- Solid execution of strategic initiatives (menu optimization, modernization)
- Strong financial position and continued shareholder returns

Key Concerns:
- Margin pressures from rising commodity costs (especially in US)
- European economic headwinds and consumer confidence issues
- More limited pricing power in key markets
- Higher G&A spending expected in upcoming quarters
- Currency headwinds expected to impact earnings by $0.05-0.07 per share in Q2/Q3

Overall Assessment:
While McDonald's fundamentals remain strong, the combination of cost pressures, European challenges, and currency headwinds will likely constrain stock performance in the next 1-2 weeks. The company's guidance suggests lower operating income growth compared to recent years. However, the magnitude of negative factors appears modest relative to McDonald's competitive strengths and global diversification.
