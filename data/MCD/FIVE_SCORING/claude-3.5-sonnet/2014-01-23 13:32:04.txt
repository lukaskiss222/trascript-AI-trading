Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for McDonald's short-term stock impact:

Key Negatives:
- Weak comparable sales growth (flat to negative in major markets)
- Continued margin pressure from higher costs and weak sales
- Execution challenges with new product rollouts
- Ongoing struggles in key markets like Germany and Japan

Key Positives:
- Dollar Menu and More meeting expectations with margin benefits
- Strong cash flow generation and $5B planned return to shareholders
- Strategic investments in kitchen equipment and digital initiatives
- Management appears to have clear plan to address challenges

The overall tone was cautious but constructive. While near-term headwinds persist, management demonstrated a solid understanding of their challenges and outlined specific actions to improve performance. However, the lack of clear catalysts for sales improvement in the next 1-2 weeks suggests limited upside.
