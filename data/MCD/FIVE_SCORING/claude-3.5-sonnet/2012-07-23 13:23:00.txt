Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my short-term stock price analysis:

The earnings reveal concerning headwinds:
- Slowing global comparable sales growth (3.7% vs higher historical levels)
- Increased focus on value/promotional offerings impacting margins
- Rising commodity and labor costs pressuring profitability
- Management lowered full-year operating income growth guidance below 6-7% target

However, some positives exist:
- Continued market share gains despite economic challenges
- Strong franchise model generating significant cash flow
- Strategic investments in remodels and new units continuing
- Management demonstrating proactive cost management

The negative factors, particularly slowing sales growth and margin pressure, are likely to overshadow the positives in the near-term. The stock is likely to face moderate selling pressure over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the lowered guidance and ongoing challenges.
