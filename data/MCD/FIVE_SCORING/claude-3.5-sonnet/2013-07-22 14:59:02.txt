Based on this earnings call transcript, McDonald's is facing several near-term headwinds that will likely pressure the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks:

Key negatives:
- Global comparable sales were soft at +1% and expected to be flat in July
- Management guided to "challenged" results for remainder of 2013
- Reduced CapEx guidance and store opening plans
- Margin pressure from higher costs and limited pricing power
- Weak consumer spending and competitive pressures in most major markets

Some positives:
- Still gaining market share in most markets
- New products meeting/exceeding targets
- Maintaining strong cash flow and returns to shareholders
- Management executing well on cost controls
- Strong franchise model providing stability

However, the cautious outlook and admission of continued challenges ahead will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the near-term. The stock appears poised for modest downside pressure over the next couple weeks as the market digests the softer guidance.
