Based on analyzing the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on McDonald's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong global comparable sales growth of 5% and continued momentum into October (4-5% expected), demonstrating resilient demand despite economic headwinds.

2. Management struck a confident tone about their ability to manage through inflationary pressures while maintaining growth through pricing power and operational efficiency.

3. Continued expansion plans and reinvestment in remodels/modernization indicate confidence in future growth, while maintaining strong cash returns to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

While some margin pressure exists from commodity costs, the company's strong top-line growth, global diversification, and ability to take strategic pricing actions while maintaining traffic suggest the stock should respond favorably in the near-term.
