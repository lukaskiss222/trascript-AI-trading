Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on McDonald's stock price for these key reasons:

1. Strong global performance with comparable sales up 6%, operating income up 11%, and momentum continuing into October with 5-6% expected global sales growth. The company is taking market share across major markets despite challenging conditions.

2. Successful execution of key growth initiatives including new premium beverages (smoothies, frappes) exceeding expectations, restaurant reimaging programs showing good returns, and strong performance in emerging markets like China (12.7% comp sales growth).

3. Management demonstrated confidence in their ability to manage through cost pressures and upcoming challenges (European VAT increases, commodity inflation) while maintaining margins through pricing power and operational efficiencies.

The overall tone was very positive, with management emphasizing continued momentum across regions and their ability to perform well in any economic environment. Near-term headwinds appear manageable within their business model.
