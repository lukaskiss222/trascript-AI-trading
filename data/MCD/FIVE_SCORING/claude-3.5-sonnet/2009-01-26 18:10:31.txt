Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on McDonald's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong global comparable sales growth (7.2% for Q4, 6.9% for full year) with positive momentum continuing into January across all regions, demonstrating resilience in challenging economic conditions.

2. Management effectively managing costs and margins despite commodity pressures, with combined operating margins increasing 320 basis points to 27.4% in 2008.

3. Clear execution of strategic initiatives including McCafe rollout, value menu optimization, and continued international expansion, particularly in China where they plan 175 new restaurants in 2009.

The company demonstrated strong fundamental performance and effective navigation of economic headwinds while maintaining growth initiatives. Management's confident tone and specific plans for continued expansion suggest positive momentum.
