Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for McDonald's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q4 performance with 4.2% comparable sales growth
- 32 consecutive months of positive global comparable sales
- Aggressive $1B share repurchase planned for Q1 2006
- Strong franchise margins increasing nearly 100 basis points
- Clear strategy around refranchising and developmental licensing to improve profitability

Key Concerns:
- Some weakness in European markets, particularly UK
- Higher costs for beef, utilities, and labor impacting margins
- Share count not declining despite buybacks due to option exercises
- Competitive pressures in QSR segment increasing

The overall tone from management was confident and the company demonstrated strong execution of its "Plan to Win" strategy. The significant buyback plan and strong operational metrics suggest positive momentum heading into 2006.

Given the solid performance, clear growth strategy, and aggressive capital return plans, I expect a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
