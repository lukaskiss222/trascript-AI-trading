Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on McDonald's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The key factors driving my assessment:

Negative factors:
- Global comparable sales declined 1% in Q1, with weakness across all major regions
- April sales are expected to be "slightly negative" despite easier comparisons
- Margins are under pressure in all regions due to higher costs and negative comps
- Ongoing macro challenges in key markets (Europe austerity, US slow recovery)

Mitigating factors:
- Market share gains in most major markets despite industry weakness
- Strong product pipeline with new platforms like McWraps
- Management confident in strategic initiatives and long-term outlook
- Disciplined capital allocation and strong balance sheet

While McDonald's remains fundamentally sound, the near-term sales/margin pressures and cautious April outlook will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the immediate term.
