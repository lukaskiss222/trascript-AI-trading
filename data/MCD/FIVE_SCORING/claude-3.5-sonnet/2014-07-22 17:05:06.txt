Based on the earnings call transcript, McDonald's is facing significant challenges. Key concerns include:

1. Declining comparable sales (flat globally, -1.5% in US) and negative guest counts
2. Execution challenges in key markets like US, Germany, and Japan
3. Delayed turnaround timeline with benefits now pushed to 2015
4. Operational reset still in progress with uncertain timeline for improvement
5. Rising costs (labor, commodities) pressuring margins

While management outlined plans around digital engagement, menu customization, and brand trust, the near-term outlook appears challenging with July comps expected to be negative. The company's turnaround initiatives will take time to implement and show results.

Given the continued negative sales momentum, delayed recovery timeline, and margin pressures, I expect a negative short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price.
