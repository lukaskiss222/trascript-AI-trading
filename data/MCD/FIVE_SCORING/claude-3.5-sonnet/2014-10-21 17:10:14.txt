Based on the earnings call transcript, I project a negative short-term impact on McDonald's stock price for the following reasons:

1. Significant operational challenges were reported including declining global comparable sales (-3.3%), operating income down 14%, and EPS down 28% in constant currencies.

2. Management acknowledged continued pressure in Q4 with negative October comps expected and no clear timeline for recovery in key markets like China (6-9 months estimated for normalization).

3. While management outlined various strategic initiatives (menu simplification, digital investments, experience upgrades), these are longer-term solutions that won't immediately address current sales and profit pressures.

The measured but clearly negative tone from executives and multiple acknowledgments of ongoing challenges suggest the stock will face downward pressure in the near term as the market digests these results and waits for signs of operational improvement.
