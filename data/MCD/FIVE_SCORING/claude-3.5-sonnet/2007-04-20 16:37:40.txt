Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for McDonald's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong Q1 results with EPS up 27% YoY
- Robust comparable sales growth across regions (US +4.4%, Europe +8%, APAC +8.5%)
- Expanding margins in most markets despite cost pressures
- Successful new product launches and menu innovation
- Strategic development license transaction in Latin America to improve returns

Key Minor Concerns:
- Some US margin pressure from minimum wage increases and healthcare costs
- Slightly higher commodity costs expected for chicken
- Capital structure questions from analysts suggesting potential for more leverage

Overall Assessment:
The company shows strong operational momentum across all major markets, solid execution of growth strategies, and effective cost management. Management's confident tone and detailed plans for continued growth suggest the positive trajectory should continue in the near-term. The development license transaction also demonstrates strategic focus on improving returns.

Rating: [1]
(Positive impact expected on stock price over next 1-2 weeks, though not dramatic enough to warrant highest rating given some cost pressures and already strong YTD performance)
