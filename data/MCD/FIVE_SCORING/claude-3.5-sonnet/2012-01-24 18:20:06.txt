Based on this earnings call transcript, McDonald's demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Robust global comparable sales growth of 7.5% in Q4 (highest in 7 years) with momentum continuing into 2012
2. Strong performance across all major markets including US, Europe and APMEA despite economic headwinds
3. Successful menu innovations and value offerings driving traffic
4. Continued expansion and reimaging plans showing confidence in future growth
5. Management's confident tone about navigating challenges while maintaining growth

However, there are some watchouts:
- Higher commodity costs expected, particularly in first half of 2012
- Currency headwinds projected for 2012
- Economic uncertainties in Europe
- Higher G&A spending planned for 2012

Overall, given the company's strong operational execution, global momentum, and management's confident outlook despite known headwinds, I expect a positive short-term stock impact.
