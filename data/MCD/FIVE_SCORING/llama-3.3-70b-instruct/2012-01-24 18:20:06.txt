McDonald's strong Q4 and full-year earnings demonstrate the resilience of the company's global business, with system-wide sales increasing 7% in constant currencies and global comparable sales up 5.6%. The company's ability to drive positive comparable sales and implement strategic menu price increases, while maintaining a strong value proposition, has allowed it to navigate challenging market conditions. With a focus on optimizing the menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to the brand, McDonald's is well-positioned for continued growth. The company's plans to invest $2.9 billion in capital expenditures, including opening over 1,300 new restaurants and reimaging over 2,400 existing locations, will further enhance its competitive advantage.
