McDonald's first-quarter results were mixed, with global comparable sales down 1% and operating income flat in constant currencies. While the company outperformed the competitive set in several key markets, including the U.S., persistent expense pressures and negative comparable sales contributed to a decline in combined operating margin. The company's guidance for April sales is slightly negative, and margins are expected to continue to be pressured throughout 2013. However, management remains confident in the company's long-term strategies and its ability to navigate the challenging environment.
