Despite facing significant challenges in 2014, including underperformance in the US business and supplier issues in APMEA, McDonald's is taking steps to regain momentum. The company is focusing on reigniting growth in key markets, strengthening value offers, and pursuing growth opportunities in areas like digital and mobile ordering. While near-term pressure on sales and margins is expected, especially in the first half of 2015, management's actions to refocus on customers, simplify the menu, and enhance the overall experience are likely to drive long-term growth.
