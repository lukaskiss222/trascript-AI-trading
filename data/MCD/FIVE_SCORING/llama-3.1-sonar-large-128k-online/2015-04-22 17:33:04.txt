The transcript of McDonald's Q1 2015 earnings call reveals several key points that suggest a mixed and challenging outlook for the short term:

1. **Negative Sales and Guest Traffic**: Global comparable sales decreased by 2.3%, with significant declines in APMEA (8.3%), the U.S. (2.6%), and weaker results in Europe, particularly in France and Russia[1][2][3].
2. **Strategic Charges and Restructuring**: The company incurred $195 million in strategic charges related to restaurant closings, refranchising, and restructuring, which negatively impacted earnings per share[1][2][3].
3. **Turnaround Plan**: McDonald's is developing a comprehensive turnaround plan, with initial details to be shared on May 4, 2015. This plan includes simplifying the menu, enhancing customer experience, and leveraging digital engagement[1][3].
4. **Operational and Financial Pressures**: The company faces operational challenges, including higher commodity and labor costs, and significant negative impacts from foreign currency translation[1][2][3].
5. **Franchisee Relations and Confidence**: While franchisees are generally successful, recent performance issues have led to frustration, and the company is working to address these concerns through open dialogue and shared planning[1].

Given these factors:

- The immediate financial performance and guest traffic metrics are weak.
- The company is in the midst of significant restructuring and turnaround efforts.
- There are ongoing external pressures such as currency impacts and macroeconomic challenges.

However, management's proactive steps, including menu simplification, digital engagement initiatives, and a focus on customer-centric strategies, suggest a commitment to improvement.

### Short-Term Impact on Stock Price

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the weak Q1 performance, ongoing restructuring, and external challenges. However, the announcement of a turnaround plan and the proactive measures being taken could mitigate some of the negative sentiment.

**Rating: -1**

This rating reflects the short-term negative impact from current performance and challenges, but also acknowledges the potential for future improvement based on the turnaround plans and management's proactive steps.
