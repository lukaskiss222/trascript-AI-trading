McDonald's Q1 2019 earnings call indicates a strong start to the year, driven by several positive factors. Here are the key points that suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock:

1. **Strong Global Comparable Sales**: McDonald's reported a 5.4% increase in global comparable sales, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of positive growth. This broad-based momentum is a significant indicator of the company's execution on its Velocity Growth Plan[2][3].

2. **U.S. Performance**: The U.S. segment saw a 4.5% increase in comparable sales, driven by successful promotions like the Bacon Event and the 2 for $5 Mix and Match deal. Despite negative guest counts, average check growth was strong, helped by product mix shifts and pricing[2][3].

3. **EOTF Benefits**: The Experience of the Future (EOTF) modernization efforts are now showing a net positive contribution to sales, with reduced downtime on projects and successful reopenings. This momentum is expected to continue throughout the year[2][3].

4. **Delivery Growth**: McDelivery continues to be a key accelerator, with the business growing to $3 billion globally. The company is confident in unlocking more delivery potential, especially in the U.S., and is working on integrating delivery into its global mobile app[2][3].

5. **Operational Improvements**: Focus on improving drive-thru service times and overall restaurant operations has shown encouraging results, with reduced service times and increased customer satisfaction scores[2][3].

6. **Financial Performance**: Adjusted EPS of $1.78 topped estimates, and the company saw an increase in revenue and operating margin despite some challenges like labor and commodity costs[2][3].

Given these positive indicators, the stock is likely to see a short-term boost due to the strong performance and the company's ongoing initiatives to drive growth and improve operational efficiency.

**Rating: 2**
