The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

## Global Comparable Sales and Market Share
Despite a challenging economic environment, McDonald's reported a 1.9% increase in global comparable sales, with positive sales growth in all major regions. However, the company acknowledged that the economic uncertainties and competitive pressures are expected to continue, affecting both top and bottom lines[4%.

## Tactical Adjustments and Value Focus
McDonald's is making tactical adjustments to emphasize value, which, while initially impacting margins negatively, is expected to drive traffic and eventually balance out with sales gains. The emphasis on value platforms, such as the Dollar Menu in the U.S. and similar initiatives in Europe and Asia-Pacific, is aimed at maintaining and growing market share[4%.

## Margin Pressures
The company faced margin pressures due to higher labor and commodity costs, as well as increased investments in value promotions and technology. These pressures are expected to continue in the near term, particularly in the U.S. and Europe[4%.

## Guidance and Outlook
The guidance for the fourth quarter and 2013 indicates continued challenges, including higher commodity costs and economic uncertainties. However, the company remains confident in its long-term strategy and the ability to navigate these challenges[4%.

Given these points:

- The short-term outlook is cautious due to ongoing economic challenges, higher costs, and margin pressures.
- However, the company's strategic focus on value, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility suggests long-term potential.
- The immediate impact on the stock might be negative due to the near-term pressures and cautious guidance.
