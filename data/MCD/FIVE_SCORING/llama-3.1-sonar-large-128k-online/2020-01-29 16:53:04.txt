The transcript for McDonald's Corporation's Q4 2019 earnings call presents several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Performance**: McDonald's reported a historic milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales, with a 5.9% increase in global comparable sales, the highest in over a decade. This strong top-line growth and the achievement of record franchisee cash flows are positive indicators[1][5].
- **Successful Execution of Velocity Growth Plan**: The company's Velocity Growth Plan has driven significant growth, particularly in areas like Experience of the Future (EOTF), digital engagement, and delivery. These initiatives have contributed to increased customer satisfaction and sales[1][5].
- **Robust International Performance**: International Operated Markets and International Developed Licensee segments showed strong comp sales growth, with notable performance in France, the UK, and other key markets[1].

### Neutral to Positive Factors
- **Investments in Technology**: McDonald's has made significant investments in technology, including acquisitions like Dynamic Yield and Apprente, which are expected to drive long-term growth. While these investments may increase G&A in the short term, they are seen as strategic moves to enhance customer experience and drive sales[1][5].
- **CapEx Strategy**: The company's capital expenditure strategy is focused on high-return investments, particularly in international markets, which suggests continued growth opportunities[1].

### Potential Challenges
- **Competitive Environment**: The industry is highly competitive, especially in the breakfast daypart, with McDonald's facing intensified competition. However, the company is confident in its ability to maintain market share through menu innovations, value offerings, and operational improvements[1].
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Although the impact of COVID-19 on China is mentioned, it is noted that China represents only about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and 3% of operating income, so the overall impact on McDonald's global performance is expected to be limited[1].

### Conclusion
Given the strong financial performance, successful execution of the Velocity Growth Plan, and strategic investments in technology and international expansion, McDonald's is likely to see a positive impact on its stock price in the short term. The competitive environment and COVID-19 impact are manageable and do not appear to overshadow the overall positive momentum.
