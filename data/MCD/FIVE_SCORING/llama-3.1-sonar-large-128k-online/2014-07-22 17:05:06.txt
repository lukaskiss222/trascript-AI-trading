The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation from July 2014 indicates several challenges and strategic initiatives that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance.

### Key Points:
- **Global Comparable Sales**: Relatively flat, with a 1.5% decline in the U.S. and negative guest traffic across all major segments[1][4].
- **Operating Income and Margins**: Down 1% in constant currencies, with declines in Europe and the U.S. due to higher labor and commodity costs[1][4].
- **Strategic Initiatives**: Focus on strengthening foundational elements such as value, operations, marketing, and simplification. Long-term growth strategies include menu customization, digital engagement, and enhancing brand relevance[4].
- **Regional Performance**: Stronger performance in China, UK, and France, but weaknesses in Germany, Japan, U.S., and Australia[4].
- **Cost Pressures**: Higher labor costs, commodity costs, and currency volatility expected to continue impacting margins in the second half of the year[4].

### Short-Term Implications:
Given the mixed performance and ongoing challenges, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure. The lack of significant immediate turnaround in sales and the continued negative guest traffic trends are concerns. However, the company's commitment to its strategic growth initiatives and its strong financial foundation provide some stability.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the tempered guidance, ongoing cost pressures, and the time required to see the effects of the company's strategic initiatives.
