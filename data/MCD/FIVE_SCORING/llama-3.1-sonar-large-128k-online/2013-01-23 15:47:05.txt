Based on the McDonald's January 23, 2013 Investor Conference Call transcript, here are the key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

- **Global Comparable Sales**: Decreased by 1.0% in the first quarter, with declines in the U.S. (-1.2%), Europe (-1.1%), and APMEA (-3.3%)[1].
- **Revenue and Operating Income**: Consolidated revenues increased by 1%, but operating income decreased by 1% due to challenging prior year comparisons and global economic headwinds[1].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company expects slightly negative global comparable sales for April, indicating ongoing challenges. However, management remains confident in their long-term plans and the company's ability to navigate these challenges[1].
- **Value and Menu Strategies**: The focus on value, particularly the Dollar Menu, has shown mixed results. While it has helped in the U.S., Japan is experiencing some difficulties due to changes in promotional strategies[1][Transcript].
- **Leadership Changes**: The recent leadership change in the U.S. is expected to bring fresh perspectives and operational expertise, but its immediate impact on short-term performance is uncertain[Transcript].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the negative comparable sales, decreased operating income, and ongoing global economic challenges. However, the company's long-term strategies and recent leadership changes suggest potential for future improvement.
