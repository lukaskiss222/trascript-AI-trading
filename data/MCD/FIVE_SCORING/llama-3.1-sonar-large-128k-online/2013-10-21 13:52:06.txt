The Q3 2013 earnings call for McDonald's Corporation reveals several key points that indicate a mixed outlook for the short term:

## Key Points:
- **Global Comparable Sales**: While global comparable sales increased by 0.9%, this growth was not as strong as desired, and the company expects October sales to be relatively flat due to ongoing macroeconomic and competitive pressures[5].
- **Regional Performance**: The U.S. saw a 0.7% increase in comparable sales, Europe had a 0.2% increase, but APMEA experienced a 1.4% decline. These regional performances indicate varying levels of challenge and opportunity[5].
- **Operating Income and Margins**: Despite solid revenue and operating income growth, the company anticipates margin pressures in the fourth quarter, particularly due to higher commodity costs and labor expenses. Europe's margins are expected to decline from the third quarter levels due to one-time benefits not repeating[5].
- **Pricing and Affordability**: McDonald's is cautious with pricing due to consumer price sensitivity and competition. The introduction of the Dollar Menu and More is aimed at maintaining affordability while offering slightly higher-priced options to boost margins[5].
- **Investments and Expansion**: The company is continuing to invest in restaurant modernization, technology, and new openings, although some new openings have been delayed due to current market conditions[5].

## Short-Term Impact:
Given the mixed performance and the anticipation of continued challenges in the fourth quarter, the stock is likely to experience some pressure. The company's ability to maintain solid financial performance despite these challenges is a positive, but the flat sales outlook and margin pressures could weigh on investor sentiment.

## Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the tempered guidance and ongoing challenges in key markets.
