The transcript from McDonald's January 2015 investor conference call indicates several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Challenging 2014 and Near-Term Outlook**: The company faced significant challenges in 2014, including underperformance in the U.S., supplier issues in APMEA, and economic difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine. These challenges are expected to continue into the first half of 2015, which may keep the stock under pressure.

2. **Turnaround Initiatives**: McDonald's is implementing various turnaround strategies, such as menu rationalization, increased focus on customer experience, and the rollout of Create Your Taste. While these initiatives show promise, their full impact may take time to materialize, particularly in larger markets like the U.S..

3. **Financial Performance and Guidance**: The company reported declines in operating income and earnings per share for 2014. For 2015, McDonald's expects continued sales and earnings pressure, especially in the first half, due to factors like commodity cost increases, labor costs, and foreign currency impacts.

4. **Capital Expenditure and Franchising**: The reduction in capital expenditures and a shift towards franchising are strategic moves aimed at optimizing resources and focusing on high-return initiatives. However, these changes might not immediately translate into improved financial performance.

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the continued challenges and the time required for the turnaround initiatives to show significant results.
