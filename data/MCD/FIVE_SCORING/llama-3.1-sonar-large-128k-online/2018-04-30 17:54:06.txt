The transcript for McDonald's Corporation's Q1 2018 earnings call highlights several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Positive Comparable Sales**: McDonald's reported a 5.5% increase in global comparable sales, driven by strong performance in International Lead markets, High Growth markets, and Foundational markets. This broad-based growth indicates healthy business momentum[4].

2. **Value Platform and Menu Innovations**: The $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu has been performing in line with expectations, although it has not yet driven significant guest count growth. The introduction of fresh beef Quarter Pounders and other premium products has been well-received, suggesting potential for continued sales growth[4].

3. **Experience of the Future (EOTF) Initiatives**: The aggressive rollout of EOTF restaurants, including modernizations and technological enhancements, is expected to continue driving sales growth despite some short-term disruptions during the renovation periods[4].

4. **Cost and Margin Management**: Despite cost pressures from labor and commodities, McDonald's has managed to maintain healthy margins through refranchising, lower advertising contributions, and operational efficiencies. The operating margin is expected to remain strong, with a long-term goal of reaching mid-40s[4].

5. **Macro and Competitive Environment**: The company is performing well in a relatively calm but competitive European market, gaining market share without significant macro tailwinds. This suggests that McDonald's success is largely due to its own initiatives rather than external factors[4].

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive, indicating sustained business momentum, successful execution of strategic initiatives, and strong financial performance. However, there are some short-term challenges such as weather impacts and guest count declines in the U.S. that might temper immediate stock performance.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong comparable sales growth, successful execution of strategic initiatives, and robust financial performance.
