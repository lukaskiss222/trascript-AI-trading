The transcript for McDonald's Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2020 investor conference call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance. Here are the key points:

- **Strong U.S. Performance**: The U.S. segment showed significant resilience, with a 5.5% increase in comparable sales for the quarter and six consecutive years of positive comparable sales. The average U.S. franchisee restaurant operating cash flow reached an all-time high in 2020[3].

- **International Challenges**: International Operated Markets (IOM) faced significant challenges due to COVID-19 resurgences and government restrictions, leading to negative comparable sales. However, markets like Australia and the U.K. performed well, and there is optimism about post-pandemic recovery[3].

- **Digital and Delivery Growth**: McDonald's saw substantial growth in digital sales and delivery, which are expected to remain elevated post-pandemic. This shift is anticipated to benefit average check sizes and overall sales[3].

- **Marketing and Menu Strategies**: The company is focusing on its "Accelerating the Arches" strategy, emphasizing marketing, core menu items, and digital/delivery growth. New product launches, such as the crispy chicken sandwich, and loyalty programs are expected to drive sales and market share gains[3].

- **Financial Outlook**: Despite the challenges, McDonald's expects low double-digit systemwide sales growth in 2021, with operating margins in the low to mid 40s. The company also plans significant capital expenditures for new restaurant openings and modernization[3].

Given these points, here is the likely short-term impact on the stock:

- The strong performance in the U.S., ongoing growth in digital and delivery channels, and the company's strategic initiatives to drive sales and market share are positive indicators.
- However, the ongoing challenges in international markets and the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic could temper immediate stock gains.

### Conclusion
The overall sentiment from the call is positive, particularly driven by the U.S. performance and strategic growth initiatives, but it is balanced by the ongoing challenges in international markets.
