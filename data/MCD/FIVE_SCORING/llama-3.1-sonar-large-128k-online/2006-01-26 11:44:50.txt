The earnings call for McDonald's Corporation in 2006 presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: McDonald's reported solid financial results for 2005, including a 4.2% increase in comparable sales, a 4.5% increase in revenues, and a record high annual revenue of over $20 billion. This strong performance is likely to positively impact investor confidence[1].

2. **Shareholder Value Enhancement**: The company announced significant returns to shareholders, including a 22% increase in the annual dividend and $1.2 billion in share repurchases for 2005, with plans to return another $5 billion to $6 billion through dividends and share repurchases in 2006 and 2007. This commitment to returning value to shareholders is a positive signal[1].

3. **Strategic Initiatives**: McDonald's outlined several strategic initiatives, including the expansion of drive-throughs, especially in high-growth markets like China, and the introduction of new menu items. These initiatives aim to drive growth and improve customer experience, which can be seen as positive for long-term growth[1].

4. **Ownership Structure Adjustments**: The company discussed plans to refranchise some company-operated restaurants, particularly in the UK, and to convert certain markets to developmental licenses. While these changes are intended to improve efficiency and performance, they might introduce some short-term uncertainty[1].

5. **Cost Management and Challenges**: Higher beef costs, utility costs, and labor costs were noted as challenges, especially in Europe. However, the company has plans in place to address these issues, which suggests proactive management[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong financial performance, significant shareholder value returns, and strategic initiatives for growth. However, there are some minor uncertainties related to cost management and ownership structure adjustments.
