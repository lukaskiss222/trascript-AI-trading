The transcript of McDonald's Corporation's Second Quarter 2018 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company. Here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Positive Factors
- **Global Comparable Sales Growth**: McDonald's reported a 4% increase in global comparable sales, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth. This is a strong indicator of the effectiveness of their Velocity Growth Plan[5].
- **International Performance**: International Lead markets, such as the UK, Canada, and France, continued to perform well with high single-digit sales increases and robust guest count growth. This reinforces the success of their strategies in these markets[5].
- **Delivery Growth**: Delivery is becoming a significant contributor to sales, with over 13,000 restaurants offering delivery across 60 markets. This initiative is seeing strong customer response and is expected to continue growing[5].
- **EOTF Conversions**: The aggressive pace of Experience of the Future (EOTF) restaurant conversions, with over 1,300 conversions in the quarter, is expected to drive long-term sales growth despite some short-term operational disruptions[5].

## Challenges and Negative Factors
- **U.S. Guest Count**: Despite positive comparable sales in the U.S., guest counts decreased, indicating a need to improve traffic. The competitive environment, particularly in value offerings, has been challenging[5].
- **Labor and Commodity Pressures**: The company faces ongoing labor and commodity cost pressures, which have impacted company-operated margins. However, franchise margins have remained strong[5].
- **EOTF Downtime**: The conversion process for EOTF has resulted in some downtime for restaurants, affecting short-term sales and guest counts. However, this is seen as a necessary step for long-term growth[5].
- **Breakfast Performance**: McDonald's has seen a decline in breakfast guest counts, although breakfast comp sales were positive in the second quarter. The company is adjusting its marketing strategy to better support breakfast sales[5].

## Conclusion
Given the balanced mix of positive and negative factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact. The company's strong global performance, successful delivery initiatives, and ongoing EOTF conversions are significant positives. However, the challenges in the U.S. market, including guest count declines and operational disruptions, may temper some of the enthusiasm.
