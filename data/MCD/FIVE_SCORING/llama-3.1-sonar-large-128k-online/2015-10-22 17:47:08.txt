The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation indicates several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Factors
- The company reported positive comparable sales growth across all segments, with notable improvements in the U.S., Australia, the UK, and Canada. The U.S. segment saw its first quarterly comparable sales increase in two years, driven by new menu items and operational improvements[4].
- The successful rollout of all-day breakfast in the U.S. has been well-received by customers and operators, indicating potential for sustained growth[4].
- Enhancements in food quality, operational efficiency, and customer experience have led to improved customer feedback scores[4].
- The new segment structure is expected to bring greater visibility into key markets and leverage collective insights to improve customer experience[4].

## Challenging Factors
- Labor costs in the U.S. are expected to continue impacting margins, with the additional labor investments and state-mandated wage increases expected to remain a pressure point for the next few quarters[4].
- Currency translation is anticipated to be a headwind for the fourth quarter of 2015, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10[4].
- Economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia could pose near-term headwinds despite current positive comparable sales in these markets[4].

## Conclusion
Given the overall positive tone of the earnings call, including the successful turnaround initiatives, improved customer feedback, and positive comparable sales growth, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the ongoing labor cost pressures and currency headwinds might temper the magnitude of this positivity.
