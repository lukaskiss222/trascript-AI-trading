McDonald's third quarter 2018 results and the subsequent investor call highlighted several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Positive Global Comparable Sales**: McDonald's achieved its 13th consecutive quarter of global comparable sales growth, with a 4.2% increase, driven by strong performances in international markets such as Canada, Australia, and France. This positive trend is a strong indicator of the company's execution of its growth strategy[2][3].

2. **U.S. Market Challenges**: Despite the global success, the U.S. market faced challenges, including declining guest counts and margin pressures due to the ongoing Experience of the Future (EOTF) modernization initiative, labor costs, and commodity pressures. However, the company is seeing encouraging responses from customers in modernized restaurants and is focused on optimizing the EOTF rollout[2][3].

3. **Financial Performance**: The company reported a 22% increase in earnings per share in constant currencies, excluding prior year special items. The effective tax rate was lower, contributing to the earnings boost, and the company increased its quarterly dividend by 15%[2][3].

4. **Strategic Initiatives**: McDonald's is making significant progress with its Velocity Growth Plan, which includes delivery, digital enhancements, and EOTF initiatives. These have shown positive impacts on sales and customer satisfaction, particularly in international markets[2][3].

5. **Capital Allocation and Guidance**: The company remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, with a focus on investing in the business to drive future growth. The capital expenditure for 2018 was around $2.5 billion, and similar or slightly higher spending is expected for 2019[2][3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call was positive, highlighting the company's ability to drive growth through its strategic initiatives despite some short-term challenges in the U.S. market. The strong global comparable sales, increasing earnings per share, and confident outlook for 2019 are likely to have a positive impact on the stock.
