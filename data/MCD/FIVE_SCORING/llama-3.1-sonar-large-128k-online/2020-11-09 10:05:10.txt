McDonald's third-quarter 2020 earnings call presented a mixed but overall positive outlook. Here are the key points:

- **Positive U.S. Performance**: The U.S. segment saw a 4.6% increase in comparable sales, driven by strong average check growth and successful marketing initiatives, such as the Famous Orders platform and the introduction of new menu items[4].
- **Global Recovery**: Despite global comparable sales declining by 2.2%, there was sequential improvement across all segments, with drive-thru and delivery sales remaining strong[4].
- **International Variability**: International Operated Markets and International Developmental Licensed Markets faced challenges, particularly in Europe and Latin America, but saw improvements in certain regions like Australia and Japan[4].
- **Financial Performance**: Adjusted earnings per share grew 4% in constant currencies, and the company maintained a strong financial position, reflected in a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend[4].
- **Operational Strengths**: McDonald's leveraged its drive-thru, delivery, and digital capabilities effectively, which were crucial during the pandemic. The company also highlighted its commitment to safety and operational adjustments to navigate the ongoing health crisis[4].

Given these factors:

- The strong U.S. performance and overall resilience of the business during the pandemic are likely to positively impact investor sentiment.
- The sequential improvements in global comparable sales and the company's ability to adapt to the new operating environment suggest continued recovery.
- The increase in the dividend and strong financial management further reinforce confidence in the company's long-term strategy.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on McDonald's stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong earnings, successful marketing initiatives, and the company's ability to navigate the pandemic effectively.
