The transcript for McDonald's Corporation's Q3 2019 earnings call highlights several key points that are relevant for assessing the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Global Comparable Sales**: McDonald's reported a 5.9% increase in global comparable sales, marking the 17th consecutive quarter of growth. This broad-based momentum is a positive indicator[1][3].

2. **Operational Improvements**: The company has seen significant operational improvements, including reduced drive-thru service times, improved customer satisfaction scores, and efficient restaurant operations. These factors contribute to a positive outlook[1][3].

3. **Technology Investments**: McDonald's is investing heavily in technology, such as Dynamic Yield and Apprente, which are showing promising results in terms of customer experience and operational efficiency. This suggests long-term growth potential but may come with short-term costs[1][3].

4. **Competitive Environment**: The breakfast day part is becoming increasingly competitive, but McDonald's is taking steps to protect and grow its share. The introduction of plant-based burgers and other menu items also shows the company's adaptability to consumer trends[1][3].

5. **Financial Performance**: Despite some short-term financial headwinds, such as higher G&A expenses and depreciation from EOTF deployments, the company's overall financial performance remains strong. The operating margin and franchise margin dollars have grown, indicating stability and growth in the business model[1][3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong operational performance, continued growth in key metrics, and strategic investments for long-term success. However, there are some short-term financial and competitive challenges that might temper immediate investor enthusiasm.

### Prediction:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's strong operational performance, continued global comparable sales growth, and strategic technology investments. However, the immediate financial headwinds and competitive pressures might prevent a more significant rally.
