Based on the transcript of McDonald's Corporation's Q4 2018 earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term stock price outlook:

- **Strong Performance and Momentum**: McDonald's reported strong global comparable sales growth of 4.4% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year, along with 14 consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales. This indicates broad-based momentum across most of their top markets[1][2].
  
- **Financial Performance**: The company saw a significant increase in earnings per share, driven by a lower effective tax rate and strong operating performance. However, there were some headwinds, including higher depreciation costs related to the Experience of the Future (EOTF) modernization and foreign currency translation pressures[1][2].

- **Guidance and Outlook**: For 2019, McDonald's expects some financial headwinds, including labor costs, EOTF-related depreciation, commodity increases, and foreign currency translation pressures. Despite these challenges, the company is confident in its long-term strategy and targets, including systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5% and high single-digit EPS growth[1][2].

- **Operational Improvements**: McDonald's is focusing on operational improvements, particularly in the U.S., such as enhancing drive-thru service times and simplifying menus. These efforts are expected to improve customer satisfaction and drive traffic growth[1].

- **Delivery Growth**: The company experienced strong growth in delivery, with it now available in over 19,000 restaurants. Delivery sales growth is high, and the company is working to increase awareness and drive further adoption[1].

Given these points, here is the reasoning for the short-term stock impact:

- The strong performance in 2018 and the continued momentum across key markets are positive indicators.
- However, the anticipated financial headwinds in 2019, such as increased depreciation and commodity costs, could pressure EPS growth.
- The company's commitment to operational improvements and its success in delivery suggest long-term growth potential.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term due to the balance between strong current performance and anticipated headwinds in the upcoming year.
