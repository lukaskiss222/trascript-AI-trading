The Q1 2020 earnings call for McDonald's Corporation reveals several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic has significantly impacted McDonald's global operations, leading to a 3.4% decline in global comparable sales and a more severe decline in international markets due to restaurant closures and reduced operations.

2. **Financial Support and Liquidity**: McDonald's has taken proactive steps to support franchisees with rent and royalty deferrals, amounting to approximately $1 billion in liquidity assistance. This move, along with other financial measures, helps maintain franchisee financial health but also indicates short-term financial strain.

3. **Operational Adjustments**: The company has adapted operations to ensure safety, including enhanced cleaning protocols, contactless delivery, and limited menus. These adjustments have helped maintain customer trust and safety but also reflect the challenging operational environment.

4. **Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures**: McDonald's has reduced its capital expenditures by about $1 billion and suspended non-essential spending to manage cash flow. Despite a strong balance sheet, the company anticipates negative free cash flow in the second quarter but expects it to turn positive by the third quarter.

5. **Recovery Expectations**: The recovery is expected to be slow and varied by market. The U.S. has shown some improvement, but international markets, especially those with fewer drive-thru operations, are facing a more challenging recovery path.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for McDonald's stock is likely to be influenced by the ongoing pandemic's impact on global operations, financial strain, and the uncertainty surrounding the pace of recovery.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on operations, the need for substantial financial support for franchisees, and the uncertainty around the recovery timeline. However, McDonald's strong balance sheet and proactive measures to manage the crisis suggest resilience.
