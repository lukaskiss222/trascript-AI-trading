The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation indicates several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Performance in 2017**: McDonald's reported a strong year with 5.5% global comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter and 5.3% for the full year, the best performance in six years. This momentum is expected to continue into 2018 with ongoing investments in the "Experience of the Future" (EOTF) initiative and other growth platforms like delivery and mobile order and pay.
- **Tax Reform Benefits**: The company expects a lower effective tax rate of 25-27% in 2018 due to U.S. tax reform, leading to an incremental cash flow benefit of $400-500 million annually. This could enhance shareholder returns and investments in the business.
- **Franchisee Confidence**: Despite significant investments required for EOTF, franchisees are confident and committed to the plan, which is a positive signal for long-term growth.

### Challenging Aspects:
- **One-Time Tax Costs**: The fourth quarter of 2017 included a significant one-time net tax cost related to U.S. tax reform, which affected EPS. However, excluding this impact, diluted EPS increased 19%.
- **Labor Pressures**: The company is facing higher labor costs and wage pressures, particularly in the U.S., which could pressure margins despite positive sales growth.
- **Complexity of Multiple Initiatives**: Franchisees are managing multiple simultaneous initiatives, which could lead to operational challenges and some anxiety, though the overall sentiment remains positive.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong performance, ongoing momentum, and benefits from tax reform, the stock is likely to see positive short-term implications. However, the immediate impact of labor pressures and the complexity of executing multiple initiatives might temper some of the enthusiasm.
