The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation from October 24, 2017, indicates several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Global Performance**: McDonald's reported a 6% increase in global comparable sales and a 9% increase in EPS (excluding special items), which are positive indicators of the company's momentum[5.).

2. **U.S. Market Recovery**: The U.S. segment showed a 4.1% increase in comparable sales, driven by compelling value programs and menu innovations, which is a significant improvement and a positive sign for the U.S. market[5].

3. **Digital and Delivery Initiatives**: The company is making significant progress with its digital, delivery, and Experience of the Future (EOTF) initiatives. These are seen as long-term growth drivers, and early results are encouraging, although they may have short-term impacts on margins due to training and implementation costs[5].

4. **Refranchising and Financial Impact**: The refranchising of China and Hong Kong markets, while beneficial for long-term growth and free cash flow, will have a short-term negative impact on EPS and operating income. However, the company plans to use the proceeds to repurchase shares, which should mitigate some of the EPS impact[5].

5. **Value Strategy and Margins**: The upcoming national value platform in the U.S. and ongoing labor investments may put temporary pressure on margins, but the company believes these investments will be offset by efficiencies and long-term growth[5].

Given these points:

- The strong global and U.S. performance, along with the promising early results from digital and delivery initiatives, are likely to be viewed positively by investors.
- The temporary margin pressure and refranchising impacts, while notable, are part of a broader strategic plan aimed at long-term growth.

### Conclusion:
The overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with significant momentum in key areas and a clear strategy for long-term growth. However, there are some short-term challenges related to refranchising and labor investments.

### Rating:
1

This rating reflects the positive short-term impact from strong performance and growth initiatives, despite some minor short-term challenges.
