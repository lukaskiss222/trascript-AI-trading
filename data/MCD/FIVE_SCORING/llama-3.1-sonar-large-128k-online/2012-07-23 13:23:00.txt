The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation highlights several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Global Economic Headwinds**: McDonald's is facing significant macroeconomic challenges, including declining consumer confidence, higher commodity and labor costs, and a heightened competitive landscape. These factors are expected to continue impacting the business in the short term[5].

2. **Slowing Sales Growth**: While McDonald's achieved solid performance in the second quarter, with global comparable sales up 3.7%, the momentum is expected to slow in July and potentially beyond. This slowdown, coupled with increased costs, may pressure margins and earnings[5].

3. **Value Focus and Margin Impact**: The company is emphasizing value platforms to drive traffic, which could temporarily impact margins. However, this strategy is seen as necessary to maintain market share and drive long-term growth[5].

4. **Investments and CapEx**: McDonald's is making significant investments in technology, restaurant reimages, and new store openings. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they may affect short-term profitability[5].

5. **Guidance and Expectations**: The company indicated that it may not meet its long-term average annual constant currency operating income growth target of 6% to 7% for 2012 due to current economic challenges. This could temper investor expectations[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the slowing sales growth, increased cost pressures, and the general economic uncertainty. However, the company's resilient business model, ongoing investments in growth initiatives, and its ability to adapt to challenging environments suggest that the long-term outlook remains positive.
