McDonald's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Strong Sales and Profitability**: Global comparable sales were up 4.3%, operating income increased 5% in constant currency, and EPS rose 17% in constant currency. These metrics indicate robust performance despite a challenging economic environment[4].

2. **Continued Market Share Growth**: McDonald's reported growing market share in every major country, including the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. This is a strong indicator of the company's competitive strength and customer relevance[4].

3. **Financial Discipline and Cash Return**: The company is on track to meet its three-year target of returning $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders by the end of 2009. This demonstrates a commitment to shareholder value and financial health[4].

4. **Positive Outlook on Costs and Currency**: While commodity costs and currency fluctuations posed some challenges, management expressed confidence in managing these factors and expected costs to moderate throughout the year[4].

5. **Successful Strategies and Initiatives**: The rollout of McCafe, focus on core menu items, and investments in restaurant improvements and convenience initiatives (like 24-hour drive-throughs) are all contributing to the company's success[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial performance, market share gains, and effective management strategies.
