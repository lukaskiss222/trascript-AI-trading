The transcript of McDonald's October 2014 investor conference call highlights several challenges and strategies that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Disappointing Performance**: McDonald's reported a significant decline in third-quarter earnings, with global comparable sales down 3.3%, operating income down 14%, and EPS down 28% in constant currencies. These results were impacted by various internal and external factors, including a higher tax rate, the supplier issue in China, and economic instability in Russia and Ukraine.

2. **Ongoing Challenges**: The company expects continued sales and earnings pressure in the fourth quarter, with comparable sales anticipated to be negative in October. This indicates that the immediate future may not see a quick turnaround.

3. **Strategic Initiatives**: Despite the challenges, McDonald's is implementing several strategic initiatives to improve performance, such as menu simplification, local market autonomy, digital enhancements, and the "Experience of the Future" program. However, these changes are in the early stages and may take time to yield significant results.

4. **Financial Discipline**: The company is reducing capital expenditures and scrutinizing G&A spending to redirect resources towards growth initiatives, which could be seen as positive steps but may not immediately boost short-term performance.

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for McDonald's stock is likely negative due to the ongoing performance issues, despite the promising long-term strategies.
