The earnings transcript for McDonald's Corporation from the July 23, 2015, investor conference call indicates several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

## Positive Indicators:
- McDonald's is seeing early signs of momentum, particularly in international lead markets such as Australia, Canada, the UK, and Germany, which are driving positive comparable sales growth.
- The company is implementing various initiatives to improve operations, such as simplifying menu boards, enhancing customer service, and introducing new technologies like self-order kiosks and mobile apps.
- The reorganization and restructuring efforts are aimed at eliminating redundancies, maximizing talent, and creating a more agile organization, which could lead to cost savings and improved efficiency.

## Negative Indicators:
- The U.S. market remains a significant challenge, with continued sales decline and negative guest traffic, which is a major drag on overall performance.
- Labor costs are increasing due to minimum wage hikes and other regulatory changes, which could pressure margins.
- The second quarter financial results were disappointing, with operating income down 6% in constant currency, primarily due to weakness in the U.S. and Japan.

## Neutral but Important Points:
- The company is committed to returning significant cash to shareholders, with $2.5 billion returned through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter, and a target of $8 billion to $9 billion for the full year.
- The management is evaluating various financial strategies, including refranchising, G&A savings, and potential adjustments to the dividend policy, which will be updated in November.

Given these points, the short-term impact on McDonald's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the mixed signals. The positive momentum in international markets and the proactive steps to improve operations and financial management could offset some of the disappointment from the U.S. market and labor cost pressures.
