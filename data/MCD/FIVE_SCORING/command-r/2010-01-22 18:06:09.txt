The McDonalds earnings call reveals continued global strength despite the economic downturn. Critical to this success is the company's focus on value, variety and convenience, helping it gain market share. The forthcoming McCafe phase two expansion and breakfast dollar menu are positive initiatives. While US margins benefit from lower commodity costs, reinvestments and refranchising efforts will sustain the business. The permanent dollar menu, strategic cap ex investments and robust cash flow also indicate positive growth. The stock should see a moderate positive bump in the short term.
