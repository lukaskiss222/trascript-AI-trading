Overall the call想像 etc. a sense of urgency regarding McDonald's turnaround efforts. The emphasis on improving customer relationships and market relevance is promising, but the challenges seem deep-seated, involving strategic adjustments and operational enhancements. The stock will likely face continued pressure in the short term as investors assess the efficacy of the company's strategies.
