Despite strong Q2 results, McDonald's stock is unlikely to see a significant boost in the short term. Stupendous sales growth in APMEA, Europe, and the US is commendable, but elevated costs for commodities like coffee and beef burgers coupled with gases could dampen profit margins. The companyâ€™s strategic focus on value meals, menu innovation, and modernization efforts worldwide is encouraging. However, the stock's recent rise might already reflect these positives. Economies worldwide remain precarious, which could affect customer spending, yet McDonald's seems poised to navigate these challenges adeptly. Overall, the outlook is neutral, with moderate upside potential.
