McDonald's Q3 2012 earnings call showed continued pressure on same-store sales, primarily due to macroeconomic factors like declining consumer confidence and higher costs.

The negative October comparable sales trend and lingering macro headwinds point to a possible short-term negative impact in the next few weeks.
