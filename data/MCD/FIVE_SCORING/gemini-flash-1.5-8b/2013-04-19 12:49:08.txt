McDonald's earnings call highlights continued pressure from a challenging macroeconomic environment, impacting comparable sales.  While management expresses confidence in their strategies and long-term growth, the call emphasizes ongoing headwinds like softening consumer confidence and persistent economic issues in several key markets (particularly the UK and Russia).  The company is adjusting their strategies to emphasize value and new menu items, but the short-term outlook remains cautious.
