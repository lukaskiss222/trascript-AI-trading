Management stressed a multi-faceted approach, including menu innovation (Create Your Taste rollout), operational improvements, and reinvigorated marketing; these are aimed at regaining lost ground and market share.  While the call acknowledged ongoing headwinds and projected some volatility, particularly in the first half of 2015, management expressed confidence in the long-term potential of evolving the McDonald's experience.
