McDonald's Q3 2019 earnings show continued global comp sales growth (5.9%) and strong operational improvements, particularly in the US drive-thru.  Management's tone is optimistic about the future, citing continued investments in technology and a focus on improving the customer experience through various initiatives (EOTF, dynamic yield, McDelivery).  However,  the company notes ongoing challenges with US traffic, implying potential short-term competitive pressures that might limit the stockâ€™s immediate, significant rally.
