McDonald's Q3 2015 earnings show positive comparable sales growth in most markets, driven by initiatives like the all-day breakfast rollout and value menu changes.  Management expresses confidence in the turnaround strategy, noting improved customer feedback and operational efficiencies.  However, increased labor costs in the U.S. are a near-term headwind.  The stock is likely to see positive movement due to the strong performance and optimistic outlook, but potential headwinds and uncertainty around future results could moderate the short-term rally.
