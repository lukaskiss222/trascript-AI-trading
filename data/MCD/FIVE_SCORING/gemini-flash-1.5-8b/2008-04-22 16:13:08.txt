McDonald's reported strong Q1 2008 results, with comparable sales increases across all regions.  Management highlighted successful strategies in Europe (local relevance, reimaging, and extended hours) and Asia-Pacific (value, convenience, breakfast).  Guidance suggests a cautious outlook for the U.S., affected by Easter shifts and the prevailing economic climate, but with potential for improved comparable sales in April.  These results suggest a positive but potentially moderate impact, as macroeconomic factors impact investor sentiment and the stock might feel some pullback as investors consider the slightly lower than expected U.S results.
