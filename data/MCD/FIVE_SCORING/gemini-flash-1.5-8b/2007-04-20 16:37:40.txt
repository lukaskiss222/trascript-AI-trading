McDonald's reported strong Q1 2007 earnings, exceeding expectations with a 27% increase in EPS year-over-year.  The company highlighted strong performance in Europe and Asia, fueled by menu innovations and a focus on local relevance.  Management's tone is optimistic, with guidance focused on continued growth and a strategic shift towards a more franchise-based model, particularly in Latin America.  This should lead to positive investor sentiment in the next 1-2 weeks.
