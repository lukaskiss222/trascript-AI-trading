McDonald's Q2 2017 earnings report showcases strong global growth, driven by increased guest counts and comparable sales across key markets.  Management's emphasis on value initiatives,  food quality improvements, and the "Experience of the Future" (EOTF) program suggests a positive outlook for the next 1-2 weeks as the company continues implementing its Velocity Growth Plan.  The recent initiatives (delivery, mobile order) are expected to further boost growth, especially among new customer segments.
