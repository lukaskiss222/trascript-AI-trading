McDonald's earnings call highlights a focus on strengthening foundational elements of the business (operations, value, marketing, simplification) while pursuing long-term growth strategies (menu customization, digital engagement, brand trust).  Management acknowledges slower-than-expected comparable sales but projects relatively flat performance for the rest of the year.  The emphasis is on sustained, profitable long-term growth rather than quick fixes, implying a stock impact that is more neutral to slightly negative in the short term.
