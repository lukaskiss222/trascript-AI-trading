McDonald's earnings call highlights strong Q2 performance, exceeding expectations with global comparable sales growth and increased operating income.  Management emphasizes continued execution of the "Plan to Win" strategy, focusing on value, menu choice, and restaurant improvements.  The call also addresses concerns about slowing comps in June, but indicates positive trends in July, especially in the U.S. and Europe.  This suggests continued positive momentum in the near term, likely leading to a stock price rally.
