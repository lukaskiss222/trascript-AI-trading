McDonald's earnings call highlights continued strong global performance, particularly in the U.S. and international operated markets.  Management expressed confidence in maintaining growth momentum, driven by successful menu launches, digital initiatives (delivery, loyalty program), and a resilient franchisee network. While labor shortages and inflation pose challenges, the company anticipates sustained double-digit same-store sales growth.  Strong free cash flow and a dividend increase reinforce the positive outlook.
