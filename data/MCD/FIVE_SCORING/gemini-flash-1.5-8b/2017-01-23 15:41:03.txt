McDonald's reported strong financial performance in 2016, but the earnings call highlighted a continued focus on U.S. traffic growth challenges. While management expressed optimism about initiatives like "Experience of the Future" and value-based promotions, the call lacked specific guidance for 2017, with an update slated for the March investor meeting.  This suggests some lingering concerns and potentially less positive near-term stock impact due to the uncertainty.
