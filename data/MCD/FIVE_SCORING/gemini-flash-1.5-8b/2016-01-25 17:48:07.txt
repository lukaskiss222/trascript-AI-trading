McDonald's earnings call signals positive short-term momentum driven by strong Q4 comparable sales growth, particularly in the U.S.  Management's emphasis on operational improvements, menu innovations (like All-Day Breakfast), and value offerings suggests continued positive trends over the next 1–2 weeks.  The company’s focus on executing the turnaround plan and strategic initiatives like refranchising and digital platforms should lead to continued stock price gains.
