McDonald's reported strong Q1 2009 results, exceeding expectations on several key metrics.  Management highlighted continued sales momentum, especially in the U.S. and key European markets like France, UK, and Russia.  However, the call also acknowledged economic headwinds in China and margin pressures in some European markets due primarily to import costs. These factors suggest a slightly mixed short-term outlook, but with a generally positive trend and a focus on value, the stock is likely to remain stable to positive over the next few weeks.
