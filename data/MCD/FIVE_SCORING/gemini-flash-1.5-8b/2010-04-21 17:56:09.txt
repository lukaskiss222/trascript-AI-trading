McDonald's reported strong first-quarter 2010 earnings, exceeding expectations with 4.2% global comparable sales growth, 13% operating income growth (constant currency), and $1 EPS.  Management emphasized consistent value offerings, menu innovations, and restaurant modernization, particularly highlighting the success of the breakfast dollar menu and the expansion of McCaf√©.  The positive comparable sales and improved operating income, coupled with management's optimistic outlook, suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price over the next couple of weeks.
