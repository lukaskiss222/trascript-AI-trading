McDonald's earnings call reveals a cautious outlook for the remainder of 2013.  While the company reported positive comparable sales growth in the US (outperforming the overall QSR sector) and continued growth in operating income and earnings per share, executives highlighted persistent challenges in the informal eating-out market segment, less pricing power,  and continued cost pressures.  These factors suggest a likely continued flat, or slightly negative, revenue trend for the next few weeks, impacting share price.
