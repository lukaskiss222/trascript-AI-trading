McDonald's Q3 2017 earnings report showcases strong global comparable sales and guest count growth, driven by positive performance across all segments.  Management highlighted successful value initiatives, menu innovations (particularly Signature Crafted sandwiches and McCaf√©), and the expansion of digital offerings like mobile order and pay and delivery.  While refranchising activities create some near-term headwinds, management expressed confidence in the long-term strategy, pointing towards sustained growth and exceeding financial targets in 2019.
