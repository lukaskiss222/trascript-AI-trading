McDonald's Q2 2023 earnings show continued strong performance, driven by consistent execution of the "Accelerating the Arches" strategy and effective marketing, notably the Grimace campaign.  Management projects a moderation in top-line growth in the second half of the year due to normalizing inflation and a challenging macro environment, but maintains optimism about sustained share gains and brand strength.  The company's focus on value offerings and digital engagement should help mitigate potential consumer spending pressures.
