McDonald's Q3 2020 earnings show a mixed picture.  While global comparable sales improved sequentially and the US saw strong performance, with positive comps in all months of the quarter, international markets continue to struggle, particularly in Europe where dine-in sales are heavily reliant.  The company's strategy of focusing on drive-thru and delivery, along with marketing initiatives like the Famous Orders platform, seems to be yielding positive results, suggesting the company is successfully adapting to the pandemic environment.
