McDonald's 2006 earnings call highlights continued positive momentum across all global segments.  Strong revenue growth, margin expansion, and a commitment to shareholder returns (dividend increase and share repurchases) suggest a positive outlook.  Management's focus on operational improvements (new POS system, drive-thru enhancements) and strategic initiatives like developmental licensing, as well as a focus on children's well-being, positions the company for continued success.
