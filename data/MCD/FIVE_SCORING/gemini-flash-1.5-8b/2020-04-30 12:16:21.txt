McDonald's earnings call highlights significant COVID-19 impact on Q1 2020 results, with global comparable sales down 3.4%.  Management emphasizes the resilience of the company, strong franchisee financial positions, and substantial investments in digital capabilities, which are proving crucial during the pandemic.  Guidance for Q2 is expected to be significantly worse than March, but improvements are seen in some areas, particularly in the U.S.  The company's focus on liquidity and franchisee support is a key strategic response.
