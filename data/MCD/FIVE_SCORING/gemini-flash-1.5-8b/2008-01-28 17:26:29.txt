Management emphasizes continued strength in global markets, particularly Europe and Asia-Pacific, and stresses the company's value-driven strategy as a resilience factor.  While acknowledging a possible 1-2% US sales dip, the focus on value, new menu items (including specialty coffee), and continued expansion globally suggests management anticipates mitigating any slowdown.
