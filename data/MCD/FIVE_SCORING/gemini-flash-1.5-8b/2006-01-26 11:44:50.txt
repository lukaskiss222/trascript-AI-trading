McDonald's 2006 earnings call highlighted continued focus on shareholder value through dividend increases and share buybacks, along with a strategic shift towards refranchising company-operated restaurants, particularly in the UK.  Management emphasized a commitment to everyday value, premium items, and convenient locations (especially drive-thrus in China and potentially through other regions), implying a positive outlook on short-term sales growth.  The call also indicated a proactive approach to addressing current and future costs, such as beef and utilities, while reinforcing the companyâ€™s long-term financial health.
