McDonald's Q2 2018 earnings show continued strong comparable sales growth, driven by various initiatives across international and US markets.  While guest counts in the US were down slightly, management highlighted successful execution of the Velocity Growth Plan, particularly with the "Experience of the Future" (EOTF) restaurant conversions and the expanded delivery program.  The company's focus on value and competitive pricing, along with initiatives like its $1-$3 menu, suggests a strategy to maintain market share and potentially increase customer visits in the coming weeks.
