McDonald's earnings call highlighted continued strong performance in 2010, with positive comparable sales growth globally and across segments.  Management emphasized strategic initiatives like menu optimization, restaurant reimaging and value pricing, particularly the success of the Dollar Menu at breakfast.  While acknowledging slower economic recovery, executives anticipate continued growth in 2011 and are confident in their long-term targets.  The call suggests a potential for short-term pressure from price increases to offset rising commodity costs, but overall, the outlook is positive for the stock.
