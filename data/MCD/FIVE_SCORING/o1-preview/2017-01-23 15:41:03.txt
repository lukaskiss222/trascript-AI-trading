McDonaldâ€™s reported strong global comparable sales growth and operating income for 2016, demonstrating the effectiveness of its turnaround plan. Despite a slight decline in U.S. comparable sales due to tough prior-year comparisons, management remains optimistic, highlighting strategic initiatives like refranchising, cost-saving measures, and technology investments to drive future growth. The positive international performance and confident outlook suggest a likely positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
