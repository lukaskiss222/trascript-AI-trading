McDonald's reported strong first-quarter results with global comparable sales up 5.2%, driven by increased guest counts and margin improvements across all geographic segments. Management highlighted successful product launches, effective marketing strategies, and positive momentum in key markets like the U.S., Canada, and Asia-Pacific, while addressing challenges in Europe, particularly the UK.
