McDonald's reported slower sales growth and expects July's global comparable sales to be positive but lower than the second quarter, signaling a deceleration. Management expressed concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, increased competition, higher commodity and labor costs, and adjusted their 2012 growth expectations to be at or below prior targets. This cautious outlook and reduced guidance are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term.
