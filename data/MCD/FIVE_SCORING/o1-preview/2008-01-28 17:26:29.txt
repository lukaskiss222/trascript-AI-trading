McDonald's reported strong global performance with record revenues and robust comparable sales in Europe and APMEA. However, the company acknowledged slowing growth in the U.S., with December comparable sales flat due to severe weather and January expected to increase by only 1.5%. The anticipated impact of the economic environment on U.S. sales and cautious outlook may lead to short-term pressure on the stock price.
