McDonald's Q4 earnings call revealed ongoing challenges, including declining sales, negative comparable store sales, and operational headwinds in key markets such as the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan. Management's cautious tone, acknowledgment of underperformance, and anticipation of continued sales and earnings pressure—especially in the first half of 2015—coupled with reduced capital expenditures and negative guidance, suggest short-term pessimism. These factors are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the next 1–2 weeks.
