McDonald's reported modest global comparable sales growth but faces challenges in key markets like the U.S. and Germany. Management is focusing on menu optimization, enhancing customer experience, and expanding digital initiatives to drive growth. While these strategies may benefit the company in the long term, the short-term impact on the stock is likely neutral due to ongoing market pressures.
