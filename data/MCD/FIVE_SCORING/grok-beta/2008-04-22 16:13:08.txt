McDonaldâ€™s Q1 earnings call highlights a strong performance with global comparable sales up 7.4% and a notable 31% increase in EPS, largely driven by robust sales in Europe (11.1%) and APMEA (9.4%). The focus on menu innovation, especially in key markets like China, Japan, and Australia, as well as continued investment in breakfast and convenience initiatives, supports short-term positive momentum. However, tempered market share gains in the U.S. amid economic challenges might slightly dampen immediate stock enthusiasm, yet the overall global outlook remains strong.
