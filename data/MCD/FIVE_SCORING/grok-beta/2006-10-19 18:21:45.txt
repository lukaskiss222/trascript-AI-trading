McDonald's reported strong sales and earnings growth in Q3 2006, with positive developments in menu innovation, operational efficiency, and brand marketing. However, the transcript highlights several areas of concern for the stock:

1. **Persistent High Commodity Costs**: McDonald's has to navigate rising commodity costs, especially in the US and Europe, which could pressure future margins despite their current strength.

2. **Franchise Margin Concerns**: While company-operated margins improved, franchise margins in Europe did not keep pace, potentially affecting overall profitability and growth potential.

3. **Uncertainty in Divisional License Strategy**: The move towards developmental licensing (DL) for an increased number of restaurants could either dilute control or challenge integration if not executed optimally, with concerns about asset valuation and profitability of the markets being converted.

4. **Marketing and Consumer Perception**: McDonald's is adapting its marketing to focus on trust, relevance, and consumer wellbeing, particularly with initiatives to promote healthier food choices for kids. The success of such initiatives in reversing negative consumer perceptions will be crucial in the short term.

Considering these points, while McDonald's has a solid business backdrop with positive comps and expanding innovations, the short-term stock impact might be influenced more by:
   - The potential impact of upcoming commodity cost increases on profitability.
   - Concerns over the execution and outcomes of the DL strategy, given the scale and timing of these conversions are unclear.
   - Uncertainty around the efficacy of new marketing campaigns in building meaningful consumer trust.

Given these mixed signals, and anticipating potential resistance to the pressurizing factors, I would rate the short-term impact on the stock to be slightly negative.
