McDonald's demonstrated strong performance in 2005, with increased sales, revenue, and EPS, coupled with significant share repurchases and dividend increases. The company's long-term vision for growth, focus on profitable store operations, and deep dive into transparency and accountability around company-operated margins are likely to instill investor confidence. Management is addressing labor and commodity cost increases and seems proactive on operational improvements, which may overshadow short-term issues.
