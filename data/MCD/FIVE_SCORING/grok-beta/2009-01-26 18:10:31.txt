McDonald's significantly outperformed expectations in Q4 2008, reporting strong comparable sales growth and an optimistic tone from management, with particular strengths in Europe and APMEA regions. The expansion into beverage offerings like McCaf√©, continued focus on value across the menu, and plans for substantial share repurchase and capital expenditure programs signal a positive outlook for the short-term. The company's ability to grow traffic amidst a recession, coupled with strong guidance for 2009, implies that the stock is likely to see a positive reaction.
