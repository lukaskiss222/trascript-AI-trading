McDonald's reported solid second-quarter results, with global comparable sales up 3.7% and earnings per share increasing by 3% in constant currencies. However, management highlighted significant cost pressures, a slowing global economy, and strategic investments in value platforms that might put pressure on margins short-term. Furthermore, forward-looking statements suggested that economic headwinds and consumer sentiment could impact performance, potentially resulting in operating income growth falling below targets for 2012. This, coupled with negative foreign currency impacts on EPS, points towards a cautious short-term outlook for the stock price.
