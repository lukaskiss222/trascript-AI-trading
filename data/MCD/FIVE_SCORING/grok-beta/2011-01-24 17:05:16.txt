McDonald's reported a 5% increase in global comparable sales for both the quarter and the full year, showing continued strength and market share growth. Despite concerns like weather impacts and commodity inflation, their four key segments (U.S., Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East/Africa) performed well with initiatives like the Dollar Menu, McCaf√©, and strategic pricing adjustments, suggesting McDonald's ability to maintain momentum and address challenges. These factors indicate an overall positive short-term impact on the stock price.
