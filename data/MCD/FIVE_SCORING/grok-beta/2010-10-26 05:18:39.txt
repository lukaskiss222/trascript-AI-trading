McDonald’s reported a very strong Q3 2010, highlighting robust global sales growth, with a 30th consecutive quarter of increased comparable sales and optimistic ongoing momentum. Management expressed confidence in innovation and customer-centric strategies, projecting sustained growth despite economic uncertainties. Initiatives like the successful introduction of smoothies, frappés, and all-day menu items suggest McDonald's is well-positioned for maintaining and perhaps improving short-term stock performance.
