McDonald's Q1 2012 results indicate several factors that could influence its stock price in the short term. The company achieved strong global sales growth and maintained positive momentum, gaining market share amidst a challenging economic environment. Key points include:

- **Global comparable sales increased by 7.3%**, showcasing robust consumer demand across different regions.
- **Guidance for continued growth**: The management's plan for 2012 focuses on investments to sustain long-term growth, which might impact near-term profit margins but targets a long-term increase in shareholder value. 
- **Competitive pressures**: While McDonald's remains confident in its strategies, the competitive landscape, particularly in the U.S., could put pressure on its stock if competitors' efforts gain traction.
- **Operational improvements**: Investment in reimaging and technology to improve throughput and customer experience could positively impact customer traffic.

Given these factors, while there are immediate concerns about pricing power in Europe, strategic efforts in value positioning, operational efficiency improvements, and a commitment to maintaining competitive advantages suggest a **neutral impact** on stock price in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
