McDonald's demonstrated strong quarterly performance with a 6.5% global comparable sales increase and significant growth in the U.S. and international markets. Management's positive tone around ongoing initiatives like EOTF and McDelivery, along with optimistic guidance, suggests investor confidence. These factors are likely to drive the stock higher in the short term.
