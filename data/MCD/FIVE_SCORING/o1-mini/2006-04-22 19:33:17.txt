McDonald's reported strong Q1 performance with global comparable sales up 5.2% and improved margins across all regions. The introduction of new products and strategic initiatives like reimaging and cashless transactions indicate continued growth potential, despite some cost pressures and challenges in the UK market. Overall, the positive results and optimistic guidance are likely to support a slight increase in the stock price in the short term.
