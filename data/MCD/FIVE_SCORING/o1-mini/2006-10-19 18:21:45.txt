McDonald's delivered strong Q3 results with an 8% increase in system-wide sales and a 17% rise in EPS, driven by successful strategic initiatives and global expansion. Management's positive tone, emphasis on shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, and effective turnaround in key markets like the UK suggest investor confidence. These factors are likely to boost the stock in the short term.
