McDonald's reported a strong performance for 2018, with a 4.4% increase in global comparable sales for the fourth quarter, showing broad-based momentum across its system. The company's initiatives, including restaurant modernization, digital enhancements, and the expansion of delivery services, have contributed to these positive results. However, despite the strong sales momentum, the U.S. faced some challenges, such as negative comp guest counts and margin pressures from modernization efforts, which could impact short-term sentiment. Overall, the emphasis on modernization and strategic investments signals optimism, yet potential cost pressures and the competitive U.S. environment may moderate the stock's short-term upward movement.
