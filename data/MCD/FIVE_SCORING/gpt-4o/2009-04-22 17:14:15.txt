McDonald's reported a strong first quarter with a 4.3% increase in global comparable sales and a notable 17% rise in EPS. Management expressed confidence in continued growth due to strategic cost management, value menu offerings, and expansion initiatives, including McCafe rollout in the US. Despite some challenges in specific markets like Southern China and currency impacts in Eastern Europe, McDonald's continues to gain market share globally.
