McDonald's 2010 performance demonstrated resilience and strong execution of its Plan to Win strategy, driving comparable sales and market share gains despite challenging economic conditions. The company delivered strong global sales growth, particularly with robust gains in its coffee and breakfast offerings, and maintained impressive operational margins. However, concerns about input cost pressures and regional economic uncertainties, particularly in Europe, were noted. Overall, the upbeat management tone and effective cost management suggest positive stock momentum in the near term, despite outlined challenges.
