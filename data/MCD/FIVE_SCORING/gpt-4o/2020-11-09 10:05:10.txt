McDonald's demonstrated resilience throughout Q3 2020, with an impressive recovery in global comparable sales and particularly strong U.S. performance, including the highest monthly comps in nearly a decade. Despite challenges from pandemic-related restrictions, the company's strategic focus on drive-thru and delivery, along with successful marketing initiatives such as the Travis Scott meal, bolstered consumer engagement and sales. The upbeat earnings report and increase in dividend support a positive sentiment and potential short-term rally in the stock price.
