McDonald's delivered a strong Q1 performance with a 4% global comparable sales increase, driven by robust strategies like the Velocity Growth Plan. Managementâ€™s tone was positive, supported by effective initiatives such as digital upgrades, delivery services, and menu innovation. While guest traffic improvements are slow in the U.S., growth in international markets and strategic plans to enhance operations suggest a positive outlook. Given this, McDonald's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term as the company continues to execute its growth strategy effectively.
