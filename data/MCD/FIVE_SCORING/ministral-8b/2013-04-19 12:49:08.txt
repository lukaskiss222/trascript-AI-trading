### Analysis

The McDonald's Q1 2013 earnings call revealed several key points that will likely impact the company's stock price in the short term:

1. **Mixed Performance and Economic Challenges**: The company reported a 1% decline in global comparable sales, which was influenced by economic challenges and unfavorable weather conditions. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with continued high unemployment rates and austerity measures in Europe and soft economic conditions in APMEA.

2. **Market Share and Value Initiatives**: Despite the economic headwinds, McDonald's has been successful in maintaining and growing market share. The company's focus on value initiatives and new product launches, such as McWraps and Egg White Delight, has helped drive sales and market share. However, the company acknowledges that continued economic challenges and macroeconomic pressures will continue to impact performance.

3. **Operating Margins**: The company's operating margins declined in the first quarter, driven by higher labor and other operating costs. This is expected to continue throughout the year, although the company expects margins to improve as sales comparisons ease.

4. **Investment in Growth**: McDonald's remains committed to its long-term growth strategy, including investments in new restaurants and modernizing existing ones. The company expects to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 in affiliated and developmental license markets.

5. **Foreign Currency Translation**: The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has negatively impacted the company's first-quarter results. The company expects this to have a minimal impact on second-quarter earnings, but the full-year impact is expected to be $0.01 to $0.02.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on McDonald's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed performance, continued economic challenges, and the impact of foreign currency translation. However, the company's long-term growth strategy and focus on value initiatives and new product launches suggest that the stock may stabilize or even rally in the longer term. Given the current economic environment and the company's strategic focus, the stock is likely to remain volatile in the short term.
