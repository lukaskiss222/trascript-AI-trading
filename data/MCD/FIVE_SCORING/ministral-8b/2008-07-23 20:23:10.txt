### Analysis

The McDonald's earnings call presented a mixed picture. While the company reported strong comparable sales and margins, the outlook for commodity costs, particularly beef and chicken, was concerning. The executives highlighted the volatility in beef prices due to external factors like the Russian beef ban and the weaker dollar, which could lead to higher costs in the second half of the year. Additionally, the company's strategy of refranchising restaurants was noted as a long-term growth plan but might have short-term implications on margins.

### Conclusion

The short-term outlook for McDonald's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the uncertainty surrounding commodity costs and the potential impact on margins. The company's ability to manage these costs and adapt its pricing strategy will be crucial in the coming weeks. However, the strong performance in the second quarter and the company's long-term growth plans suggest that the stock could stabilize or even rally if the commodity cost pressures ease.
