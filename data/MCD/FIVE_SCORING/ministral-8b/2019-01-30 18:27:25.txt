**Analysis:**

McDonald's reported strong sales and guest count growth in 2018, with global comparable sales increasing 4.5% and guest counts growing for the first time since 2012. The company's performance was driven by its Velocity Growth Plan and Experience of the Future (EOTF) initiatives. However, the company expects some headwinds in 2019 due to labor costs, EOTF-related depreciation, commodity pressures, and foreign currency translation. The company also expects to complete about 2,000 EOTF projects in the U.S. in 2019, which will contribute to a lower average cost per project. The company's outlook for 2019 includes continued growth in delivery and digital channels, as well as a renewed focus on breakfast and drive-thru operations in the U.S. The company also expects to return about $25 billion to shareholders over the next three years.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on McDonald's stock price is likely to be positive, as the company continues to execute its growth strategy and expects to deliver strong financial results in 2019. However, investors should be aware of the potential headwinds in 2019 and the company's reliance on successful execution of its growth initiatives. The company's commitment to investing in its restaurants and digital channels, as well as its focus on improving the customer experience, should continue to drive growth and shareholder returns.

**Rating:** 2
