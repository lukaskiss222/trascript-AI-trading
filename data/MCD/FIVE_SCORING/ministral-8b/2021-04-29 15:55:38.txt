**Analysis:**
McDonald's reported strong Q1 results, with global comp sales and revenues surpassing Q1 2019 levels, driven primarily by the US market. The company's focus on digital, delivery, and drive-thru, along with successful menu launches like the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, has contributed to this growth. Management expressed optimism about the future, with plans to continue investing in these areas. However, concerns about labor shortages and potential headwinds from reopening dining rooms were acknowledged. The company's strategy to accelerate the arches and its renewed focus on core values and customer experience are likely to drive continued growth.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to strong Q1 results, optimistic guidance, and the company's focus on digital and menu innovation. However, potential headwinds from labor shortages and reopening dining rooms could temper the stock's performance in the near term. The stock is likely to remain volatile but is expected to benefit from the company's long-term growth strategy.
