Based on the provided transcript from McDonald's July 23, 2012, Investor Conference Call, the following analysis is provided:

**Analysis:**

1. **Performance vs. Expectations:** McDonald's reported a 6% increase in system-wide sales in constant currencies for the second quarter, which was slightly above the consensus estimate. However, the company's same-store sales growth was slower than expected, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.

2. **Management's Tone:** Management maintained a positive tone, emphasizing their ability to navigate the challenging economic environment and their focus on long-term strategies. They expressed confidence in their ability to grow the business and continue to deliver value to shareholders.

3. **Guidance Updates:** McDonald's did not provide specific guidance for the third quarter or the full year. However, they did mention that they expect a double-digit increase in G&A expenses due to the upcoming Summer Olympics and Paralympic games in London.

4. **External/Macro Influences:** The company acknowledged the impact of the ongoing global economic challenges, including declining consumer confidence and increased competition. They also mentioned the potential impact of healthcare costs on their P&L.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed performance, the positive tone of management, and the lack of specific guidance, the short-term impact on McDonald's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The company's ability to navigate the challenging economic environment and their focus on long-term strategies should provide some support, but the slower-than-expected same-store sales growth and the potential impact of healthcare costs may weigh on the stock.

**Rating:** 0
