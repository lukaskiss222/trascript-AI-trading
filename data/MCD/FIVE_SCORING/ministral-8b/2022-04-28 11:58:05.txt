**Analysis:**

McDonald's reported strong Q1 results, with sales up nearly 12% globally, driven by a 20% increase in international-operated markets (IOM) and a 3.5% increase in the U.S. The company highlighted growth in digital channels, delivery, and chicken sales as key drivers. Despite macroeconomic challenges, including inflation and supply chain issues, McDonald's remains optimistic about its future. The company's digital strategy, including MyMcDonald's Rewards, is a significant growth engine, with digital sales accounting for over 30% of system-wide sales in the top six markets. The stock is likely to see short-term pressure due to the uncertainty around the Russia-Ukraine conflict and potential impacts on consumer sentiment. However, the company's long-term growth prospects remain strong, driven by its digital transformation and strategic focus on key menu items.

**Conclusion:**

The stock is expected to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty around the Russia-Ukraine conflict and potential impacts on consumer sentiment. However, the company's long-term growth prospects remain strong, driven by its digital transformation and strategic focus on key menu items.
