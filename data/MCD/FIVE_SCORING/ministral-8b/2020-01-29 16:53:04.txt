The earnings call for McDonald's Corporation revealed strong performance in 2019 with significant sales and earnings growth. The company's Velocity Growth Plan has been successful in driving growth and improving customer satisfaction. However, there are some challenges ahead, including intensifying competition and potential labor cost increases. The company's guidance for 2020 suggests that growth may slow down slightly, but it remains confident in its ability to deliver high-single-digit EPS growth. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainty around the competitive environment.
