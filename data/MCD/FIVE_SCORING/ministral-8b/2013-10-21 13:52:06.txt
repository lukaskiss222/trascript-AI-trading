### Analysis

The McDonald's earnings call for the third quarter of 2013 revealed a mixed bag of results. While the company achieved strong growth in operating income and earnings per share, comparable sales growth was modest, particularly in the U.S. and APMEA markets. The company's focus on affordability, menu innovation, and customer experience was evident, but the overall macroeconomic environment and competitive pressures were significant challenges.

### Key Points

1. **Comparable Sales Growth**: The U.S. and APMEA markets showed weaker performance, with comparable sales growth at 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. This was attributed to heightened competitive activity and macroeconomic pressures.
2. **Affordability and Menu Innovation**: The company emphasized affordability and menu innovation, with the introduction of new products like Mighty Wings and McWraps. However, these efforts did not fully offset the overall industry trends.
3. **Franchise Margin Growth**: The franchise margin percentage declined due to weaker comparable sales, but the company expects this to improve as sales comparisons ease.
4. **G&A Expenses**: The company expects G&A expenses to decline by 2% to 3% in constant currencies due to lower incentive-based compensation and sponsorship costs.
5. **Future Outlook**: The company expects fourth-quarter sales to remain relatively flat, with no significant changes in margins. The outlook for 2014 was cautiously optimistic, with a focus on continued menu innovation and customer experience improvements.

### Short-Term Implications

Given the mixed results and the company's cautious outlook, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure. The lack of significant upside in sales growth and the ongoing challenges in the U.S. and APMEA markets may weigh on investor sentiment. However, the company's focus on affordability, menu innovation, and customer experience provides some reassurance for long-term growth.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed results and the ongoing challenges in key markets. The company's strategic focus on affordability and menu innovation provides some long-term potential, but the immediate challenges may continue to weigh on the stock.
