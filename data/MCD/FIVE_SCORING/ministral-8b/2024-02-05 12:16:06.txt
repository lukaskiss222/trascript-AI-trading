**Analysis:**

McDonald's reported strong Q4 results, with global comp sales growth of 9% and positive traffic across all segments. The company's Accelerating the Arches strategy has driven over 30% comparable sales growth since 2019. However, the company faces challenges, including the impact of the war in the Middle East on its IDL segment and potential boycotts in IOM markets. Management expects 2024 comp sales growth to moderate to 3% to 4% in the U.S. and IOM segments, with IDL sales expected to remain negative until there is a resolution in the Middle East. The company projects an operating margin of mid to high 40% in 2024, driven by top-line growth and franchise margin performance. The company plans to open more than 2,100 restaurants in 2024, with about 500 in the U.S. and IOM segments and more than 1,600 in the IDL segment, including about 1,000 in China. The company expects to generate strong cash flow in 2024, with free cash flow conversion in the 90% range.
