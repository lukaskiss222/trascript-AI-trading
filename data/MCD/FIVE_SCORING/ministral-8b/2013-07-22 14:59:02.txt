Based on the earnings transcript, McDonald's Corporation reported mixed results for the second quarter of 2013, with revenues, operating income, and earnings per share all growing despite a challenging global economic environment. The company's U.S. sales were up 1% and operating income was flat, while comparable sales in Europe were down 10 basis points and in Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa were down 30 basis points. However, the company's margins were negatively impacted by higher labor and commodity costs, and it expects the remainder of the year to remain challenging due to ongoing global economic headwinds and competitive activity. The company's management team expressed confidence in their ability to drive future performance and maintain market share in the face of these challenges. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
