### Analysis

The earnings call for McDonald's revealed a company in transition, with a new CEO, Stephen Easterbrook, focusing on a turnaround plan. The company's first quarter results showed a decline in comparable sales, with significant negative impacts from the APMEA region, particularly Japan. The U.S. market also showed disappointing results, with comparable sales down 2.6%. The turnaround plan, scheduled for May 4, is expected to outline strategic changes to address these challenges.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on McDonald's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, given the disappointing Q1 results and the uncertainty around the turnaround plan. The market is anticipating significant changes and may react negatively if the plan is perceived as insufficient or not well-received by franchisees and analysts. However, the stock could rally if the turnaround plan is seen as robust and aligns with market expectations.
