At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation there will be a question and answer session for investors. At that time investors only may ask question by pressing \u201c*\u201d \u201c1\u201d on their touchtone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Shaw you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw Vice President and Investor Relations: Thank you. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us today. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, James Skinner; and Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Paull. Also joining us by phone for Q&A is Chief Operating Officer, Michael Robert. Michael is with our owner-operated leadership at a regularly scheduled offsite meeting to discuss the plan to win. Jim will discuss the progress that we have made against our strategies as well as the priorities he laid out during his tenure as CEO, 2005 highlights and 2006 strategies and a discussion of plans for our company-operated restaurant. Matt will highlight some of the ownership changes we plan to make. He will also outline steps we would take to provide more information to investors about the performance of our company-operated restaurant. I will then comment on our current operating results and look ahead to 2006. Then we have time to take your question. As always this conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay. The forward-looking statements which appeared in today\u2019s earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on this call. But the earnings release in our 8-K with supplemental financial information are available on www.investor.McDonald\u2019s.com as our reconciliation\u2019s of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call today to the corresponding GAAP measures, and I would now like to turn it over to Jim.\nJames Skinner, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Mary Kay and good morning everyone, we appreciate your participation and interest in this call. On this earnings call last year we reported our standard results for 2004, at that time Mike committed that we would build on our success in 2005. We delivered on that commitment, 2005 was a very solid year for McDonald\u2019s. Our performance resulted from an intense focus on our customers, disciplined execution of our plan to win, continued brand strength and system alignment. You remember on that same call I outlined my priorities for my tenure as CEO of this great brand. Long-term profitable growth for our system and shareholders, talent management; and leadership development to support that growth in balanced, active lifestyles. We have made excellent progress in each of these areas. For the third consequent year we grew sales in profit. Comparable sales increased 4.2% for the quarter and 3.9% for the year. Revenues increase 4.5%in the fourth quarter and reached a record high for the year at more than $20 billion. EPS was $0.48 for the fourth quarter and $2.04 for the full year. Our cash flow statement is not yet finalized, but I can tell you that we expect to have another very strong year of cash flow performance. This financial success enabled us to enhance shareholder value by recurring a significant amount of cash to shareholders. In 2005 we increased our annual dividend by 22% nearly tripling the payoffs since 2002. Additionally share repurchases were ramped up this year to $1.2 billion. In 2006 and 2007 combined we planned to return another $5 billion to $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchasing. Bottomline our actions approve our commitment to building long-term value and you can count on this leadership team to continue acting in the best interest of our system and shareholders. Turning to talent management and leadership development, we\u2019ve focused on having the right people in the right places with the right skills and this continues to payoff for McDonald\u2019s. We have a strong and deep leadership match. We continually cultivate and promote talent and we have a robust succession planning process for all key leadership positions around the world enabling us to act quickly when we need to. Over the past year we placed new leadership in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada and here. Thanks to our effective talent management these dynamically leaders did not miss a beat and are driving the results you see today. In the area of balanced lifestyles we are committed to offering many choice and variety, promoting importance, the importance of physical activity and providing nutrition information. This is important to our customers and it is important to us. Two years of diligent work culminated in 2005 with the announcement that we will now provide nutrition information on our food packaging. This is a first for the quick service restaurant industry. Our new packaging will launch at the February Winter Olympics in Italy and by the end of 2006 it will be in the 20,000, that\u2019s 20,000 restaurants worldwide. In 2005 we also launched several new menu items around the world including premium chicken sandwiches in the U.S., new salad varieties in Europe, more Happy Meal\u2122 Choice in Asia, new chicken sandwiches in Latin America and much more. In terms of priorities I established as a CEO I believe we made great progress and I am confident we will continue our momentum in all three areas. In 2006 I intend to focus more of my time on our achievement of our long-term profitable growth. This means keeping our system aligned around our plan to win and its five strategic imperatives: People, Products, Place, Price, and Promotion. They are the fundamental drivers of our success in the foundation for long-term profitable growth, and there is tremendous room to grow market share and profit under each imperative. Our place strategy will target convenience in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. This includes extended hours in the appropriate markets, and an aggressive drive-through strategy to capitalize on increased automobile usage. If you can just take China for example there were more than 2 million new cars on the road in 2004 with 15 % more expected each year. With this increase spending power and mobility comes a faster pace of life and demand for greater convenience. The McDonald\u2019s drive-through then becomes a perfect dinning option. We opened the first ever drive-through in China last November and now have a total of three in the marketplace. These drive-throughs are outperforming the market average in sales and guest counts and will profit from our first mover advantage by opening 12 more this year. Our price strategy uses a sustained value platform to bring in more customers. In Europe we are seeing traction and success with programs that combined everyday value with a strong trade-off strategy. In Germany this balanced approach resulted in higher guest counts, comparable sales and margins. In the United States our products strategy is aimed at increasing our share of the rapidly growing chicken market, a $22 billion business. Consumption of chicken in the United States has increased nearly 40% over the past five years and we are seizing this opportunity. For example, with the launch of our \u2018premium\u2019 chicken sandwich line we are selling about 20% more chicken sandwiches at a premium price, which provides a nice balance with our everyday affordability platform, the Dollar Menu. This year we are adding to our chicken line with new spicy chicken premium sandwiches and Asian chicken premium salads. All of these diverse strategies are part of a holistic plan incorporating all five piece of our plan to win that will continue to generate growth and deliver shareholder value. Now I want to switch gears and talk about our company-operated restaurants. As you know there is a lot of interest in the accountability of McCopco restaurants and many opinions about the balance of company-operated and franchise restaurants. Let me tell you where we stand. First we absolutely believe that every restaurant McCopco or otherwise needs to be accountable for strong financial performance and deliver a great customer experience. In 2006 we intend to create more transparency around that McCopo performance. Second we are committed to franchising, McDonald\u2019s as you know is a franchising company and we will always be a franchising company. At the same time we believe it is critical to own and operate a certain number of restaurants, restaurants that we hold accountable for delivering strong financial results. We call it \u201cskin in the game\u201d. We firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor, credible in providing restaurant operations support and coaching in delivering the bottomline as well as the topline and credible in shaking or sharing the risks and rewards. In short we will continue to own and operate restaurants to better the McDonald\u2019s system and to deliver shareholder value. Having said that it\u2019s reasonable to ask the question, what\u2019s the right balance? This is something we continually manage and we will manage in the future. We believe we have the right balance in the United States, Australia, France and Russia for example just a few markets with strong margins and returns. But as we said before we also believe some of the roughly 8,000 McDonald\u2019s restaurants we currently own would be better certain to answer franchisees. We talked about this at our Analyst Meeting last September. Over the past year we have identified markets where our customers, system and shareholders will benefit from the entrepreneurial spirit of franchisees who can optimize the market\u2019s potential. But we will seek a better balance in the right way by being thoughtful and thorough. It will not be wholesale transaction that will not serve anybody\u2019s best interest. Additionally we are looking at ownership in certain markets, we have identified about 15 to 20 countries where we will pursue converting ownership to developmental licenses or DL\u2019s as we say. A DL structure enables a local entrepreneur to use their capital, their real estate and their local knowledge to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long-term. In a DL arrangement McDonald\u2019s collects royalty but invests no capital. They currently have 32 DL markets around the world and experience great success with this model. We believe this is the best approach in markets where the pie isn\u2019t big enough to support both McCopco and franchise restaurants. We are confident these ownership plans will increase value and Matthew Paull will talk about this in detail in a moment. To close I want to go back to where I began by repeating what I said a year ago. We are firmly focused on our customers and restaurants. Our system is aligned and committed to growing the business through our plan to win and we maintain our commitment to financial discipline in delivering shareholder value. As a result I am confident that 2006 will be another strong year for McDonald\u2019s. Thank you. Now I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Paull.\nMatthew Paull, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. In 2005 we delivered against our stated annual target of system wide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%, operating income growth of 6%to7% and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens. These targets continue to be appropriate and achievable for a company of our size. Notably over the past three years our comp sales margins and returns have all improved, with enhanced our financial strength and grown cash flow to even higher levels. All of this is a direct result of our focus and alignment on growing the business by being better not just bigger. But there is clearly more that we can do. We will get better as being better through continued efforts under the five P\u2019s and by evolving our ownership mix to best serve our business needs, our customers and our shareholders. As Jim said we are firmly committed to franchising. It is our historic foundation and the best way to grow our business going forward. The alignment we have with our operators, for example contributed to a 150 basis point improvement in franchise margin as a percent of revenues over the past three years. While we are deeply committed to franchising we do operate a minority of restaurants as McCopco because we believe it makes us a more credible and more effective franchisor. However as Jim just pointed out just a few minutes ago that does not give McCopco a pass on financial performance. Lets talk about the performance of the 15% of the U.S. restaurant base that we operate as McCopco. Profits as a percentage of sale in our U.S. franchise restaurants trend about a point and half higher than in our company-operated restaurant. We\u2019ve closely examined our mystery shop scores in the U.S. and the differences are minimal. So it is not operations driving the performance difference but there are differences that relate to the motivation and skill sets of an independent entrepreneur and others that are inherent in the way of our businesses are structured. First and foremost the independent entrepreneur who owns an average of 3 to 4 restaurants is highly motivated to drive sales and profit after all their livelihood depends on it. Franchisees as you all know are in the restaurant everyday, they make quick changes based on immediate needs. They note their competition they note their trading areas are very close to the day-to-day operations and obviously more connected to the local community then any large public company can possibly be. Structurally franchisees as small businessmen and woman have certain cost advantage for example they have a great feel of flexibility in designing their employee benefits while large U.S. based public company are required by law to provide similar benefits for all employees whether working at headquarters or restaurants. Similarly regarding insurance a large public company with thousands of restaurants is not as nimble as small entrepreneurs who can pick and choose among carriers capturing cost advantages. These three differences explain the vast majority of the small gap between McCopco and franchise stores in the U.S. We earn excellent returns in our U.S. McCopco business. Even after imputing a 13% rent and service fee these returns are well above our costs to capital. While our U.S franchisees on average perform slightly better than McCopco, none of the barriers to improve performance I just described is removed by substituting a new publicly owned McCopco for our current structure. As you know there has been a good deal of debate surrounding our McCopco restaurants. The idea of McCopco IPO has been raised along with the suggestion that such a step would improve transparency resulting in better performance and increase shareholder value. As you also know, we have rejected the idea of a McCopco IPO because we firmly believe it will not deliver the value already been created by our current strategy, that McDonald\u2019s plan to win. We put that strategy in place in early 2003, since then we\u2019ve recorded 32 consecutive months of positive global comparable sales, our share price has nearly tripled and we\u2019ve returned more than $4.2 billion dollars to shareholders by dividends and share buybacks. To state the obvious, Mc Donald\u2019s is on a bit of a role; having said this, we certainly know there is resting on pass burrow which is why we continue to evolve our business to make it stronger. But the key work here is Evolve, we do not believe in McCopco IPO is evolutionary nor is it necessary. Are we committed to significantly reducing the number of our company owned restaurants? Certainly, but as Jim said, we intend to do it in the right way and in markets where it makes the most sense to make changes. And IPO has been served up as a panacea, believe me it is not. From our own experience with the McDonald\u2019s Japan IPO in 2001, we know how much distraction and bureaucracy can be created, after all we owned 50% of the largest publicly traded restaurant franchise in the world. McDonald\u2019s Japan has 4000 restaurants and their public companies status does not protect them from economic volatility, commodity cost increases or competitive pressures in the marketplace. And just as importantly, we know that taking a large portion of our company-owned restaurants public does eliminate the structural differences or create the entrepreneurial spirit that exists with the franchisee. It merely creates an additional layer of complication and ultimately costs. For all these reasons, we concluded that an IPO of any portion of our company-operated restaurants will not improve performance in the McCopco. We believe there are better ways to accomplish this. We recognize opportunities for improvement exist in many markets, as part of our regular business review, we evaluate approaches that best promotes profitability. Today we have more than 9000 company-operated restaurants globally including 1000 operated by our partner brands Chipotle and Boston market. I want to focus today on our 8000 McDonald\u2019s company-owned restaurants. 2100 of these are in the US with strong margins and return. Another 900 are in Germany, France, Russia and Australia also with strong margins and return. These markets, which comprise about 40% of our company-owned restaurant base strongly contribute to our result and make us a better franchisor. No significant changes are currently planned. In China and Brazil, where we have a combined 1100 company-owned restaurants, franchise was either do not exist or are more or less unenforceable, so again franchising opportunities are not currently available. But we have about 800 company-operated restaurants in the UK, consistent with what we discussed in our Analyst Meeting in September, we will begin refranchising some McCopco in the UK this year. Currently the UK is 63% company-operated. The goal is to get something less than 50%. We have not yet determined exactly how far below 50% we will get or how long it might take us to get there. But remember we are starting in the UK with a relatively small owner operator base, as the base grows and as we gain experience with the refranchising strategy, the pace should accelerate. Earlier you heard Jim talk about our Developmental License or DL strategy. This is an excellent opportunity to evolve our ownership structure and capture the structural and motivational advantages that I mentioned earlier. Over the next three years, we planned to convert 15 to 20 additional countries or 1500 restaurants representing about 1.5 billion in sales. These restaurants also represent about $1.6 billion in combined net investments, generate approximately $60 million in net operating losses and account for nearly $100 million in G&A and $50 million of maintenance CapEx annually. Significantly, when we convert this group of restaurants to developmental licensees, the results we currently report from these markets would be replaced overtime with the royalty based solely on the percentage of sales and our capital requirements will be eliminated. The effect of this DL initiative is to put significant number of restaurants in the hands of entrepreneurs who can keep them locally relevant, improve returns overtime, protect their brand and continue their growth without any use of McDonald\u2019s capital. Please keep in mind it takes time to find the right developmental license partner. In the first three quarters of 2005, we added two countries and 325 restaurants to the list of markets using a developmental license ownership structure. Increasing total DL countries from 30 to 32 or on establishing DLs in these two additional countries began two years ago. Overtime, we expect to significantly reduce the number of company-operated restaurants from the current 27%, putting more restaurants in the hands of small entrepreneurial local businessmen and women. In this process, markets like China who remain primarily company-operated in the near-term while we await the evolution of China\u2019s franchising and property laws and continue to develop a pool of talented franchisees. So those are the highlights of our plans for refranchising and development licensing. Now lets return to McCopco performance. We believe in accountability, in incentives, type of results and in transparency. Three years ago, as a lot of you know, we reorganized US McCopco to operate as a separate business reporting to one McCopco Vice President in each US division. At that time, Ralph Alvarez led a team to determine which McCopco\u2019s we could run well and which should be refranchised. Since that time, compensation and incentives for all non-store level employees in US McCopco are directly tied to McCopco\u2019s operating income. U.S. McCopco\u2019s store managers earn bonuses again tied directly to the profitability of their individual restaurants. We have seen the benefit of these simple organizational changes and improved McCopco profitability, margins and returns in the US. Ralph Alvarez who is now President of McDonald\u2019s North America has begun a similar process in Canada. We will look at which of Canada\u2019s 500 McCopco\u2019s restaurants we can run well and which should be franchised. We\u2019ll organize personnel around their revised structure and implement incentives tied directly to the operating income of McCopco in Canada. We will consider similar changes in other countries where appropriate. On a separate but related topic, we believe we will find the way to supplement our disclosures regarding company operated restaurant performance, of course any information provided must be allowed by disclosure guidelines and must not be misleading meaning, there should be a solid foundation for any imputed data we give you. Let me be clear, the way we report McCopco results today is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and with how the rest of our industry reports results allowing for comparisons across our industry. Our intent is to provide more information so investors can better understand the results of the company-operated restaurant as if they were operated on a standalone basis. Because these contemplated disclosures could be considered proforma, we will probably provide you the components and let all of you in the investment community do the math. We are targeting disclosures of this additional information in our 10-K, which will be filed in about six weeks. The bottomline is more information, which we welcome. We will let you and our investors to decide how best to value our cash flows. So to conclude, our objective over the next several years is to lower the number of our company-owned restaurant and provide more information in the process. Rest assured, we will do this in the right way, when and where it make sense, the best sense for our system and our shareholders. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Mary Kay, who will comment on our current operating result and look ahead into \u201906.\nMary Kay Shaw Vice President and Investor Relations: Thanks Matt. Overall we delivered a strong quarter of positive result. Our focus on the plan to win and our alignment generated guest count increases and solid comparable sales growth for both the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter franchise margins, as a percentage of revenue continue to be strong, increased nearly 100 basis points to 80.3%. The US business drew much of this improvement. Consolidated company operated margins although a smaller contributor to overall margin dollars are an indicator of the restaurant level health of the business. Company-operated margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies for the quarter and more flat as a percent of sales. US company-operated margins as a percent of sales remain strong at 19.1% for the quarter. These margins were positively impacted by an adjustment to our current year estimates of profit sharing and store manager incentive. This was partly offset by higher beef cost, higher labor and higher occupancy cost including utilities. In the US beef was up about 8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the year, up slightly from last quarter\u2019s expectation, we are expecting cost for beef as well as chicken and cheese to be flat in 2006. Utility cost, which represent about 3% of sales for the average traditional restaurants rose approximately 9% this year. We are anticipating increases again in 2006 and have plans in place to address utility cost increases and to improve energy efficiency in the restaurant overtime. To continue our US momentum in 2006 we will introduce two new chicken products and re-image approximately 1400 restaurants. We will continue our focus on improving service and providing a great customer experience in the restaurant. Turning to Europe\u2019s company operative margin for the quarter, strong sales in Germany and Russia were offset by weak performance in UK and higher beef cost across Europe. Beef cost across Europe increased about 6% in the fourth quarter impacting margins by about 30 basis points. For the year European beef prices were about up 14% over the last year. Looking forward we expect beef cost to be up slightly in the first quarter of \u201806 and basically flat for the year, yet to face by the UK are longer-term and will take time to resolve. We have plans in place to drive improvement including refranchising company operated restaurant, wide range in consumer communications to further build trust and enhancing the customer experience through promotions like monopoly and tie ends to the World Cup. In September we successfully launched Toasted Deli sandwiches in the UK. We have opportunities for greater frequency and awareness with our customers and therefore we are planning some advertising rehabs to remind customers in the UK they have more reasons to visit Mc Donald\u2019s as we now offer more variety. Moving to Asia-Pacific this segment has generated another quarter of positive comparable sales primarily driven by Australia and Japan. Company operated margins declined 30 basis points for the quarter primarily due to negative comp sales in China and weak results in South Korea. We remain excited about the opportunities in China, a growing market with 1.3 billion people. This tested value of its past year and are confident we are on the right track with the balance of the premium products and value menu. We\u2019ve also added real estate expertise to improve our sight selection process and our global supply chain is working on efficiency initiative to help reduce costs all of which should lead to improved margin. In 2005 we opened about a 100 restaurants in China and we will open approximately 125 in 2006. Worldwide we will continue our emphasis on the remaining relevant to our customers, strengthening operations and maintaining capital discipline. In \u201806 we\u2019ve planned to reinvest about $1.8 billion, 50% allocated to existing restaurants and 40% for the new restaurants including approximately 800 new McDonald\u2019s restaurants primarily in the US, China, France and Russia. Jim mentioned our significant share repurchases, on this topic I know many of you have been disappointed as we have been as our share count has not declined despite all the stock repurchases. I would like to explain why this happened. We began 2005 with the higher share base for several reasons. First we were not in the market buying shares at the end of 2004. In addition, option exercises were much higher in the past two years at a combined 5% of the outstanding share base as the stock prices improved. As a result we did not offset the diluted impact of option exercises on share count, this is expected to taper off every time as have significantly reduced the number of options granted from about 2% of outstanding shares per year to about 0.7% of outstanding shares per year. We planned to be aggressive with share repurchases this year buying back a $1 billion worth in the first quarter of 2006 and have a portion already completed but we do expect to decrease in share count for 2006. In closing 2005 has been a good year and we have much to look forward to in 2006. We have additional opportunities for future growth and are confident we have the right plans in place. At this time I\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Please press \u201c*\u201d\u201d1\u201d if you have a question and \u201c# \u201ckey to remove yourself from the queue. To give more people an opportunity ask questions, please try to limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. First question is from Joseph Buckley at Bear Stearns\nQ - Joseph Buckley: Thank you. A couple of questions, I\u2019ll combine them into one on the company-operated McCopco information that you shared with us. I\u2019m curious if your study show that pricing is different in the McCopco stores versus franchise stores across the board. And could you walk through again the margin differential I think you indicated that your studies show franchise margins are about 1.5 points better than the company margins. And is that on a fully allocated basis for the rent of royalty. Just fill that out for us as much as you can please?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: Joe that would be on a totally allocated basis. What we are saying is, if you give a franchisee in McCopco the same opportunity, in general on average, the franchisee for all the reasons we\u2019ve sighted, will do a point and a half better profitability as a percentage of sale, that\u2019s why we are a franchising company, we recognize that. However, considering that and whatever it is you want to do with rents and services fees we are still earning a terrific return on US McCopco and it\u2019s making a much more effective more credible franchisor. On the issue of pricing overtime our McCopco prices are probably an average 3% or 4% below or franchisees their prices, bear in mind we are required by law to set our prices independently of where our franchise is that their prices and we never ever try to influence their pricing.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman Brothers.\nQ- Jeffery Bernstein: Thanks very much. Just a question on competitive US landscape. I think that most of your competitors have been following the same, their approach is the higher quality helps your leading options, and you seem strength I guess by a lot of these peers. Just wondering if you could talk about, just the strength in the overall QSR segment, what do you think this category momentum is sustainable? Also just wondering if you could see the overall category growing, or is, think quick service taking share from the segments, I wonder if you could size up the promotional environment? That will be great. Thanks.\nA- James Skinner: Jeff this is Jim Skinner, I\u2019ll start with the headline and then Mike Roberts may want to contribute from cost side location. First of all we are so excited about our opportunities in the quick service marketplace and the informal leading marketplace, so we\u2019ve continue to grow share. I think that\u2019s important as to whether that share is high growth or whether that share comes from our competitors I can only reflect upon what appears to be a rather stagnant performance in the overall marketplace rather than to quick service but informal eating out marketplace, an opportunity continues to grow. And our focus on the customers and restaurants and our plan to win and our tactic seem to driving share growth for us. Mike, did you want to...\nA- Michael Robert: Yeah thanks Jim, Jeff this is Mike. QSR US is planning to grow in the neighborhood of 3-5%, which is robust. You know the 3-year comp for the US, \u201803 at 96, \u201804 at 64 and now at \u201805 a 44 comp for the year. So we continue to grow our market share. The marketplace is growing, but we are growing faster than the market, it is a combination of all of the initiatives we have spoken about from late night to breakfast to chicken to the new food Walnut Salad and of course the Dollar Menu, so progress continues.\nOperator: Thanks Mike. The next question is from John Glass at CIBC.\nQ- John Glass: Thanks. Could you comment a little bit on the European margins, it looks like their year-over-year decline is starting to abate, maybe it sounds like beef got better in the fourth quarter. Is there \u2013 could you maybe decompose it by market, is there anything that\u2019s moved significantly? And also I guess as your comments relating to the difference in the McCopco versus franchises, is that global or is that just the US and maybe if it is the US could you talk about, is that difference the same in Europe?\nA- Mary Kay: Hi, John this is Mary Kay, I will cover the Europe margin. Beef costs did abate, for the year beef cuts were up 14%, Europe only 6% in the fourth quarter so you know it\u2019s about 20-30 basis points different, so 50 basis points for the year and only about 30 basis points for the quarter. That was really the primary reason, I think UK was the main market that was pulling the margins down without the UK the margins would have been up in a pretty good way. And the UK is beginning to make some progress too, but the biggest challenges for them are labor. So the beef costs has helped the margins there. Matt, do you want to comment on the second part?\nA- James Skinner: John, on the second part of your question about, if we did a comparison of McCopco and franchise results, we have not done an exactly similar study in Europe but if we did, we think we\u2019d see a slightly larger gap on average, slightly larger gap. But it is, the general 51 different countries with 51 different stories, I would be quick to point out that that gap would be heavily influenced by what\u2019s going in the UK right now, where we have probably the biggest gap in Europe. We have already indicated that we are going to be doing re-franchising there. And also I want to point out that probably our best performing margin market in all of Europe is Russia, which is entirely company-operated, somewhere near 25%.\nA- Michael Robert: And on the pricing relationship, John, I would say that its probably similar in Europe, its important that though that we all use the same pricing tools, I encourage you to use the same pricing tools because the balance between affordability and driving opportunity for customers to experience McDonald\u2019s through prices so very important it has to be balanced against the profitability of the restaurant on each individual item and so, we spend a lot of time learning and using the tools around this but I would say that the pricing relationships probably about the same there as its here.\nOperator: Thanks, the next question is from Lawrence Miller with Prudential.\nQ - Lawrence Miller: Yeah, thank you, hi, nice to hear you guys. And one of the areas that was raised was higher G&A per store and I was wondering if you could explain why that is and if there is any opportunity there to bring that down. And then I was also curious with the company-operated stores with McCopco stores, did they tend to run higher unit volumes and if so did you adjust for that in your announcement and is that mainly because they maybe of better locations they have more expensive real estates so where is that offset?\nA - James Skinner: Oh Larry, this is James Skinner, and then Mike might want to comment on McCopco volumes but three years ago, or three and half years ago, when we set out the revitalization of the financial discipline around that revitalization, G&A reduction and discipline around the G&A spend of the organization was a critical piece of that. And but the focus on that G&A reduction was at the center and not on the field because the relationship that we have with our franchises and our company\u2019s restaurants relative to focus on our customers and our restaurants causes us to believe that it is important for us to have the support in the field relative to the day-to-day operations in that moment of truth to front counter drive-through for our customers and the best experience possible. So, we did not reduce the spend relative to the field but we focus more on the reduction here at the center and we do have higher volume because of that in my mind, we have a better customer experience because of that. And we are able to deliver on the plan to win in that expectation.\nA - Matthew H. Paull: Lawry this is Matt, I just want to ask you to recall that at our Analyst Day Meeting we made quite a point in this. We recognize that in our first store basis, our G&A spend is higher than the rest of the industry but the way we run the business as Jim was saying is very different than others. There\u2019s much more collaboration and engagement with our operators and probably more provisions of field support than you see with the other brands. We think that the collaboration and engagement process resulted in us making as a system much better decisions because of all the valuable inputs we get from our franchises. Very few other franchise systems operate that way, it is clearly a more expensive way. To operate, if you are just looking at the G&A line but when you look at the average unit volumes, our system drives probably double the average of the competitors. When you look at the store level cash flow, maybe almost the triple the level of the competitors, we think it\u2019s worth it and also we showed everybody at Analysts\u2019 Day on September 21st what the trend has been in G&A. We committed three years ago to reduce G&A as a percentage of system wide sales by about 10 basis points, here we delivered on at least that every year in the last three years and dramatically brought down our G&A\u2019s percentage of sales and the only thing that gotten the way this year was having to expense option.\nA - James Skinner: Mike, you do want to comment on the average volumes of the McCopco versus franchisees?\nA - Michael Robert: Jim, the only thing I would add is the average sales in the US now are over $2 million, 3.5 years ago they averaged about $1.6 million so significant increase and there is very little difference between an average McCopco annual sale and the average operated sale so they are roughly the same.\nA - Matthew H. Paull: And Larry when we sighted that 0.5 difference we did it using adjusting for differences in volumes, but hopefully that answers your question. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Wiltamuth at Morgan Stanley.\nQ \u2013 Mark Wiltamuth: Could you please comment on sales trends in chicken in your China market and if you could just talk about how the returns have changed over the last year there in your China unit, if they are getting better or worse?\nA - Michael Robert: I would say, the notion here is that obviously we got a full menu there laid up of beef and chicken, we are promoting beef at the moment and doing quite well, I would add, obviously with Avian Influenza there is significant concerns there as you have heard from our competitors but our chicken sales remain strong in China, and chicken and beef and pork are an important part of the Chinese diet and we offer all three. Thank you.\nA - Matthew H. Paull: And Mark, this is Matt on the returns issue, as you know we\u2019ve had a negative comp a large part of 2005 in China, the whole industry has and our comps probably aren\u2019t negative as some others, that has driven our returns down slightly, we are still very optimistic, we are not changing our opening plans and returns aren\u2019t just problematic there because the upfront investment to open a restaurant, this maybe a fourth of what it is in the US. So we are still very optimistic and we are proceeding with our opening plan. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Barish at Banc of America.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Barish: The question is in the kind of first quarter European promotional activity, last year you guys were a little bit more aggressive on the couponing the brand books is, is there anything you see out there promotionally that would either be positive or negative to margins in the European business here for the next few months?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: This is Matt, Andy. In Germany last year we had heavy couponing in January that we did not run this year, you could expect that to have a small negative effect on sales but probably a small positive effect on margins on a standalone basis for January in Germany. And we did the same thing in Europe, the brand coupon books have been pulled back this year, so the end result of that Andy is less discounting in this first quarter, our goal there as Mike Roberts has said many times, there is a holistic plan around all the things that we know that would drive the business and give our customers a better experience around the 5P\u2019s. That includes everyday affordability, that includes the balance between the affordability menu and premium sandwiches and premium items on the menu and we know what works, it is not just a matter of time and the execution I think relative to those marketplaces, and the consumer expectation being delivered.\nA - James Skinner: Jim I\u2019d just add for Andy, its much more of a focus on the premium products which is a tactic that we have now used the around the world very successfully continuing here in the US. We got a big tasty re-hit in France, we got the double QPC in Europe as well, the Pound Saver in the UK, much more activity related to cheese saga, in Germany all four price products that historically have done very well for us not only profitability wise but sales wise. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from John Ivankoe at J.P. Morgan.\nQ- John Ivankoe: Actually I wanted to have a lot of clarification actually on the DL strategy, I think there Kay, you threw out some numbers, 1500 restaurants at 1.5 billion sales in 15 to 20 countries, is that all company-operated?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: That is for all purposes, it is all company-operated.\nQ- John Ivankoe: Okay. And I think the numbers that you said, excluding $60 million pre-tax or net of year?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: $60 million is the operating income line of losses.\nQ- John Ivankoe: Okay, so it\u2019s the pre-tax, and then $100 million of G&A that- ?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: That would be included in that loss.\nQ- John Ivankoe: Do you have any sense what that G&A would go to, was it DL market?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: That G&A would be cut dramatically, I can\u2019t give you an exact number but it would be well well under half of what it is today.\nQ- John Ivankoe: And just one final one, hopefully this counts as one question. I mean do you think you can or just round numbers think you can sell your net investment at least a breakeven or perhaps gain or should we expect losses from that?\nA - Matthew H. Paull: John this is a very long and careful process. The first thing is to find the right partners. Somebody who believes in the brand has a long-term view and can make the brand and keep the brand locally relevant. We are not focusing on what the proceeds of selling might be but you have to bear in mind the information I gave you in deciding you know what you think we might be able to raise. We are not going to comment on individual markets or what we expect to raise in proceeds. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from David Kolpak at Victory Capital.\nQ- David Kolpak: Hi everybody. Recently several of your competitors have boosted their marketing focus on Dollar Menu in the US and I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any kind of a trend from consumer demand towards more value priced items, recently and are you assuming a slow down in average stated growth in the US in \u201906?\nA- Michael Robert: Yeah. David I would tell you that Dollar Menu in the US remains an important part of our portfolio. In terms of our advertising spend, it represents in a neighborhood of 10-15% of the total. We have a very robust calendar here with new food news like Spicy Chicken and then the new coffee initiative followed by the Asian salad in the spring. So the combination of everyday little price the Dollar Menu as well as new food news and great promotional activity like monopoly and I\u2019m loving it is plan for the \u201806 calendar. We would tell you that with higher energy cost and what have you related to consumer\u2019s pocket books. The Dollar Menu is a really important of our portfolio and we intend to continue, communicate to our consumers what great value is available at McDonald.\nA- James Skinner: And David I just have to say, this is Jim Skinner, I think that the customer relationship with our restaurants, it proves that they understand a good value and everyday affordability, the balance between that and other options they have on the menu and you know if our competitors pay attention to our customers, they understand that formula and it makes sense for them to pursue that.\nOperator: Our next question from Howard Penney at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Co.\nQ- Howard Penney: Thanks very much. Can we just walk through the process of how you decided on using the Developmental Licenses as a strategy of refranchising the stores and will this provide you best return versus other potential forms of franchising?\nA- James Skinner: Well I can start Howard thanks for your question. We of course have had a number of Development Licenses for a number of years now. And the reason for that is because some I guess we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to own company restaurants, we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to have enough pie in the marketplace for enough growth, the size of the market place for us to make that kind of investment and we didn\u2019t have enough opportunity really to have conventional franchising and therefore we chose the DL route where you\u2019d find a person who has some passion for the brand, they still have to train and develop to be good restaurant tourists, this is important for people to remember. But they also have the willingness to invest the capital, represent the brand and run the business effectively in those marketplaces, but it is a size related issue in terms of the marketplace. And then secondly the size of pie, and of course we make investments and bets in marketplaces and sometimes we go in there as a company operation and find out that we don\u2019t get the same kind of results on an overall basis that we might want to get and then it becomes better for that marketplace to be a Developmental Licenses we talked about the parameters of that earlier.\nQ- Howard Penney: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Oakes at Piper Jaffray\nQ- Peter Oakes: Hi good morning. I was actually hoping to follow-up on Howard\u2019s Developmental License questions. You know in the past you\u2019ve utilized joint ventures and obviously outright franchising. Can you articulate a little better on the developmental license program, how much capital is involved, the royalty stream that we might think of versus the alternatives and even the current Unicorn word stands here at the end of the year. Thank you.\nA - Matthew H. Paull: Peter, its Matt, to give you some perspective. When we go to developmental license structure, we are focusing a lot on what is the upside potential on the market versus the risk. And if we decide that that doesn\u2019t work to our favor and then having a local developmental license gives us an advantage in the marketplace, we go developmental license route. We\u2019ve made the most expensive use of it in the Mid East. James Skinner actually launched that program probably we have 15 or 20 markets in the Mid East on a developmental license program. And when you look there, none of our capital is at risk, we don\u2019t put any capital into the entity that\u2019s running the restaurant. We get a pure royalty and using the Mid East as an example, we probably collect royalties anywhere from 2% to 7% of sales and the G&A we spend to make sure that the brand is being presented in the right way and the standards are being met might run in 20%, 30% of the royalty that we collect. So that\u2019s the way we think about it, now we are going to be using to developmental license structures in other parts of the world we have already. If we are going to some new parts of the world and we can\u2019t predict exactly what royalty stream we will get. We are going to focus first and foremost on finding the right development licensee and frankly we would expect a lower loyalty to get the right person into the market running that business. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph Buckley of Bear Stearns.\nQ - Joseph Buckley: Hi thank you. Could you talk about, or just update us on the plans to refranchise units in UK, I think you mentioned 50 restaurants for this year, in that you mentioned that the DL deals was done last year, took a couple of years to, you have to finally come to formation, where are you in the pipeline on additional DLs, or would we like to see any this year?\nA- James Skinner: Joe, on the UK refranchising, I think we said that in our September Analyst Day meeting around 50, I think there\u2019s a chance we will end up getting more done but we don\u2019t want to say exactly how many. Part of this is trying to determine how quickly and how well our franchises in UK can absorb additional restaurants. The franchisee base there is not as big as in the US and the proportion of restaurants that are McCopco to the number of franchisees we have is not exactly what it want to be. But if see it working, we would move it along more quickly. On the pipeline issue, with respect to the developmental licenses, I want to say a few things, sometimes these things happen quickly and sometimes they take years, I do want to say that we have two officers working just about full time in this project. But remember we\u2019ve got 15 to 20 different countries on our list, we cannot predict whether this will be one a quarter or none for the first six quarters and then we\u2019ll complete eight of them all at once. It\u2019s just not something that we can predict but we wanted to let you know, what things will look like when we\u2019re done. We will not have capital invested in these markets, we will be collecting a royalty and we will be applying a small amount of G&A against that. Thank you. Operator: The next question is from David Palmer with UBS.\nQ - David Palmer: Thank you, this is a great call. I guess one last, I have two last ones if I could just fit in here, on the dividend, perhaps you can give us a thought or two as to what you will be thinking in the coming years about the key factors that we drive decisions on increasing a dividend perhaps faster than your earnings per share growth. And secondly on Coffee, I see the Gourmet coffee chains and Donuts chains are driving about a third in the US industry unit growth and you have the upcoming reformulations and re-launch and possibly you do so more things on Coffee down the road. Nationally you are not weak, you are not doing a co-branding of your coffee and I was wondering what your thoughts was there, why not co-brand and of course I\u2019ve realized that in New England you recently rolled out Newman\u2019s Own Green Mountain coffee, how are coffee and breakfast sales doing up there, is any learning\u2019s to project nationwide? Thanks\nA - James Skinner: David, this is James Skinner, I just make a comment on the dividend and then Matt may want to try, Mike I am sure you want to talk about your pet project on Coffee. Thanks Jim. But as you know, we are already committed to $5 billion to $6 billion over the next two years of return to shareholders over dividends and stock repurchase. And we take the dividend decision as you know somewhat later in the year and we will take off under advisement and relative to the ratios of the payoff that gets determined at that particular time relative to the nature of our share repurchase and dividend and return to shareholders. Matt, you want to say something else?\nA- Matthew Paull: Sure, David, I want to point out a couple of things. The payouts that will take place in \u201806 and \u201807 will probably end up being 100% of our net income when you think about it the way Jim just described it, dividend and share repurchase combined. When you look at how do you break that between the dividend and share buyback here are the factors that we consider. We absolutely consider how the market values dividend versus share buyback, that is a big factor. We consider flexibility obviously dividend is a quasi long-term commitment, we look at the strength of the business and finally it\u2019s a minor factor but it is a consideration what\u2019s going on with the tax law, treatment of dividends versus share repurchase. And Mike were you going to cover coffee?\nA- Michael Robert: Yeah thanks Matt. David as you mentioned premium coffee and specialty coffees are really important part of the American breakfast experience now. We\u2019ll be launching as I said a new premium Roast Coffee in the US and we are beginning to, it\u2019s rolling out as we speak with new cup, new lid and new graphics etc. We\u2019ll start promoting the end of February. The objective obviously is to increase both coffee and breakfast sales. We promoted coffee with McGriddles in April of \u201905 and improved our coffee sales and improved our breakfast sales. As you mentioned we have some locally relevant brands that are part of our chest sales, with Green Mountain and Boston and Seattle\u2019s Best in Seattle, they are part of our advertising plans beginning in February here in US as well. And then we have another 50 or so restaurants that have begun its sales on specialty coffees. And we know what an important play specialty coffees are. So a lot of activity related to coffee and we are optimistic about February\u2019s launch here in the US. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question from Larry Miller at Prudential.\nQ- Lawrence Miller: Yeah, my follow-up question was answered but can you just give us a sense Mike what the coffee percent of sales is right now in the US?\nA- Michael Robert: Larry, it\u2019s a small percentage overall. Our goal is to increase it, we promoted coffee with McGriddles as I said in April of 05 and my recollection is that\u2019s the first time we ever advertised our coffee in over 10 years. And so we are getting more active here and getting a lot of expertise built up in our many management teams and look for more from us on coffee.\nOperator: Okay, looks likely we are out of questions. So thanks everyone I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jim for a closing comment.\nJames Skinner, Chief Executive Officer: In closing let me just say thanks again everybody for your participation today. I want to reinforce our commitment to providing value for our customers, the McDonald\u2019s system and our shareholders. Our strategy of being better not just bigger is paying off. For three consecutive years our plan to win has delivered results and that momentum continues. We will continue to generate growth by executing our proven plan to win and optimizing our ownership and structuring relevant markets around the world. I am confident that 2006 will be another strong year for McDonald\u2019s. Thank you."}], "2007": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2006, "date": "2007-01-24 14:09:18", "content": "\nExecutives"}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-10-19 18:21:45", "content": "Executives: James A.

Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.  (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin.\n Mary Kay Shaw: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me on our call are Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner; Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Paull; and joining us from Hong Kong is Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez. This conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay later today via phone, webcast and podcast.  As always, the forward-looking statements that appear in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both the earnings release and our 8-K with supplemental financial information are available on investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Now, I would like to go ahead and turn the call over to Jim Skinner.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for being on the call.  I am excited to report that our momentum continues, with all of our area of the world business units contributing both to the top- and bottom-line.  In the third quarter, system-wide sales increased 8%, supported by solid guest count increases. Margins continued to grow. Operating income growth was up 12%, and earnings per share is $0.68, or 17% increase over the previous year. It is clear that we are satisfying our customers and, as a result, providing value to our shareholders.  As I see it, the trend is continuing. There is still substantial upside potential for us to grow our business around the world. It should come as no surprise that our core business strategy will remain to grow by being better, not just bigger. We will continue to execute this strategy through our Plan to Win. This approach has aligned our system and directed our resources and assets to deliver strong results for the past three-and-a-half years.  As you have heard me say many times, it is all about continuous improvement. Getting better at being better is how we will capitalize on the opportunity in the marketplace. We are intensifying our efforts in a few key areas. Most important is evolving the McDonald's experience to achieve even greater customer relevance. Our pipeline is filled with innovative solutions to customer needs in all areas of our Plan to Win.  For example, in the areas of food, work is underway to address our customers' desire for additional choices of Happy Meal entrees and beverages that will meet appropriate nutritional guidelines.  In service, we have a new POS system in 5,000 restaurants. In tests, it has improved order accuracy by 33% and allowed us to serve up to 13 additional cars per hour in the drive-thru.  In convenience, we are exploring various ways to increase capacity at the drive-thru, and making it easy for our customers to experience brand McDonald's.  There are many more examples but the point is, we have the right focus and resources in place to grow our market share by providing our customers with the most relevant solutions to meet and exceed their needs. We are also evolving our marketing to further strengthen our connection with customers and build greater trust. McDonald's is one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. The value of this trust is evident in the larger share of customer visits and higher average annual sales that McDonald's restaurants achieved versus our competitors.  But we can -- and we will -- do more. We believe the opportunity to build greater trust in our brand and the benefit of doing so is significant. We are focused on two key priorities to build this greater brand loyalty -- creating engaging break-through communications and enhancing McDonald's brand as it relates to the wellbeing of children.  Today, it is easy for people to opt-out and ignore marketing communications, so we will accelerate our efforts around creating advertising that breaks through the clutter and is engaging. We have broadened our marketing focus beyond television to include print, billboards, mobile communications, such as the U.K.\u2019s text message to win World Cup tickets and, of course, the Internet. The Internet is an important and effective medium for engaging customers.  For example, our global casting call last spring was entirely Internet-based, and it was a promotion where customers submitted photos and stories with a chance to be featured on our packaging. On a shoestring budget with no media support, this promotion drove 13 million hits to our website and received 70 million media impressions.  We have also created advertising targeted toward young adults, just for the Internet. One ad, that debates the proper pronunciation of Filet-O-Fish, has proved popular on YouTube, Yahoo! and Google Video. AdAge and AdCritic recently named this ad the \u201cPick of the Week\u201d. Our second priority is to further build brand trust by being a recognized leader in the area of children's wellbeing. We intend to be an ally of families by offering greater Happy Meal choices, which I talked about earlier, and educating parents about these choices and the relative nutritional value of our food.  As part of this effort, the U.S. now features Chicken McNuggets, Apple Dippers and milk in most every Happy Meal ad. In addition, we are recommitting 20% of our children's marketing budget toward communications that inspire kids to be more active, both physically and mentally.  We will pursue these priorities in an effort to build trust, which in turn enables us to grow guest counts, sales and profitability. In addition to operations and marketing initiatives, we are also focused on ownership structures that provide the best returns for our system and shareholders. This includes our efforts around franchising more of our restaurants in the U.K. to converting more markets to a developmental license structure. Of course, Matt is going to talk about this in a few minutes.  Of course, we are always looking at ways to leverage efficiencies and improve effectiveness in those areas we consider competitive advantages, such as supply chain and market. By focusing on these areas, we will provide even greater value and returns for our shareholders.  Last month\u2019s dividend and share repurchase announcement is a direct result of our current success and our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong results. As you may recall, we will increase our dividend this year by nearly 50%. That means since 2002, our shareholders have seen a 325% increase in their dividend -- one of the highest increases in the S&P 500. In addition, we committed to return at least $10 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this year through 2008.  Earlier this month, we completed our divestiture of Chipotle. This transaction was the right thing to do for both Chipotle and McDonald's. Chipotle will benefit from increased flexibility to pursue its own strategic objectives, and McDonald's customers and shareholders will benefit from our singular focus on brand McDonald's. Needless to say, I am excited about our future. We have tremendous momentum and we are poised to maximize the opportunities in the marketplace. By intensifying our focus and improving execution of our Plan to Win, I have no doubt that we will continue to generate strong results.  Helping me lead this charge is our newly-appointed President and Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez, who is in Hong Kong today. Ralph is a strong, results-oriented leader who has driven success in our business, both inside and outside the U.S. His passion for restaurant operations, deep understanding of the competitive landscape, focus on profitability, and proven track record make him the perfect person to help take McDonald's revitalization and accelerate our momentum to the next level. With that, I will turn the call over to my partner, Ralph Alvarez.\nRalph Alvarez: Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, I want to emphasize how proud I am to be partnered with Jim to lead brand McDonald's.  Our Plan to Win is working. We have business momentum. It remains our systems road map, and it will continue to drive results to the top- and bottom-line.  McDonald's third quarter consolidated results were strong, with comparable sales increase of 5.8%. That is 41 consecutive months of positive global comp sales growth.  Franchise margins of 81.2%, up 60 basis points.  Company-operated margins at 17.3%, an increase of 150 basis points versus the same quarter last year. We continued to add margin expansion, as a result of healthy sales growth with a good balance of increases in traffic and average check. I want to share with you some of what I have been doing recently.  Since assuming my new position, I have been spending time in the field and restaurants in our major markets, reviewing our 2007 to 2009 plans, and addressing opportunities for growth. I am focused on the incorporation of best practices across the globe and ensuring strong alignment around important, brand-defining elements.  Our brand is in different stages of development, but the right combination of convenience and branded affordability, coupled with locally relevant product news, has been and is a winning formula. Now, let me also share with you how Jim and I are looking at the business and what guides our thinking and decision making.  First, replication and consistency are key to our growth. Our ability to take an idea, scale it, and consistently deliver is a point of differentiation. We are rigorously reviewing processes and systems that allow our restaurants to handle changes in menu and operations faster and better than ever before.  Simple execution and fast replication are what customers want today from our brand, is the key to our success, and it is McDonald's strongest core competency. Second, we are setting up migration paths that enable us to handle these changes, both financially and operationally, from [corporate] leadership all the way down to each restaurant. Examples of this are restaurant re-imaging, operating system, and point of sale changes. Third, everything we do is filtered through individual restaurant level economics, to ensure we balance restaurant enhancements and profitability. Now, I would like to highlight what is driving the business around the world.  In the U.S., momentum continues with third quarter comp sales up 4.1%. Company-operated margins continue to be strong at 19% for the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points, despite higher average hourly rates, utility increases, and depreciation as a result of our re-imaging investments.  We are seeing specific success from breakfast, branded affordability, and chicken. Consumers love the new Chicken Snack Wrap. With a suggested price of $1.29, it is a great value and has exceeded our projections by 20%. Our profitable breakfast business had increases of 7% for the quarter, led by the leverage of this year's launch of premium roast coffee.  In addition to the significant growth from our existing restaurants, we will open about 200 new units in the U.S. this year.  I am confident in the strength of the U.S. business and the leadership of Don Thompson and Jan Fields. We have an experienced management team, strong owner-operators, and a momentum of growing guest counts. Now, moving on to Europe, we continue to be pleased with our progress. We delivered strong third quarter comp sales of 7.6% up.  September was the eighth month of consecutive positive comp sales for Europe. This resulted in company-operated margins increasing 220 basis points to 18.3%, the highest quarter in five years. The improvement occurred in all big three markets -- U.K., Germany, and France, and was partially offset by labor pressures.  The momentum in Europe is building, due to a focus on three key plan-to-win strategies -- improving our customer experience, building brand transparency, and increasing consumer relevance. In Germany, we are seeing success through the right balance of branded affordability, [menu] and recurring seasonal events like Asian and Mexican-themed promotions.  In France, we continue to see outstanding results. We are growing in a shrinking and formulating-out market. The French team is focused on brand relevance and building a strong connection with their customers. They, along with other European markets, saw excellent results from this summer's promotion that focused on our Extra Value Meals and featured special Coca Cola glasses.  In the U.K., we are starting to gain traction. We have now posted positive comps for the last six months, and the improvements are benefiting Europe's margins. The U.K. contributed almost 100 basis points to Europe's third quarter '06 company-operated margin improvement.  Now, the big three are not the only countries contributing to Europe's results. We continued to deliver strong, consistent performance in other parts of Europe, including Russia, Spain and Italy. Now, let's turn to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Their third quarter comp sales growth was plus 6.1%, led by Japan. We also generated a 150 basis-point increase in company-operated margins, primarily driven by China.  Our team in China is focused on executing the basics of the business and growing our brand equity. We are laying a strong foundation for the continued growth of our convenient strategy there. This means a movement to almost 50% of our new restaurant is being built with drive-thru\u2019s.  While building a drive-thru restaurant in China is costing us about $200,000 more U.S., we are achieving opening volumes that are tracking at least 250,000 higher than before -- clearly a good investment.  We are confident in the leadership of our China team and the opportunities that we will capture in this market. Bottom line, our plan is working. All major geographies are growing sales and returns.  As I mentioned earlier, I have spent the last few weeks with our global teams, as they finalize their 2007 through 2009 plans. I can tell you that it will be more of what is already working well.  It is a combination of a strong pipeline of innovative new menu items combined with everyday branded affordability and increased consumer conveniences, like extended and 24-hours, delivery, cashless and gift cards.  We continue to invest in our facilities, our operating systems and our people, so we truly can be better at being better. Our teams are motivated to continue to build on the foundations of the Plan to Win. Now, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Matt Paull.\nMatthew Paull: Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.  At the risk of sounding a bit like a broken record, our strategic focus on being better, not just bigger, continues to deliver strong results. Jim and Ralph already discussed the quarter's performance, so I will update you on our efforts to optimize our restaurant ownership mix, explain how we will account for the Chipotle split-off, and describe our plans to reduce share count. Last January, we outlined our intent to transfer ownership in 15 to 20 countries, with about 1500 restaurants, to developmental licensees over the next three years. As a reminder, we have successfully used the developmental license, or DL structure, for more than 15 years now, and currently have it in place in about 35 countries.  The DL structure aligns us with local entrepreneurs who know the local culture, business and legal environment. They use their capital and local expertise to build the brand. Under this arrangement, McDonald's collects a royalty, and invests no capital for new stores or for reinvestment.  In addition to the financial benefits from reduced capital intensity, improved returns, and a growing stream of royalties, this strategy enables our management team to focus most of its time and energy on the markets that can make the greatest difference.  This is an essential component of the being better, not just bigger, strategy. We are tailoring the ownership structures we use to the unique aspects and risk reward relationships in each of these markets. In fact, we now believe the DL structure is appropriate for an even larger number of countries and restaurants than originally contemplated. In aggregate, the markets now on our DL list account for about 2300 restaurants, and in 2005, represented: These 2300, mostly McOpCo restaurants, represent about $3 billion in combined net investment. This includes some $800 million in accumulated currency translation losses reflected as negative shareholders equity on our balance sheet. We do not expect any potential licensee to compensate us for these historical currency losses. In addition, if we are able to complete these transactions, we do not anticipate that sales proceeds will allow us to recover most of the remaining $2.2 billion in net book value.  Remember, these markets generated negative free cash flow in 2005, and that is before considering the royalty we will collect from potential licensees, and any additional capital commitments we will expect from these licensees.  Though we are aggressively pursuing the DL strategy, accounting rules do not allow us to record potential losses to bring asset-carrying values down to likely value at sale, until we conclude we are likely to complete a sale within 12 months, and we have a reasonable sales price estimate. Both of these criteria must be satisfied in order to apply what we call \u201cheld-for-sale\u201d accounting to our impairment testing.  The amount of any loss recorded if and when we cross the \u201cheld-for-sale\u201d threshold could be significant. Until then, we will continue to test these assets for impairments, in accordance with the \u201cheld-for-use\u201d accounting policy described in our 10-K. Separately, in the United Kingdom, we are making progress toward our goal of reducing the company-owned store count to about 50% by the end of '07. Our ultimate goal is to get this number below 50%. Through the third quarter, we have franchised, or entered into joint venture arrangements, for 100 company-operated restaurants in the U.K. This brings company-operated restaurant ownership down to 56% from 63% at the beginning of the year. As Jim mentioned, we completed the Chipotle split-off earlier this month. The gain from the exchange offer is about $500 million. This gain, and all Chipotle results, will be recorded as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter. All prior year Chipotle results will be presented in this manner as well.  As a result of the Chipotle exchange, we reduced shares outstanding by almost 19 million shares. This amount, plus year-to-date repurchases of 53 million shares, brings total shares acquired so far this year to nearly 72 million.  Now that the Chipotle exchange is over, we plan to resume buying back stock in the fourth quarter and, consistent with our previous guidance, we anticipate total shares outstanding at the end of '06 -- that is total, not average -- to decline by about 5% from year-end 2005. It is important to remember that the timing of when the shares are acquired during the year and when options are exercised affects the weighted average shares outstanding calculation.  For example, the McDonald's shares acquired in the Chipotle exchange offer were still outstanding for more than nine months of calendar year 2006. Therefore, we do not expect a reduction of 5% in diluted weighted average shares for the full-year '06 or the fourth quarter. Much of the activity taking place in 2006 will affect the diluted weighted average share calculation more significantly in 2007. We remain strongly committed to further reducing shares outstanding through share repurchase and disciplined compensation mix practices.  Last year, we implemented changes to our compensation mix that resulted in just 7 million options, and about 1 million restricted stock units being granted in both 2005 and 2006. This is substantially less than the average of 27 million options granted per year from 2000 through 2004.  As a result of reduced grant levels, and abnormally heavy option exercise activity, total options outstanding declined 18% in 2005, and are down another 16% since the beginning of 2006.  The reduced amounts of outstanding options, coupled with a significantly reduced option grant run-rate, are a big part of the reason we are confident that share repurchase activity will yield a meaningful reduction in share count in the years ahead.  Stated more simply -- we will no longer be bucking strong head-winds as we attempt to reduce share count. In closing, we are confident that our focus on being better in all aspects of our business, from delivering great customer experiences to our financial management practices, will drive our business forward and help create even greater value for shareholders and our system.  Thank you, and now I will turn the call back over to Mary Kay. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Matt, I will now open the call up for questions. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman Brothers.\n Jeff Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much. Just a question on the company-operated margins you spoke of earlier, for both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., it seems we are seeing stability in the very high-teens. I am just wondering whether there is something structural that will keep them from reaching 20%-plus? As well, what comps are needed to sustain them at the current levels?  Secondly, on Europe, obviously we have seen very strong margin improvement over the past few quarters. I am just wondering if European margins can reach and maintain a level similar to the U.S.? Or are there obviously some structural differences that would limit achieving those U.S. levels? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: On the U.S. side, there has been a leveling at around that level. Under the type of inflationary times that we have now, we probably need something around 2% comp in the U.S. to maintain the McOpCo margins.  In Europe, that number is more like 3% because of market rents. Rents are not as fixed as they are in the U.S.  Those are the two items that are there. It is really based on our leverage off of comparable sales on our existing restaurants.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: The question I have, if I had to limit to one, is really on the U.S. I wonder if it is fair to say that your growth initiatives, while they remain varied, are really kind of shifting in terms of the emphasis. In the past, it might have been a little bit more in the menu platform lift, menu innovation in big platforms, credit cards, extended hours.  Now it seems like it is a little bit more better advertising, better throughput and a focus on really keeping the number of menu items a little bit more flat. Could you perhaps comment on the sources of growth going forward? Thanks very much. \nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, did you want to respond to that, relative to the U.S. growth and the initiatives?\nRalph Alvarez: Sure, yes. Hi, David. I will tell you that what we are really focused on is that the initiatives that we have add to the base of our business versus just being promotional spikes.  So you are seeing items that do add capacity, that extend our value platform. That is what Chicken Snack Wraps does. It is an item that is a permanent menu item. It incorporates all products that we already have, that allow us to be able to execute it well and it is not a burden on the restaurant.  The convenience items that we have added, of extra hours, 24-hours, cashless and debit cards, all continue to show growth year to year, as people get more used, that we have those and we are open those hours.  Truly, those are the things that we are focused on.  We do have some very innovative menu items we are working on for the long-term, that will also play a part in the next year or two years.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Laurie Hahn from Deutsche Bank.\nLaurie Hahn - Deutsche Bank: I was wondering if you could comment on commodity costs and the outlook for 2007 across your segments, particularly U.S. and Europe?\n Matthew Paull: This is Matt. I will give you a look at '06 and how we see it, and I will ask Mary Kay to jump in on '07.  First, the U.S.: Europe, again for '06: Those are the primary commodity cost drivers, but there are other things that obviously are a factor. There is paper and orange juice and eggs -- all kinds of other commodities, but those are the big three.  I will ask Mary Kay to comment on '07.\n Mary Kay Shaw: For '07, in the U.S., chicken costs are expected to be up slightly, and beef, flat to down slightly.  In Europe, beef and chicken are both expected to be up 2% to 3%.  Thank you, the next question is from John Glass at CIBC.\n John Glass - CIBC: Can you talk a little bit about your unit growth plans as you think about '07 to '09? Maybe if you could comment globally on it, if there is any change to it.  Then, specifically in the U.S., where you have had outstanding results and this may be an opportunity to accelerate growth, what your thoughts are there. \nJames A. Skinner: John, this is Jim. We basically are staying the course on our growth profile over the next few years. We have talked very specifically about growing at that 1.2% or 1.3% or 1.5% rate. We may move more toward the 2% over the next few years, with the focus on China and Russia, Italy -- markets around the world that have demonstrated the opportunity for growth, both in terms of returns and future potential.  Relative to the United States, we may pick up a few units here and there but overall, the growth profile I think is going to stay about the same.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Miller at RBC.\n Larry Miller - RBC: Thanks very much. I had a question on the franchise margin in Europe. I saw the company margins up over 220 basis points, but the franchise margin was not up quite as much. I hope you can give me a little color on that.  I am guessing you are going to talk about the mix in the U.K. being more company-owned, but my question again would be, as a follow-up, why wouldn't you see a similar kind of increase, given that you should get leverage on that increase in franchise same-store sales? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: In Europe, first, we always get a higher leverage on the company restaurants, because our contribution margin on every dollar of sales is higher when we are operating the restaurants than the lower percent of contribution margin that we have off of just the rent and royalties.  For Europe, our 50 basis point growth was driven primarily by Germany and France. The U.K., because we were doing some of the ownership mix changes, some of those restaurants that now become part of the mix on the franchise side may have slightly lower franchise margins, but we still had that growth of 50 basis points in Europe.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. A question on the U.K. I think you mentioned September was the sixth month in a row of positive comps. I was wondering if you could just talk about what is driving the business, why you think you finally gained traction from the many changes you have implemented over the past few years in the U.K.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for the question. We had a leadership change there. Steven Easterbrook now is running the marketplace, and the connection with our customers there and the results around execution in almost every aspect of the business has improved.  Of course, much of this work had been done over the last year-and-a-half or so. Peter Beresford was there. Now, Steven Easterbrook is the continuation of the initiatives that have served us well there.  It is the fundamentals. Better delivery in the restaurants, better delivery around new food news, better delivery in terms of the overall communication with our customers and the brand. All of those things added up have given us the results that we are looking at today.\n Matthew Paull: Joe, you have known me awhile. I do not like to talk about anecdotes, but there is an anecdotal story that reinforces what Jim said about Steve Easterbrook and the style and the approach he has taken to running the U.K. for us, and it is about brand transparency. As you know, there is a movie coming out that talks about our industry. In the past, our approach in the U.K. was to not dignify some of the charges that were leveled against us. But the BBC in the U.K. offered to chair a debate between the guy who authored that movie and Steve Easterbrook. Instead of backing away, when Steve was only about a month into his job, he said \u201cSure, I will go on network television and the BBC and talk to this gentleman about our brand\u201d.  The very fact that we showed up, in our view, made us a winner because it showed that we had nothing to hide and we are willing to be very transparent as a company and a brand. Steve has taken that signal to the Nth degree, and I think it sends a very strong message about how proud we are of our food and our brand, and that is a big part of the reason we are beginning seeing some turn in the U.K.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Our next question is from Andy Barish, Banc of America.\n Andy Barish - Banc of America Securities: A question for Matt on the update of the DLs. Previously, the developmental licensee stores you were talking about actually had operating losses of about $50 million. Now you are talking about an additional 800 stores that in total, now you are looking at operating profits that you are looking at moving aside to licensees.  I guess a little bit of background in terms of what the strategy is there. It would seem you are going to some bigger markets that are actually making money. Why has that sort of shifted a little bit here, as you have been a year into renewing the program?\nMatthew Paull: I agree with your analysis. We have put some markets onto the list that are making money, but we have taken a look at each market and said, what do the risk reward relationships look like, and what is it going to take to realize our potential for the brand in each of these markets?  In many cases, we have room to grow, but we think it is not the best use of our capital, and we think we need to emphasize local relevance more than we have. When those circumstances come together, we think it is an ideal candidate for developmental licensing.  In many of these places, the returns may take a long time to harvest, and some of the competition that we are up against is using somebody else's capital, but most importantly, we want to be able to focus our management teams on the markets that have the greatest opportunity.  Jim wants to comment as well.\nJames A. Skinner: I just want to make a comment. I know we talked a little about this in San Francisco. Our opportunity to grow McDonald's brand presence in these markets around the world, while improving returns, is really where we are headed.  When we looked at these markets and, as Matt mentioned, the risk reward, it has been a successful structure for us. When we put the matrix of this structure to these additional markets, we were able to see where we could grow brand presence, local entrepreneurs, and deliver a better return. That is why it has met the test.\nMatthew Paull: On the return side of this, the math is pretty easy. We would be removing from the denominator of the return computation, over $2 billion in assets. Then, the numerator is going to increase, and the issue is where will the royalty rate be set and how much G&A will it take for us to earn that royalty, and how fast will it grow? But it is clearly going to help our returns by a minimum of 100 basis points once we are completed the project. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Jeff Omohundro from Wachovia.\nJeff Omohundro - Wachovia: Yes, I wonder if you could elaborate a bit more on the higher costs associated with the drive-thru initiative in China. During the recent analysts meeting in Shanghai, this was touched on, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on the opportunities over time to reduce those costs? Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, did you want to talk a little bit about the drive-thru costs there?\nRalph Alvarez: Sure. The higher cost is obviously we are buying property that is freehold versus going in line, and we have slightly higher construction costs that also play a part there. The $200,000 additional cost is really a reasonable amount, relative to what we have there.  We will, as we start building some of these restaurants that we are doing with the deal that we signed with Sinopec, some of those costs may be different. It may be lower because we are sharing property with the gas station. Our experience with that is that we are to lower some of our fixed costs.\nMatthew Paull: Also, we tend to -- when we do something for the first time, we usually do it in a bigger way. As we build more drive-thru\u2019s, they may not all be as big as the ones that we are currently building. These are more flagship right now.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman of Merrill Lynch.\n Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: Could you talk about a little bit earlier in the year, when gas prices were up so much, a lot of the casual diners were talking about their consumers trading down to QSR. Now that the gas prices have come down considerably, are you guys seeing any trade-away, or trade back up to casual? Or do you feel like it was not trade-down owing to gas, it was just better execution on the part of the quick-service operators? Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: I think right at the moment, it is a little too early to tell to see whether there is any trade changes regarding fuel costs.  We are all happy, of course, that the fuel costs are going down. Yet it has not indicated any change relative to our traffic in the restaurants. Earlier, of course, we were able to operate above that noise I think because of our convenience and execution, as you mentioned. We were very pleased with that but certainly, like everybody, pleased at the moment that the prices are going down.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe, J.P. Morgan.\n John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Jim, earlier in your prepared remarks, you talked about the point of sale system in the U.S., I think in 5,000 stores, that led to, at least in tests, 13 more cars an hour. Could you quantify that in terms of comps? Discuss when that might be system-wide, and also talk about some implications outside of the United States, in terms of driving traffic? Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: Ralph might be better to talk about this, John, but the fact is, it is 5,000 around the world. It is not all in the United States. We have a number of these new POS systems in the United States, but we are not ready for prime-time there yet, relative to the execution implementation of that, and able to quantify that really in terms of comparable sales growth, except to say that we all know that serving our customers at the speed of McDonald's and improving the efficiencies in the drive-thru\u2019s will certainly lead to top-line growth and bottom-line growth, but we have not quantified it yet. We are in a migration path today, relative to this new POS system, and yet it will not be worldwide for probably a couple of years yet.  Ralph, did you want to talk about the U.S. migration?\nRalph Alvarez: Sure, and again, this is not hardware. This is mostly software, but the changes are significant, and so we do migrate them into the restaurants, at the same time that we may be doing some of the new food news, or some of the other items, so that the changes can be handled appropriately.  What it does is basically -- the benefit is significantly reduced key strokes, less screens to go through, and that is where the speed comes in, because the conversation with the customer, we do not interrupt the customer with questions as much as we have to under the current system.  It is a capacity enhancer. How much of that translates to sales is too early to tell. Of course, we do not always have capacity constraints, but it truly does not just improve capacity -- obviously, it improves the quality of service.\n Matthew Paull: I agree with everything Ralph said. Building sales is about providing capacity and having demand as well. On the capacity side, you have heard us say for many years that saving 6 seconds off of the drive-thru experience is worth about a point of comp. This has the ability to do that, but again, there is the capacity side of this and the demand side as well.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Next question, Joe Buckley, from Bear Stearns.\n Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thanks. I am going to sneak two in here, because they are both follow-ups.  Matt, would you be willing to comment on the developmental licensing deals, what kind of royalty rates you are getting?  Then secondly, just a little bit more elaboration on the POS system. How many countries is it in? If you would be willing to share with us how many of the 5,000 units are in the U.S., that would be helpful.\nMatthew Paull: A very small number in the U.S. out of the 5,000 -- very small, which is why we are excited about the potential.  On the issue of the DL, I will give you an order of magnitude idea. We have said that this year, we have converted four countries to DLs, and we are working on quite a few more. In general, when we have been able to DL a market, you should think of the royalty as ranging somewhere between 2% and 7%.  If you look at the 35 countries we already have out there, the low is at 2% and the high is probably somewhere 7%, or a tiny bit higher. This is going to be somewhere in the middle of that.  If you have a market that is very challenging in terms of profitability, you have to start at the low end of the range. If you have a more profitable market, you can start more towards the middle. The G&A to earn that royalty ought to be well less than half of the royalty.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. We have a follow-up from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Just a quick follow-up on Europe, and in particular, the UK. Is there any sense that you can give us, any maybe even data points that can give us confidence that this turn-around there, obviously you are getting a lot of momentum now, but if that can continue on a multi-year basis, or at least through '07, anything with regard to customer perceptions or anything, particularly the U.K.? Thank you. \n Matthew Paull: I will throw in a comment. We do not like to predict years ahead of time. We have trouble sometimes quarter to quarter. As you know, we do not even predict comps or earnings, but we like what we see in terms of mystery shop results and brand trust scores.  The trends are improving, and that has to happen for us to sustain what we have. We like the trends, but we are not going to make any promises or commitments.  Jim, do you have any -- \nJames A. Skinner: I would just say that, just like our results in every other part of the world today and by individual country, the focus on our customers in our restaurants, and the diligence that we have around execution and delivering a better experience for our customers, and trying to do a better job today than yesterday, has served us so very well.  It is the same in the U.K. The discipline that team is showing regarding staying the course, delivering around the Plan to Win, showing the great results that Matthew's talked about, and it is sustainable when in fact we stay focused. It is our fly-wheel, if you will, relative to customer relevance is so important for us. \nRalph Alvarez: Just to add to that, Jim and I were there two weeks ago, and spent two days in the restaurants and looking at the U.K. plans. We are pretty familiar with what is going on.  The one thing that we looked at is, are we getting promotional spikes or are we starting to stabilize the baseline? We are stabilizing the baseline. Continued improvement in our operations and our relevance will then move the baseline, and that is really what is the health of future comps. That is why I stated the six months, because six months does not make a long-term trend, but what we see is encouraging.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. It looks like we are out of questions. I will go ahead and turn it back to Jim for a couple of closing remarks.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks again, everybody, for participating in the call. We appreciate your interest in McDonald's, as always.  To sum up everything you heard today, McDonald's business is strong and getting stronger every day. The future holds tremendous opportunity for growth, and under our philosophy of continuous improvement, we will seize that potential by achieving greater relevance to our customers with a robust pipeline of initiatives in each of the five Ps of our Plan to Win.  We will further strengthen our connection with customers by building brand trust. We will leverage our strongest core competency -- simple execution and fast replication, to ensure our top-line initiatives drive our bottom-line. We will optimize our restaurant ownership mix to realize further financial benefits and optimize returns.  Together, these actions will allow us to continue to build system and shareholder value. Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, everyone."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-07-25 16:10:27", "content": "Executives: James A.

Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch \nOperator: Hello and welcome to McDonald's July 25th, 2006 investor conference call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star, one on their touch-tone.  I would not like to turn the conference over to Miss Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Miss Shaw, you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me on our call are CEO Jim Skinner and CFO Matthew Paull. This conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay late today via phone, webcast, and podcast. As always, the forward-looking statements which appear in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both the earnings release and our 8-K, with supplemental financial information, are available on investor.mcdonald's.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.  In addition, in connection with the proposed disposition of our stock in Chipotle through an exchange offer, Chipotle will file with the SEC a registration statement and prospectus that will have important information about the offer. Investors will be able to obtain a free copy of the prospectus and related documents filed with the SEC when available on the SEC's website as well as on our and Chipotle's website, as applicable. Now I will go ahead and turn it over to Jim Skinner.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks, Mary Kay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in McDonald's and certainly your participation in this call.  I am proud to say this quarter was the strongest since we announced our revitalization plans. Our momentum continues around the world, with a comparable sales increase of 5.5% and operating income growth of 12%.  Margin percentages were up around the world for the second consecutive quarter, indicating that more is flowing to our bottom line. Notably, our performance is not being driven by a single country or region but is the result of solid contributions from all of our areas in the world.  The underlying health of our business is strong and we remain focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth. We believe our growth opportunities are enormous and we have created a strong foundation for this growth over the past few years.  Over the last three years, on average, we have grown top-line 6% in constant currencies and delivered double-digit EPS growth. By focusing on being better, not just bigger, we have proven that we can not only capture more of the existing market but also create new opportunities for growth.  The key to success is a simple yet powerful concept. Strategic focus and balance across the five P\u2019s of our Plan to Win. Whether in the area of people, products, place, price or promotion, we strive for the right balance between innovation and disciplined execution.  Currently, we are focused on three critical strategies to drive performance. First, striking an effective balance between consistent promotion of our core product offerings with the successful introduction of new food menus. No matter how familiar our core menu is to customers, we know that featuring these products in our restaurants and marketing them drives sales and guest counts. During the recent World Cup, for example, Germany, France, China and Taiwan were successful with promotions linked to the Big Mac and extra value meals.  On the new food side, we continue to introduce products that are relevant to customers' tastes and lifestyles. The U.S. is strengthening its position in chicken with the launch of the Chicken Snack Wrap, a premium chicken strip inside a heated tortilla with lettuce, cheese, and ranch sauce.  We are also broadening drink offerings, a process that began with our coffee upgrade and continues with testing of grab-and-go drinks in resealable containers, such as fruit juices and flavored waters. Around the world, we have been adding new choices to our Happy Meals, from milk and drinkable yogurt to fruit bags and carrot sticks. Australia is taking this to the next level in August with the of Pasta Zoo, a kid's Happy Meal entr\u00e9e that has strong nutritional profiles. The product has already received positive reaction from Australia's food and nutrition community and we are confident that moms and kids will feel the same.  Longer term, we are supporting food innovation with the European Food Studio in Paris and now its counterpart, the Food Studio and Quality Assurance Center in Hong Kong, which got up in operation in June. The second strategic focus involves the relationship between everyday value offerings and appealing mix of premium products. Success here has played a key role in driving results around the world, most recently in Europe. Pasta-conscious Europeans can rely on value platforms such as the Pound Saver Menu in the U.K. and Einmal Eins in Germany. These everyday menus are complemented by premium sandwiches such as the Big Tasty in Germany and the Chicken Mythic in France. Longer term, markets such as Japan are working to optimize pricing on the core menu, while in China, we are exploring menu pricing that is tiered by both market and restaurant to help address the vast differences in purchasing power across that country. A third opportunity involves maintaining a relevant dining experience while expanding our convenience through drive-thru\u2019s, extended hours and, in some parts of the world, delivery.  Re-imaging increases the relevance of our restaurants and positively impacts customers perceptions. By the end of 2006, we will have a re-imaged or rebuilt over 8,000 restaurants over a four-year period, representing 30% of our traditional restaurant base. In the U.S., this translates to more than 5,000 of our 13,700 restaurants re-imaged and rebuilt by the end of the year.  Leveraging our convenience advantage also remains a significant area of growth opportunity. Extending our hours of operation continues to drive results in the U.S., where more than 90% of the restaurants participate in some way. We are expanding this opportunity as appropriate in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In China, our development strategy is focused on opening more restaurants with drive-thru\u2019s to capitalize on the increasingly mobile population there. This strategy received a significant boost in June with the signing of a strategic partnership with Sinopec, China's largest petroleum retailer.  The agreement gives McDonald's first right of refusal of co-developed drive-thru restaurants at existing and new Sinopec outlets, which number more than 30,000. It is great having a choice and our initial plan, of course, is to identify and prioritize the best locations across China. Balance is important, not only in our restaurant activity but also in the broader management of our system. As we mentioned in previous calls, we have been working to find the right balance between company and local ownership in our system.  As previously announced, we plan to convert 15 to 20 markets to a developmental license, or DL, arrangement. In a DL structure, the local entrepreneur uses his or her capital, real estate and local knowledge to build the brand and optimize results. McDonald's collects a royalty but invests no capital, unlike with traditional franchise agreement.  So far this year, we have completed DL conversions for three countries -- Nicaragua, Honduras, and Bulgaria, and we will soon convert another market in Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa. Similarly, the United Kingdom is working to shift the balance of its restaurant ownership so that more restaurants are in the hands of franchisees. This can be accomplished through converting company-owned restaurants to franchises, or through joint ventures in which the company and a partner share a stake in the restaurants.  Year-to-date, 24 company-owned restaurants have been franchised and three joint venture partners have been formed, representing 40 stores. In addition, we plan to franchise or JV another 50 U.K. stores later this year. We at McDonald's are energized by both the success we are achieving today and the great opportunity for growth that lies ahead. We recognize, however, that we have things to do to realize our potential.  We must continue to push the boundaries placed on our brand, earning our customers' permission to try more new things under the Golden Arches. Our operating systems, both at the counter and the kitchen, must keep pace with the demands of our customers and our business.  We have incredible variety in our restaurants around the world -- different menus, floor plans, operating hours and traffic patterns. We have learned that one size does not fit all, so we are working on a next-generation operating system that you have talked with us about before, that will have flexible components that can be plugged in depending on the restaurant's needs. We are calling it the flexible operating platform. While the flexible operating platform is under development, we are implementing the bridge operating platform in countries that need help with their operations now. The bridge operating platform is a customized solution that combines elements from our made-for-you and traditional grill direct systems in ways that are best suited to the needs of a particular restaurant. As the name suggests, it acts as a bridge to the flexible operating system of the future. To me, our most important challenge is to maintain and build trust of our customers. We must do this, and we are. We are driving efforts around the world to tell the facts about the quality of our food, our great employment opportunities and our corporate values.  We are working directly with moms, the gatekeepers of the family's trust, through our newly formed global mom's panel.  We are connecting with customers on their terms, whether it is through internet blogs, text-messaging, or conventional advertising. To close, I want to emphasize how confident I am in the future of McDonald's. There is great opportunity ahead and we are committed to capturing it for the benefit of our customers, our system, and our shareholders.  Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Matthew Paull, our CFO.\nMatthew Paull: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.  New products, convenient service and hours, clean, comfortable restaurants, and marketing linked to popular properties and events have combined to make the McDonald's experience even more relevant. The connection we have built with our customers, along with our commitment to discipline in operations and in financial management, continues to deliver solid results.  As Jim just highlighted, sales growth was strong in every area of the world, driving total brand McDonald's margin dollars up 12% to a record $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Breaking this down, McDonald's franchise margins, which represent about two-thirds of total margin dollars, were $1.1 billion and, as a percent of revenues, rose 80 basis points with every area of the world showing improvement.  McDonald's company-operated margin dollars grew 20% to nearly $620 million in the second quarter. Company-operated margins increased 130 basis points as every segment showed improvement for the second consecutive quarter.  I will highlight the drivers behind this margin growth in the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. In the United States, company-operated margins improved 60 basis points to 19.8%, the highest in more than 10 years. The increase was driven by strong sales partly offset by higher labor, utility and promotional expenses.  In the second quarter, we enjoyed a benign cost environment for beef, chicken, and cheese. For the year in the United States, we expect beef and chicken costs to be relatively flat and cheese to be down. In Europe, company-operated margins increased an impressive 170 basis points to 16%. More than half of the increase was driven by strong comparable sales growth in the United Kingdom and Germany. Compared with last year, commodity costs for beef and chicken were down in Europe, while cheese was flat. Our outlook for the full year is for all three to be basically flat.  Importantly, our initiatives to improve performance in the U.K. are beginning to gain traction. We have been working very hard to enhance our brand image by emphasizing the quality of our food and the opportunities a McDonald's job provides. Also, we are aggressively showing the facts about McDonald's in interviews and internet blogs. In the second quarter, we promoted flagship core menu sandwiches like the Quarter Pounder and Big Mac, and marketed our brand with an innovative text message to win World Cup tickets game. We are optimistic that the U.K.'s re-franchising strategy, which contributed slightly to the quarter's progress, will help company-operated margins going forward.  We are encouraged with the U.K.'s progress but there is much more we can and will do. We are confident our plans and the focus of our U.K. team will deliver results. Asia-Pacific generated a 170-basis point increase in company-operated margins, primarily driven by Australia's ongoing strong performance and improved results in China and Hong Kong. The strategic menu price adjustments that Jim mentioned contributed to China's improvement.  Designed to deliver value to customers while encouraging trade-up, margins are beginning to benefit from extra value meals becoming a larger portion of our sales mix in China. In addition, supply chain and operating efficiencies helped lower costs. Turning to G&A, as expected, G&A in the second quarter increased at a faster rate than sales and revenues. This was due to an increased accrual for incentive-based compensation and our very successful biannual owner-operator convention, which was held in May. We expect the rate of G&A spending to slow in the second-half of the year and, as a percent of revenues, to end the year below 2005 levels.  Consolidated operating income for the quarter was more than $1.1 billion, up a healthy 12%, primarily due to the strong margin improvements we delivered.  This brings us to quarterly earnings per share. Last year's second-quarter EPS was $0.42, including $0.09 of incremental tax expense resulting from our decision to bring home earnings under the Homeland Investment Act.  Second-quarter '06 earnings per share is $0.67. This includes a non-operating gain of $0.10 from the sale of a portion of our Chipotle stock; $0.01of impairment, primarily related to the anticipated sale of a market in Asia-Pacific to a developmental licensee; and $0.01 of incremental tax expense from a tax law change in Canada. Turning briefly to Chipotle, subject to market conditions, we are moving forward with plans to completely separate from Chipotle to a tax-free exchange. This will allow us to buy back McDonald's shares using highly appreciated Chipotle stock with no tax on the appreciation. As we previously indicated, the proceeds from the secondary sale of Chipotle stock, which we completed in May, will also be used to buy back stock. All of this is on top of at least $5 billion to $6 billion we expect to return to shareholders in 2006 and 2007 combined. In the second quarter, we bought back $800 million of stock, bringing year-to-date total share repurchase to $1.8 billion, or 53 million shares. You should be aware however that until we complete our separation from Chipotle, we cannot be in the market buying back our stock. When the exchange transaction is completed in the fourth quarter, we expect to be repurchasing stock again.  Rest assured, we understand and share your focus on reducing our share count. It was part of the reason behind the compensation mix changes made last year that resulted in fewer options being granted.  In fact, as a result of exercises and reduced grant levels, total options outstanding at year-end 2005 were more than 30% lower than in 2002. We are absolutely committed to reducing our share count and fully expect the count to continue to head in the right direction. The count has declined by about 25 million diluted shares since year-end '05 and should continue to add to our EPS growth rate. I would like to update you on a few other guidance items.  Based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to have a slightly positive impact for the remainder of the year and a minimal impact for the full year.  Because of our actions under the Homeland Investment Act, our debt and cash levels are higher than they otherwise would have been. Due to this higher debt level, current interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, we now expect interest expense to be up 11% to 13% for the year. However, offsetting this is higher projected interest income. Since implementing our Plan to Win in 2003, we have delivered the most consistent and solid operating performance in McDonald's history. Significantly, in the second quarter, every area of the world contributed to our performance, demonstrating the Plan to Win's adaptability and applicability to the unique local environment in which we operate our restaurants.  I am confident that as we further evolve our Plan to Win and strengthen our connection with customers, we will build on this track record of strong, consistent results. Thank you. Now I will turn the call back over to Mary Kay Shaw.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Matt. I will now open the call up for questions. (Operator Instructions) To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We will come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows.  The first question is from John Glass at CIBC.\nJohn Glass - CIBC World Markets: Thank you. I actually wanted to follow up on the Sinopec agreement with a couple of details. Who operates the restaurants? Who puts in the capital? Most importantly, 30,000 locations is a significant number, but what would be a good near intermediate-term expectation for development under that agreement? How many of your units in china, for example, maybe on a percentage basis would be in those type of locations?\nJames A. Skinner: The details of the arrangement, it is a 20-year agreement and we have the first right of refusal, as I mentioned. The arrangement relative to capital invested, et cetera, the details are not public at the moment. It is a matter of working that on a deal-by-deal basis.  In terms of numbers, they do have 30,000 locations, but that is the beauty of having the first right of refusal. We would never have an agreement with a company like this where we had to do all 30,000, and you can imagine why.  As a retailer and the biggest petroleum company in the country, I am sure they have terrific sites among those 30,000, but they probably also have some that may not be as good. It is very important for us to get off to a good start with them in the selection of the original sites. We are pretty good at this, and I think we will do a careful job and we will get off to a good start. But we cannot really predict what the total number would be and I do not think we have looked at it that way. We just know there is a huge opportunity there. \nMatthew Paull: John, we will operate the restaurants in all situations. It is possible that in some cases, Sinopec would be our landlord, but in a lot of other cases they will not be. We are still working that out, as Jim said.  We want to emphasize that we have said that one of our issues in the past in China was we did not get off to the best start in terms of site selection. We love this deal for all the reasons that Jim mentioned, especially the fact that it has, from our point of view, tremendous option value. There is no minimum or maximum number of restaurants we have to build. If things look good to us, we will build more. There is no cost to us and in terms of option value, the option value is unlimited to us because we have a choice.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from David Palmer at UBS. \nDavid Palmer - UBS: Congratulations on the quarter. I have a question on the bridge operating platform. This is something that could greatly improve your menu innovation flexibility in Europe. How will you roll that out? Could you give us a timetable on that? When you might be done a certain market? I would imagine you are going to be doing company and franchise at similar timetables, but could you give us an idea of when you might be able to be switched on with the new platforms, with the idea that we might see a better innovation pipeline come on-stream at that point, that would catch up to the new platform? Thank you. \nJames A. Skinner: Well, the bridge operating platform will simplify our operations, and that combination of Made For You and grill direct that we talked about, which does enhance the work environment for the crew, and it also gives us the opportunity, as you said, to deliver a variety of experiences for our customers around food.  It is currently being tested in a couple hundred restaurants in the U.K., France and Germany. Also in Italy, Spain, Sweden, Russia and Hungary. Over the next year or so, we will probably convert around 1500 restaurants. It is important to know though that it is a bridge operating platform and the end state vision for the long term is for us to be able to have the flexible operating platform. That would be step two, although this is not something that we will be doing in every market, but right now it looks like around 1500 restaurants. Obviously that is company restaurants and franchise restaurants as well.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Glen Petraglia at Citigroup.\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup : Good morning. If you could perhaps comment on the U.S. and some of the trends you are seeing, from whether it be a traffic or an average check perspective. I am wondering if you are seeing any signs that consumers are being a little bit more cautious with how they spend their dollars, i.e., are you seeing increases in Dollar Menu purchases, et cetera?\nJames A. Skinner: We continue to benefit from the combination of initiatives in the United States. As you know, the big factors in this quarter, as we talked about, were breakfast, driven by coffee, and then certainly the premium chicken salad, the Asian Salad, the Happy Meals, and the extended hours -- all of those things contributing positively.  I am happy to say that the demand for the Dollar Menu continues to support the base of our business. We are not seeing a shift in consumer buying habits around the Dollar Menu, which is very important.  Obviously we have been able to operate above the noise for now, relative to fuel costs, which has been something that we are very, very pleased with.  It is possible that traffic could start to fall off. We do not know but thus far, we have been very fortunate regarding that and the trends are very positive for us.\nMatthew Paull: On the issue of guest counts, year to date in the U.S., about 40% of the comp is from guest count increases.\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup : Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoseph Buckley - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the U.K. It sounds like your plans to re-franchise or do joint ventures is moving a little bit faster than you first thought. I am curious if the joint venture aspect is something new, and if you can describe in a little bit more detail what kind of potential that might have.\nJames A. Skinner: The first part is regarding the franchising. We are re-franchising about 125 McOpCo\u2019s and developing franchising plans as we move to 2007, 2008. We are about halfway through what we had planned to do this year, as I mentioned in my comments.  We could argue that maybe we are a little bit ahead of schedule, but I think in the end, we are right about where we wanted to be, and we will transition about 125 of those restaurants throughout \u201906.  I did not get the second question. \nMatthew Paull: The joint venture way of operating is something we are very used to. We use it heavily in France. We use it in the U.S.  I would like to point out this: we set our goal at a minimum is to get to less than 50% of the restaurants being company-owned in the U.K. over time. When we started, we were at 63%. Right now, year-to-date we are at 58%. We are making good progress. We are going to take it below 50%, but we did not predict exactly how long that would take. Thank you. \nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC: Thank you. This is a question on marketing. You talked about evolving the \u201ci'm lovin\u2019 it\u201d campaign. I just had a question -- is it still as effective today as when you first rolled it out? Is that still the plan, to evolve the marketing? Can you give us any previews of what direction that might take, if you have any? Thank you. \nJames A. Skinner: We have talked a lot about this, Larry, and that being that we are looking at \u201ci'm lovin\u2019 it\u201d next generation. It continues to be relevant with our consumers in the marketplace, and of course, the messaging and the communication in the framework of \u201ci'm lovin\u2019 it\u201d around the world varies.  We are working very hard right now to work on the next generation of \u201ci'm lovin\u2019 it\u201d, focusing on the it -- that being the food and the moments and the feelings that are so important to our customers and their relationship with McDonald's.  We are tying in with World Cup and Olympic Alliance and our popular global events like the World Cup and McDonald's has unparalleled ability in this arena. That is sort of the way we are working on it.  We expect that we will be able to move along positively in this regard.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman Brothers.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Thanks very much, just a question on the strong European margins.  I am wondering if you could dissect the reported company-operated margin number into the three major markets for the quarter this year versus last, just so we could see the trends in each. What would be the overall European margin similar to quarter's past if you exclude the U.K., which I believe you said was a positive contributor? I am still guessing it was the low man on the pole. Lastly, what your outlook is for company-operated European margins for the back-half of the year?\nMatthew Paull: We do not make predictions on margins -- sorry about that.  I will be able to address your other questions. The U.K. was a significant contributor to the overall improvement in Europe through comps, through store mix and through more favorable commodity costs in the U.K. After the U.K., Germany was a big contributor and that was about comps offset by higher labor costs.  Beef costs and chicken costs in Europe were down about 4% each in the second quarter. I would say we like where we are headed with Europe. We like that the improvement is coming from the U.K. and Germany. France continues strong, but it did not improve significantly compared to the other two countries, and I do not really have the math in front of what we would have looked like without the U.K., so we will have somebody in investor relations get back to you on that one. \nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning. I had a quick question on the U.K. business when we think about brand image and the sustainability of what seems to be improving trends there.  Math, I know you mentioned that it seems as though you are getting traction from messaging, but if I think about a year or two ago, there was a lot of talk about school lunch programs, nutritional content, childhood obesity. It seemed to be very front and center in the media. Can you just talk about the current environment there, whether those types of media stories have died down a bit? Maybe you can share with us a little bit on consumer feedback more recently in the U.K. market. Thank you. \nJames A. Skinner: I will start, and then Matt can follow up with whatever comments he wants to make.  I think the environment there has changed, but it has changed because of the job we are doing regarding the communication around our food. As you know, the U.K. is an environment in which the intensity of tabloid nature communication probably does not change much over time. The issues change from time to time, but the fact is the issues around obesity, the issues around lunch programs, the issue around the quality of food and the issue around choice continues to be there.  I think the reason we are improving, and we like the trends right now, including consumer feedback, which we were fortunate over the last few months to have very good mystery shop scores, and Plan to Win scores around the attributes and the consumer perception in the U.K. was leading the pack. We are very proud of that and we think we have done a good job there.  Relative to the environment, the environment really does not change that much. It is a matter of how we respond to it and how we manage our affairs, which I think we have done a very good job with. \nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Mark Wiltamuth at Morgan Stanley.\nMark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter: I wanted to explore the European margin power. Clearly you had a big turnaround here in the margins this quarter. Could that 16% margin turn into an 18% or 19% number over time? Where do you think the big margin opportunities lie? Are they really in closing underperformers or re-franchising, or is it just improving the average restaurant sales? \nMatthew Paull: We have been very careful over the last three years to say that we have a global margin goal, which is to get back to year 2000 company-operated margin levels, which were 16.9% for the full year, but we are not going to break it out by country or area of the world.  When we look at where the biggest opportunity lies, it still lies in the U.K. Even though we saw improvement, there is a long way to go.  Part of it is about growing sales through extended hours and offering breakfast more aggressively. Part of it is through the re-franchising that we have begun. We still have a long way to go.  We are not going to pick a specific goal, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeffrey Omohundro.\nJeffrey Omohundro - Wachovia Securities: I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on the new product front, in particular the chicken snack wrap test, how that has proceeded and how are the consumers using the product? Is it being used as an add-on, for example? \nMatthew Paull: The national launch will run from August 1st through September 4th. The suggested price point will be about $1.29.  We love the product for a whole variety of reasons, one of which you hinted at, which is how people are going to use it. It is sometimes an add-on, it is sometimes a snack.  We also think it gives us a really wonderful opportunity to make an existing product better. It is the same chicken select that is used in our Chicken Select offering, and that product, which is one of my favorite products, is even better if we have enough volume to keep it really fresh. By using the snack wrap, based on the same core product, we can do bigger volumes, keep it fresher, and we think our customers will like it, our operators will like it and our profitability will show.  Lastly, the food and paper percentage on that product at $1.29 price point is very attractive. It is well below double cheeseburger, well below salads, it is below our other chicken sandwiches.  From every way we look at this, it looks like something that will make a lot of sense for us.\nJames A. Skinner: It did very well in the test markets. We would expect that it will be a hit with our customers. Have you had it yet, Jeff?\nJeffrey Omohundro - Wachovia Securities: Yes. \nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe at JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: I actually have some questions on the re-imaging of the restaurants themselves. If I am right, I think the rate of re-imaging in the U.S. will slow at the end of 2006. Is that still right?\nMatthew Paull: The original plan that we announced was a three-year plan that was scheduled to mature at the end of '06, you are right about that.  But we have learned some things through this plan, which is that we cannot ever afford to let the brand grow old and tired. So there is the possibility that when we look at the chance to do something with the exteriors of our restaurants, we will decide to use a similar kind of program to re-image the exteriors.  We are talking with operator leadership about it. We have not made any decisions yet, but you are right -- the original program expires at the end of '06, but if we see something that excites us, we are certainly willing to co-invest with our franchisees to send the message that the brand is getting even more contemporary.  If you take a look at the restaurants that we have externally re-imaged in Columbus and Tulsa, you will see how exciting it looks for a very, very small investment. \nJames A. Skinner: But the pace that we are on for '06, you had said we would slow down in '06. The original understanding comes to an end in '06, John, but we are at about the same pace we were in '04 and '05 regarding '06 in the year.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just as a follow-up to that, would you guys mind recapping your $1.8 billion in cap-ex, and maybe giving us an update on re-imaging overseas, or how that cap-ex will be spent? Thank you.\nMatthew Paull: The rough breakdown is a bit over $900 million is being reinvested in existing stores. Some of that is maintenance cap-ex but the vast majority of it is re-imaging of various types in various parts of the world. Probably a little over $650 million is to build new restaurants, about 800 gross new restaurants, and that is up a little bit from prior years.  Mary Kay, do you recall the latter part of the question?\nMary Kay Shaw: Just the total outside of the U.S. For example, about 30% of the total cap-ex will be Europe, 13% Asia, 5% Canada, 4% Latin and the 44% U.S., but that is total, so that is new reinvestment and other.  The next question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: This kind of builds on some of the other questions, just the broader question of cash usage heading into '07 and beyond, thinking about some of the major buckets, such as cap-ex, share repurchase, debt pay-down, dividend -- how might these change?  For instance, I can see that maybe net debt reduction might slow in '07 and beyond. We have had some increasing clarity on the tax treatment of dividends, and there might even be a shift in the cap-ex needs. Could you perhaps go into some of these? Thank you. \nJames A. Skinner: David, we followed with great interest what happened with the tax law. We are very happy that it was extended through 2010. That is one of many factors in what we do with our cash.  I will review what we have always said, and some of this has not changed. Our first priority has always been and will continue to be to invest in high-return projects inside brand McDonald's. Obviously, when we separate from Chipotle, that frees up a little bit more capital than we had.  Then we like to look at share repurchase and dividends. We like dividends. You will remember three years ago when we began dramatically increasing the dividend, we said it is very consistent with where we want to take the company. If we are going to be better, not bigger, we can afford to be paying a higher dividend as a way of reminding people of how strong and steady our cash flow generation is.  We do, however, like to reserve a little flexibility, which is why we have not been specific about how much of the cash that goes back to shareholders will be in the form of dividend versus share repurchase. Frankly, it is a function of where our stock is trading and how the other things look to us. So we want to, to the extent possible, reserve flexibility.  We have signaled at least $5 billion to $6 billion will be returned to shareholders in '06 and '07, but we do not want to be specific on how much takes the form of dividend versus share repurchase, and we do not want to be specific of how much in '06 versus '07.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Now, I will get back to Jeff Bernstein's earlier question. I think U.K. contributed about 40 basis points to the improvement in the Europe margins for the quarter.  It looks like we are out of questions, so I will go ahead and turn it over to Jim for some closing remarks.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks again for your participation and in closing, I want to reinforce our commitment to providing value for our customers, the McDonald's system and our shareholders. We are proud of the success we are achieving today and excited about the opportunity for growth in the future.  Our Plan to Win remains our framework for success and we will continue achieving the right balance of innovation and disciplined execution, and will generate growth around the world.  In the end, I am confident that our strong performance will continue. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference.

With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it over to Mike Roberts.\nMichael Roberts, President, Chief Operating Officer, Director: Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning and welcome. I\u2019d like to being by saying that I\u2019m very pleased with our progress in Q1. YTD global comp sales were up 5.2% with more than half of that comp attributed to increased guest counts. Additionally, margins improved across all geographic segments of the business, the first time this has occurred on the company margin in two years. That said, we know the opportunities in front of us and we\u2019re intent on building on our momentum. This momentum continues because our plan to win is working and because our system is more aligned than ever before, our operators, employees and suppliers. This alignment will continue at our upcoming worldwide convention where our entire system to come together to talk about how we can create even more success in our future. In the United States, YTD comps sales are up 6.6%. Results are being driven by new food news, like spicy chicken, premium coffee; conveniences like extended hours, Arch Cards , Cashless. Our ongoing reimaging work, which continues to create a more relaxing, relevant and modern experience for our customers and of course Monday we launched the Asian salad. We\u2019re also laying a solid foundation for the future with the continued development of a food pipeline, which includes the exploration of even more chicken options, additional beverage choices like juices and flavored water and more breakfast variety, like a Big Burrito. Breakfast continues to be a big driver for us, and our improved coffee is adding to the momentum of our breakfast strategy. Additionally, we\u2019re adding more fun, excitement and buzz to our restaurants, through promotions that touch our customers passions, including our Pirates of the Caribbean online game and a fitness CD that comes with the purchase of our new salad. Also, this quarter, Canada is building momentum in sales and margins, with comps up 8.5%. With the leadership of Ralph Alvarez and Louie Mele, the Canadians have placed a greater emphasis on quality, service and cleanliness, the promotion of our core food and an overall review of the ownership mix of our restaurants. In Europe, YTD comp sales are up 2%, which is progress given the fact that the QSR market there is down. That said, we\u2019re intent on enhancing our customers\u2019 experience by improving QSC, by strengthening lines with more chicken and premium beef sandwiches, by continuing our leading-edge reimaging work through new d\u00e9cor, enhanced lighting, decreased kitchen noise and music by (date party?) and by solidifying our pricing strategy with a combination of everyday low price, core products and premium products. Now a little more detail on our big three markets in Europe. First, momentum continues in France, with some of the highest margins in the world. Results are being driven by a combination of Le Petit Plaisir, their value menu, premium burgers like the Big Tasty, and chicken products like their Mythic Sandwich and through ongoing reimaging that enhances both the inside and the exterior of the restaurant. Additionally, France remains our best practice as it relates to telling our story. Jean-Pierre Petit, CEO of McDonalds France, holds live internet chats with our customers and with our crew. He conducts open doors so our customers can see how our food is prepared and served and he dedicates a significant amount of his advertising spend to print ads on quality, opportunity and our charity. The good news is this model is now spreading to other parts of the world. Related to Germany, Einmal Eins, their value menu, continues to drive results and shows that the power of a value menu and the power that that can have when balanced with premium burgers and chicken. Additionally, our team continues to respond to customers taste buds with ethnic flavors in sandwiches like Chicken Cordon Bleu and the TexMex Burger. In the UK, while we continue to face challenges, this is a very profitable market. In 2005, our operating income was well over $200 million, representing almost 6% of McDonalds\u2019 total operating income. There, we\u2019re focused on premium burgers like the Quarter Pounder Deluxe, increasing relevance by reimaging an additional 100 restaurants this year, enhancing the Pound Saver menu and offering relevant promotions, like the World Cup Ticket competition that customers play via their cell phones, beginning next week. As we previously announced, we are reviewing our ownership structure in the UK. We closed 25 high street restaurants where the lease costs were so high it not longer made sense to operate there. In addition, we\u2019ve already refranchised 25 restaurants and planned to refranchise another 25-35 between now and the end of the year. The owner-operators there are very excited about this opportunity to own more restaurants. Looking at Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, YTD comp sales are up 4.1% and momentum continues in this part of the world. I was just there, in fact, and saw some of the great progress we\u2019re making first-hand. We\u2019re connecting with customers there by continuing to improve our quality, service and cleanliness with the most improvement in the area of friendliness and accuracy. By offering new food news, including the expansion of the successful Rice Burger from Taiwan to other markets including Singapore, Hong Kong and testing in China. Espresso coffees in Australia and additional kid\u2019s choice like corn in china and breakfast like the thick toast in Australia. And by delivering innovative promotions. This year, Hong Kong continued their momentum, with Jack the Dipper, a character they\u2019ve created to build buzz around our McNuggets. China continues to represent enormous opportunity for McDonalds, with comps up YTD. We\u2019re growing the business there through food relevance, with the chicken burger and the spicy chicken filet. Drive Thru expansion, compelling everyday value and telling the story of the quality of our food, where we\u2019re running quality print ads in the recently launched askme.com, a public information website dedicated to food safety and the quality education of all of our guests. Finally, in Latin America, YTD comp sales are up 15.3%, driven by a comprehensive quality service improvement plan, the launch of the Big Tasty and continued focus on everyday affordability. Related to marketing, Mary Dillon is making significant progress on improving the relevance with the next generation of i\u2019m lovin\u2019 it, on media innovation \u2013 which includes looking at different ways we reach our customers \u2013 and on building relationships with moms, including innovating around the future Happy Meal. While we\u2019re focused on driving results today, we also have our eyes firmly fixed on the future as we continue building even deeper relationships with our customers and greater alignment with our operators, suppliers and employees.  Thank you all, and now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Matt Paull, our CFO.\n Matthew Paull, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Senior Executive Vice President: Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning everyone. At McDonalds, our business strength is tied to brand strength, making our brand and the restaurant experience more relevant to our customers is essential to building the business, and we believe we are doing just that. We had a solid first quarter, reinforcing that our strategy of growing by improving our existing restaurant and focusing on the five Ps continues to be the right strategy for McDonalds. The global comp sales numbers we delivered this quarter contributed to improved margin percentages across all segments, both franchise and company-operated margins were up 100bps and 70bps respectively. Franchise margin dollars neared $1 billion in Q1, making up almost two-thirds of worldwide margin dollars. McDonalds company-operated margin dollars increased $53 million over Q1 2005. In the United States, company-operated margins as a percent of sales increased 40bps to a strong 18.3%, driven by positive comparable sales. We had some help in Q1 from relatively flat commodity costs, partly offset by higher utilities, labor costs and increased promotion costs, specifically relating to our launches of coffee and spicy chicken. For the year, we expect costs for beef and chicken to be relatively flat and cheese to be down. Overall, utilities are anticipated to increase for the year and labor costs will be up slightly due to a higher average hourly rate.  Returning now to Europe, company-operated margins were up 10bps in Q1. Strong sales in France and Russia and improved performance in Germany helped offset performance in the UK and labor pressures throughout Europe. Labor pressures are expected to continue. Beef costs were relatively flat in Q1 and are expected to be flat for the year. France, Germany and Russia all delivered company-operated margins, however Europe\u2019s company-operated margin was reduced by about 70bps due to UK results. Mike just highlighted our initiatives to improve performance in the UK and we are confident we will get there over time.  Moving now to Asia Pacific, this segment generated a 140bp improvement in company-operated margins. This was driven by strong results in Australia and improved results in Hong Kong and China. Australia continues to drive transactions with locally-relevant menu options like Espresso Pronto Coffee and a range of seven deli-choice sandwiches. Regarding China, I was just in China three weeks ago and was very excited about what I saw. We are offering customers locally-relevant menu options like the ones you heard Mike describe, and we\u2019re also excited about the current test of products like the rice burger, which features spicy chicken or beef, with red cabbage and lettuce on toasted sticky rice instead of a bun. We are becoming a more convenient option for our Chinese customers, through better site selection and Drive Thru expansion. Adding Drive Thrus the way we at McDonalds do Drive Thrus has brought a unique convenience to the market. Although building a restaurant in China with a Drive Thru costs 30-50% more, or about $200,000 more, we are achieving 50-80% higher sales volumes, clearly a very good investment. In 2004 alone, there were 2 million more cars on the road in China than in the prior year. Both car ownership and traffic are growing in China at explosive rates, with plans to add many more Drive Thrus in the next few years, we are poised to capture the opportunity.  G&A for the quarter increased at a rate which is much higher than the rate we project for the full year. Some of this is due to the timing of certain expenses like the Olympics. In Q2, we expect G&A to increase mostly due to the timing of our biannual operator convention. For the year, we continue to expect G&A to decline as a percent of revenues and system wide sales. Now I\u2019d like to discuss quarterly EPS. Q1 2005 EPS was $0.56 including a $0.13 benefit from a favorable tax settlement. Q1 2006 EPS was $0.49 including several items that on a net basis cost us about a penny in EPS. The charges in the quarter total $86 million on a pretax basis, or about $0.045 per share. They include $42 million, or about $0.02 per share related to our previously announced review of restaurant locations in the UK resulting in the closing of 25 high street restaurants. $29 million, or about a penny and a half per share related to the buyout of certain franchises in Brazil. $8 million, or less than $0.005 per share related to the sale of a small market in Europe to a developmental licensee, and $7.5 million or less than $0.005 per share from asset right-offs in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa.  On a constant currency basis, without these items, operating income was up 14%. On the income side, we reported a non-operating gain of $0.035 per share from the IPO of Chipotle and the concurrent sale of a portion of our Chipotle shares. In our January call, we described our developmental licensing, or DL strategy, which we planned to implement over a three-year period in some 15-20 countries representing about 1,500 restaurants. Remember, DLs as we call them, has been a successful part of our international strategy for 15+ years, and we already use a DL structure in 32 countries. In 2005 alone, two countries representing 325 restaurants were moved into a DL structure. In a DL ownership structure, the local entrepreneur uses his or her capital, real estate and local knowledge to build the brand and optimize results. In a DL, unlike with a conventional franchise, McDonalds collects only a royalty, investing no capital. We are making progress on this strategy, in Q1 we signed a letter of intent to DL one of our smaller markets in Europe. As previously mentioned, we recorded a small impairment loss to developmentally license this market. As we have said, our goal with the DL strategy is to optimize sales and profitability in the long run, not necessarily to maximize proceeds in the short run.  The strategy puts restaurants in certain overseas markets in the hands of local entrepreneurs, who can keep them locally relevant and growing without the use of our capital. We are making progress in other countries as well, but it will take time to find the right candidates and to negotiate and finalize arrangements. Though we are aggressively pursuing this strategy, accounting rules on impairment do not allow us to record possible future losses on asset sales until we conclude we are both likely to complete a sale within 12 months and have a reasonable idea of the final sales price. With the signing of the letter of intent for the small market in Europe, we crossed the accounting threshold for that DL market in Q1.  In closing, the year is off to a good start. As always, you can expect this team to take absolutely nothing for granted. We will continue to work our plan to win for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the McDonalds\u2019 system. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mary Kay. \nQuestions and Answers:\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Matt. I will now open the call up for questions. Please press *1 if you have a question, and *2 to remove yourself from the queue. To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll come back to you for follow-ups as time allows. Our first question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nQ \u2013 David Palmer, UBS Warburg: Hi. Matt, and Mike, congratulations on the quarter. I wanted just to ask kind of a theoretical question. I was thinking, it seems to me you have four options with every restaurant these days. You can operate them, you can franchise them, you can license them and of course you can just simply not own them. You can just sell it. I was wondering if you could give us some insights into your decision process about these options, in particular I was wondering about hurdle rates and when you think about the returns for a restaurant, you may be considering for ownership or perhaps even refranchising or licensing, do you consider regional overhead and even a market-rate return for the real estate in assessing the earnings of the restaurant? I realize you\u2019re a global company, if you want to use an example that would be fine too. Thanks very much.\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: David, I\u2019ll take the first crack at it, then Mike will probably want to comment. First of all, when we\u2019re deciding how to own and operate restaurants, staying locally relevant is very important. But I want you to know that we have different hurdle rates for different parts of the world, which are a function of risk. We look at borrowing costs in different countries, we look at the environment we\u2019d be operating in \u2013 what kind of legal system is there, are property rights respected, can we execute our brand the way we want to. We assess that risk, and the people in Oak Brook assign a hurdle rate to every market we do business in. Obviously, in some parts of the word the hurdle rates are much higher than in others. We also consider regional overhead and so we definitely have different hurdle rates for different parts of the world. In looking at different markets, we also look at how much risk is there relative to the upside in the market. So we\u2019ve gone on record as saying we\u2019re extremely bullish in China and even though we\u2019re not earning the kid of return there that we earn in the US, we\u2019re very optimistic that returns which are probably high single/low double digit today are going to grow very fast. We see a lot of potential and so we\u2019re not applying an overly drastic hurdle rate to the situation in China. In other parts of the world we have a very high hurdle rate to justify further investment. \nA - Michael Roberts : The only thing I\u2019d add, David, is that you look at the markets that we\u2019re going to be growing in, as Matt said, their hurdle rates are high here but the bulk of our openings this year will go to Australia, China, France, Russia, Spain and the US. In those markets, we\u2019re showing significant movement in margins.\nMary Kay Shaw: Our next question is from Mark Kalinowski at Buckingham.\nQ \u2013 Mark Kalinowski, Buckingham Research Group: Hi. I just wanted to ask about the share repurchases and their effect on the diluted share count. I was disappointed that the diluted share count in the Q1 income statement wasn\u2019t down more from the Q4 levels given all the money that was applied to share purchases in the quarter. I just wanted to understand better why that was, and perhaps going forward, maybe if the share repurchases aren\u2019t having a meaningful effect on the diluted share count, it might make more sense for McDonalds to meaningfully raise its dividend yield to the 3%+ range. I just want to get your thoughts on that. Thanks.\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Mark, it\u2019s Matt. We don\u2019t think that you nor we will be disappointed by the time we get to the end of the year on the share count issue. We\u2019ve said last year at our analysts\u2019 meeting and we\u2019re still committed to it; that we\u2019re going to return $5-6 billion to shareholders in 2006/07, we have reserved the right to be flexible on how much in each year and how much takes the form of dividend versus share repurchase. None of that has changed. Let me comment a little bit on what\u2019s going on. We used to grant options to employees at a much higher rate than today. If you looked at 2004 and 2005 together, our employees exercised options and turned them into shares for a total of 60 million additional shares out there in 2004 and 2005. The annual grant we did in 2005 was, I believe, 7 million shares roughly, six tenths or seven tenths of a percent of the outstanding share base. We\u2019ve brought down the grants. Employees are exercising options that were granted many years ago. We\u2019re starting to be much more aggressive about share repurchase and I think by the end of the year, this will come together and you\u2019ll see some meaningful reduction. We bought back $1 billion worth of stock in Q1, we were a little bit disappointed ourselves about the sequential decrease in the share count. Part of what you\u2019re seeing is driven by Q4 activity on the part of our employees, we\u2019re going to continue to be aggressive in Q2 and again by the end of the year, we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed with what happens to the share count. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman Sachs.\nQ \u2013 Steven Kron, Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. Good morning. A quick question on the developmental license agreements. Matt, you mentioned and you wrote in the 8-K that you don\u2019t expect a material impact in 2006 and I\u2019m just wondering, he emphasized that it\u2019s going to take time, wondering whether kind of progress to date in identifying these candidates might be proving to be a bit more difficult in some of these regions, or is this kind of tracking as you planned?\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Steven, it\u2019s definitely tracking as we planned. Just for perspective, we mentioned that we DL\u2019d two markets in 2005 that had 325 restaurants. We began that work about 2.5 years ago, a full two years before we got the market DL\u2019d. It takes some time to find the right partner, we\u2019re on track, we believe we\u2019ll get this all done within the three years, and we have other countries that are moving along rather quickly. We think it\u2019s absolutely on track. If we were in a hurry to do this, we would end up with the wrong partners and in the long run the business would be hurt. The people doing this work have done it in 32 other countries, they know very much what they\u2019re doing and in the long run we think this will be a good thing for our shareholders and for brand McDonalds. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman Brothers.\nQ \u2013 Jeffrey Bernstein, Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you very much. Specifically on Europe, I know we\u2019ve heard on a number of occasions, it\u2019s difficult to come up with a timetable for the UK turnaround. I\u2019m just wondering what kind of targets you\u2019ve set, or what measures you look at to assess your ongoing turnaround efforts, especially if you look to 2006. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the balance between driving traffic, perhaps through discounting, versus tolerance in terms of potential margin deterioration? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Well, Jeff, in terms of our comps in Europe, they were some of the strongest we\u2019ve had in 2005, well over 2%. I think the strongest in 10 years. And to begin the quarter up 2% is very encouraging. France continues to lead the way with all of their activities related to the five Ps. Germany now has made a major move with the Einmal Eins and new food news and the UK is back focused on Quarter Pounders with Cheese, the relaunch of their pound saver as well as their reimaging work, including some refranchising of restaurants. And so, the overall margin in Europe improved QoverQ, and we\u2019re optimistic about that area. Russia continues to outperform all of our expectations, so the combination of France, Germany and Russia and the movement that we\u2019re seeing as well in the UK now with their focus on improving QSC and their calendar related to new food news gives us optimism about the rest of this year. \nA - Michael Roberts : Jeff, the measures we look at, they wouldn\u2019t surprise you. We look at our F-Trex(?) scores from polling customers on their experience at McDonalds and their impressions of the brand, margins, returns, growth and guest counts. We like what we see in all of Europe and we see the beginnings of some progress in the UK, but we still have a long way to go. And the issue of couponning, the two markets that probably did the most of that back in 2004 and 2005 were the UK and Germany. The UK will be couponning about half as much as it did in the prior year and Germany maybe not at all in 2006. So we\u2019re relying less on couponning, we\u2019re trying to build loyalty the right way. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Glass at CIBC\nQ \u2013 John Glass, CIBC World Markets: Good morning. My question is on the US product pipeline. This year it seems that the new product introductions are front-end loaded, at least the ones we know about today: coffee, spicy chicken etc. I guess, is that accurate? And why did you choose to cluster them that way? Mike, are you suggesting that maybe some of the new products you\u2019re testing now may be available for rollout in the second half? Or are they maybe 2007 events?\nA - Michael Roberts : John, as you know, we\u2019ve got a very robust pipeline that we\u2019ve been working on there for four years. We probably have 20 products in test now in the US and I\u2019m very encouraged with all the movement they\u2019ve had on chicken. You\u2019re absolutely right, John, we launched the spicy chicken, our new coffee and our breakfast platform, and Monday we launched the Asian salad. Three very, very important products for us and we continue to look at Q3 and Q4 and our test sells, to see what\u2019s possible. But, John, you know, with all the new food news, with extended 24 hours, Cashless now, gift cards, the dollar menu, our reimaging, there\u2019s a lot of reasons to visit McDonalds in addition to all the new food news. Lastly I tell you, part of what we\u2019re doing I think much better there now is that we\u2019re relaunching. We\u2019re reintroducing products that we launched a year ago, so you know, we just launched premium chicken. It\u2019s hard for us to understand this, but even after three years, some 40% of our customers don\u2019t know we have salads with Newman\u2019s Own dressing, which tells us there\u2019s a really important thing that they need, which is the continual mentioning in our marketing plans of the products we already have. Looking at the rest of the year for the US, they have products in test. We\u2019ll see what develops here, but they\u2019ve got a lot of products they launched the last two years, that they can re-hit. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Miller at Prudential.\nQ \u2013 Larry Miller, Prudential Equity Group: Thanks very much. First, if I could just follow up on the share count. Maybe you seem to imply the actual share count at the end of the quarter might be much lower. Do you have that number handy?\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Larry, I\u2019m not going to get into a discussion on numbers. The message I\u2019m trying to send is that some of the things that show up in the Q1 numbers might be the result of things that happened in Q4 2005. If we had employees exercise options in Q4 2005, on average, those new shares were only outstanding for a part of Q4 2005, but they were outstanding for all of the Q1 2006. It\u2019s a very complicated computation and I don\u2019t want to, over the call, try to get into the details. But I assure you, by the end of the year, you will be satisfied with the amount by which we\u2019ve reduced the share count.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nQ - Joe Buckley, Bear Stearns: Thank you. A couple of questions on the US. In the quarter, US operating income was up 17%. It looked like your margin dollars were up about 11% or so. It sounds like you spent a little bit more on SG&A, so I\u2019m wondering if you could close that gap? And maybe at the same time talk about the US check experience, and if you would maybe some of your product mix experience over the past six months or so?\nA - Michael Roberts : I\u2019ll deal with the SG&A issue. Joe, we were a little bit concerned at the growth in SG&A in Q1. We went back over our plans for spending, we\u2019re very satisfied that by the end of the year, the relationship of our SG&A increase to our sales increase will be healthy. We target that we don\u2019t want our SG&A to increase more than 70% of our sales increase globally. We think we\u2019re on track to have that kind of a year. We were very concerned by the front-end loading of the SG&A this year, but it\u2019s mostly driven by the Olympics and when our convention is taking place. So I think you\u2019ll see a good relationship there. \nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Joe, I\u2019d just add, our average check is up. As you know, over 50% of our comp the last two years is derived from our chicken play now, the coffee that we launched along with our breakfast platform, not only its increased coffee sales but our breakfast day part is increasing, so the combination of all three is very good.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch.\nQ - Rachael Rothman, Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning. Can you just remind me, because I\u2019ve forgotten, what percentage of your stores in the US are currently operating with extended hours? What percentage have been remodeled. And I believe you have Cashless everywhere \u2013 is that correct?\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Yes, Rachael, we have Cashless everywhere. We have over 13,000 now, almost all of our restaurants are on some form of extended hours. Nearly 4,000 of those are on 24 hours, either 7 days a week or at least Friday and Saturday nights which in some markets is a really important play for our operators. By the end of this year, we will have reimaged in the United States over 5000 restaurants. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Andy Barish, at Bank of America.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Barish, Bank of America: Going back to the UK and its potential improvements, you actually saw in the way you guys talk about the margin impact, about half the impact in Q4. You mentioned about 70bps of an impact on European margins overall and it was about 150bps in Q4. Was that purely the actions you\u2019ve taken that showed up in Q1, or have those not really shown up in terms of store closures and refranchising yet? \nA - Michael Roberts : The actions we\u2019ve taken really haven\u2019t shown up yet. And you\u2019re right, the drag on Europe\u2019s results from the UK has lessened fairly significantly. We\u2019re encouraged by that, but we\u2019re still not anywhere close to being happy with what we\u2019re producing. \nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Andy, we\u2019re excited about their focus on our core menu in the UK. We\u2019ve got the double cheeseburger, we\u2019ve got the double QPC, combined with the Pound Saver menu, they just finished Monopoly, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve run it in about 11 years. We\u2019re encouraged by the progress there on the calendar and they\u2019ve got a very assertive calendar for the rest of the year, with a bigger Big Mac, some \u2018I\u2019m lovin it\u2019 desserts over the summer, free Coke glass promotion with an EVM in August and this is our core menu. And I\u2019m really encouraged by this.\nA - Michael Roberts : Andy, one last thing, in the UK we\u2019ve seen some very nice activity surrounding opportunities at McDonalds. We\u2019ve received some nice coverage and it\u2019s a part of making sure that we position the brand in the right place. \nQ \u2013 Andrew Barish, Bank of America: A quick follow-up on toasted deli over there, you didn\u2019t mention that, Mike?\nA - Michael Roberts : Well I think delis are doing reasonably well over there, Andy. I\u2019m not overly impressed with how well we\u2019ve rolled that out there. The UK consumer you know loves sandwiches, we made modifications to our delis in Canada and I\u2019m excited about that possibility. The UK is focused now on our core menu, including breakfast. And breakfast is doing better over there.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Peter Oakes at Piper Jaffray.\nQ \u2013 Peter Oakes, Piper Jaffray & Co: Mike, you mentioned up front when you were discussing Europe, that the QSR market as a whole is down there. That\u2019s something that\u2019s been discussed quite a bit, at least as far as Germany for a number of years, but you characterized Europe as a whole QSR market being down. I\u2019d be curious, if you could delve into that a little bit more as to what other geographies you\u2019re seeing that kind of macro pressure in? Is it weather-related etc., that can distort Q1. Also, Matt, I think you mentioned you\u2019re starting to get better coverage in the UK \u2013 can you add a little more color what you mean as far as some of the media support and how that\u2019s swinging in that direction?\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: On the media issues, in all of our restaurants now, there are posters that describe the kinds of flexible schedules and opportunities we give our crew. We\u2019ve seen a lot of favorable coverage of that. Coverage that we might not have received a few months ago because the media in the UK was looking to find a negative story. So we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re receiving a little bit fairer treatment on some of these issues. We still have a very long way to go. \nA - Michael Roberts : Yes, and Peter, I would just tell you that globally, the IEO is growing, roughly in the neighborhood of $35 billion per year. Overall, the QSR market is growing. In my mind, we\u2019re competing more and more in the IEO market, vis a vis our products, and on the look and feel of our restaurants. I would tell you that Germany is a great example, even in a very difficult market with unemployment high and inflation high etc. They\u2019re posting very solid results, which is an indication to everybody in McDonalds that when we do what we can do best, which is focus on our plan to win and our five Ps and our customer with a very solid, everyday low price platform, plus new food news, plus reimaging plus McCaf\u00e9, that we can do very well. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Our next question is from John Ivankoe at JP Morgan.\nQ \u2013 John Ivankoe, JP Morgan: Thanks. I know you mentioned extended hours, which great, but I mean could you talk about other speed of service or operational initiatives that might be out there to increase throughput at the stores or traffic at the stores from an operational perspective? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Yes. One example certainly is that the Cashless is helping speed service. Mike taught me this. The Cashless transaction takes maybe four seconds to ring up, making change with cash takes on average 15 or 16 seconds. As that piece of our business grows, our service will speed up, that\u2019s one example.\nA - Michael Roberts : John, I think you know in our plan to win we have measures against every one of the things we\u2019ve spoken about: quality, service, cleanliness and value. In Latin America, Europe and AMPA(?) we are making a lot of progress. North America is making progress as well, not as much as we\u2019d like on fast and friendly, but a lot of progress there. The program internally is called shift into overdrive. It\u2019s a program whereby leadership from around the region can visit each and every restaurant and discuss all of these attributes with our management and with out crew, and work to help them do a better job with hiring and with retention, and with training. I would tell you there\u2019s no secret here, it\u2019s just every day effort around the world in terms of improving our customers\u2019 experience.\nMary Kay Shaw: Next question, we have a repeat question from David Palmer at UBS. \nQ \u2013 David Palmer, UBS Warburg: Hi. Just a follow up on that Mike, I was just reviewing that article from QSR, a magazine where they have their Drive Thru survey and it looks like McDonalds, among others, continues to go the wrong way on Drive Thru speed and I think McDonalds continues to have some struggles here on Drive Thru accuracy. Could you maybe address that, it seems to be an ongoing issue, but meanwhile your sales are telling, obviously, another story about consumer satisfaction. How should we interpret this stuff?\nA - Michael Roberts : First of all, David, what\u2019s really important is that our Drive Thru business as a comp is growing. We\u2019re doing the right things. We\u2019re attracting guests to our restaurant. In terms of speed, you know, this is something that, with our customer order display, with our new POS system, we\u2019re making it easier for our crew people to take orders. A significant percentage now of orders in Drive Thru are using Cashless, as Matt said this is about a four second transaction. That really helps our crew people execute in the Drive Thru. We\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives that we\u2019re working on related to accuracy in terms of positioning of equipment and having all of the right product at the presenter\u2019s booth, which is important. I would just tell you that, you know, related to our mystery shops, we continue to make progress there. All of our teams are incentivized to improve where we are today. We\u2019re making progress here. I\u2019d like every order to be fast and accurate and friendly, and that\u2019s what our areas of the world share as well, as with our operate leadership around the world it\u2019s a major focus for 2006.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Miller at Prudential.\nQ \u2013 Larry Miller, Prudential Equity Group: Thank you very much. I think in some of the recent sales releases, you\u2019ve talked about improved coffee results. I was just wondering, are you seeing therefore incremental sales and incremental margin? Or is it a swapping from other beverages like soda and juice? I also have one other question if you could let me do that?\nA - Michael Roberts : Larry, our coffee business since we launched is up significantly, double digits in fact. Our breakfast comp is up in Q1 as well. What we learned here is that, you know, we have some breakfast rejecters if you will, who didn\u2019t think our coffee was as good as it could be. Now that they know it\u2019s better they\u2019re coming to McDonalds, so coffee combined with our breakfast sandwiches is leading our breakfast comp. The opportunity here I think is enormous. Related to other plays with coffee, we\u2019ve got a very competitive price point at about a dollar for the 12-ounce cup, with the new packaging and the new lid and a robust cup of coffee, I think we\u2019ve got a pretty compelling offer for our guests. \nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: The breakfast business is really nicely positioned for us. It\u2019s very large, we get very good value scores for our customers and it producers a very attractive margin for us. \nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nQ - Joe Buckley, Bear Stearns: Thank you. I want to go back to my first question, I phrased it badly. What I was asking is how the US operating income was up so much, 17%. You know, given the margin dollar increases of maybe 11-12% and it sounds like higher SG&A? Then, as a second question that I\u2019d like to ask, how far back has China come? Do you think your business there is back to a normalized level, or \u2013 put some parameters around the improvement that you\u2019re seeing?\nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Joe, this is Matt. We\u2019re probably going to have to have you talk to IR one on one about the US question, because I\u2019m afraid \u2013 it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s probably me, I just don\u2019t understand your question. On China, we\u2019ve not come back as far as we\u2019d like to, you know, our margins are improving, our comp was positive, we love what we see from the Drive Thrus, we love what we see in terms of future opportunity, we\u2019re growing into the economies of scale that we enjoy in a lot of other markets; we\u2019re not all the way there yet. We are very positive, you\u2019re going to see a lot of movement in building Drive Thrus in China from us. We think we can do it better than anybody. So China\u2019s going to be a big investment and a big opportunity for us. Having said all of that, I have to remind everybody that we can build a restaurant in China with about one fourth of the CAPEX it takes to build a restaurant in the US. Once in a while, you know, we\u2019re not perfect, if we make a real estate mistake in China, you can get out of a lease at no penalty at 95% of the locations we have by giving three months\u2019 notice. So we don\u2019t expect to make mistakes, but we can afford to be a little bit more aggressive than we\u2019ve been in the past. \nA - Mary Kay Shaw: I can add on to the G&A question, Joe, this is Mary Kay \u2013 you know, we don\u2019t give you the G&A by segment for the quarter, but keep in mind one of the things Matt talked about that drove the increase was the Olympic cost in Europe, so that was a big part of the increase and corporate was higher. So US G&A was more in line as what you would expect, so that\u2019s probably why operating income looks that way that it does. Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman.\nQ \u2013 Steven Kron, Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. Just a follow up on the UK and the refranchising that you\u2019ve done so far and that you plan on doing on a go forward basis. Are these refranchised stores going to existing franchisees or new franchisees, and I guess given the negative comp pressure that you have there and other cost pressures, are you giving any kind of concessions to that rent and royalty which I think, on average from the 10-K, was around 17% in the European region?\nA - Michael Roberts : Steve, the bulk of these restaurants will be franchised to existing owner-operators, and our leadership there, Peter Beresford and Steven Easterbrook and I and Denis Hennequin, our President in Europe, we\u2019ve all discussed this. The operators there are very excited about growth. We haven\u2019t opened many new stores there, or many new restaurants in the last couple or three years, and on a case by case basis we\u2019re looking at pre-debt cash flow and sales and the opportunity in front of us to make it right for those operators to be able to compete in that market place effectively. We\u2019re going to look at those P&Ls on an individual operator to operator basis, but the bulk of those restaurants will go to existing owner-operators. \nA \u2013 Matthew Paull: Steve, I\u2019m pretty sure that we covered this on the January call, but if we didn\u2019t I\u2019ll say it here. You know, we look pretty carefully at the differences in P&Ls between us running a restaurant and an operator running a restaurant in different parts of the world, and we described in great detail what those difference look like in the US. We commented back then that the part of the world where we saw the greatest difference was in the UK, where our operators seemed to do a much better job of running the restaurants than we could. They did a better job of making the restaurant more locally relevant. I think in the area of concessions, I think it\u2019s much less likely to be necessary there because our operators simply run better stores there than we\u2019re capable of running. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. It looks like we are out of questions, so thanks everyone, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike for a couple of closing comments. \nMichael Roberts : Thank you again, everyone, we appreciate your interest in McDonalds. In closing we\u2019re pleased with the quality of our Q1 earnings and through our intense focus on building relationships with our customers and through the execution of our locally relevant plan to win. We intend to build on the momentum we\u2019re currently enjoying. Thanks so much.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call, you may now disconnect."}], "2008": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2007, "date": "2008-01-28 17:26:29", "content": "Executives: Mary Kay Shaw - Investor Relations James A.

I am pleased to report that our continued focus on our Plan-to-Win and commitment to financial discipline resulted in a strong fourth quarter and outstanding year for McDonald's and our shareholders. We delivered comparable sales increases of 6.7% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year. Our revenues reached a record high for the year at $22.8 billion and we achieved full year operating income growth of 19% in constant currency excluding the effect of the Latin American transaction. And we returned $5.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Looking ahead, while there\u2019s been some volatility in the market, we are confident in McDonald's future. Trends are in our favor and we are operating from a position of strength. Globally, eating outside the home continues to be a growing opportunity fueled by consumers\u2019 increasingly busy lifestyles and McDonald's remains one of the best positioned brands to capitalize on these trends.  We have the best locations in the industry run by committed franchisees who are financially strong and able to invest in their businesses, all backed by formidable marketing that resonates with our consumers.  In addition, we have the right infrastructure and leadership in place and we\u2019re more aligned than ever before in our history and expect to deliver another year of growth in 2008.  Starting with the U.S., we continued to strengthen our position. Full year comparable sales 4.5%, supported by a 2.3% increase in guest counts. December comparable sales were flat primarily due to severe weather conditions across the country which negatively impacted us by about two percentage points. While we don\u2019t like to single out weather as a factor, the reality is that it impacts food businesses more than other retailers because we\u2019re such a convenience play and I do want to point out that we captured market share dollars every month of the quarter in the U.S., including December.  I also want to offer my perspective on the U.S. economy. We acknowledge that the general retail industry here seems to be impacted by the current economic environment. Historically though McDonald's has not been as affected by a slowdown in consumer spending as other retailers because of our everyday affordability. We offer great value for the money and we have a convenience advantage.  So while we generate better results in a booming economy like everyone else, we\u2019ve navigated through tough times before and we\u2019re confident that we can do it again. Our best estimate on the economy is it will impact our business by one to two percentage points in the U.S. on our same-store sales trendline while the current economic environment exists.  In January, we do expect to deliver comparable sales increases of around 1.5%. Looking ahead, our 2008 plan encompasses a strong value platform coupled with higher margin growth opportunities including chicken, breakfast, and beverages.  Our dollar menu will continue to be an integral part of our success. In times of slowing consumer confidence, this value component really connects with customers. As a result, we\u2019ve seen a slight product mix shift to more value menu items. But it\u2019s not outside our historical range of 13% to 14% of sales, even in December, and we do not expect these levels to change much throughout the year.  On the food front, we expect the McSkillet breakfast burrito, not so easy to say, will continue to bolster our morning business. We will also launch new menu items this year starting this spring with our Southern Style Chicken. We will offer a Chicken Biscuit Sandwich at breakfast and a new chicken sandwich during the rest of the day.  Throughout the next 18 months, we will roll out our specialty coffee. This is the first component of our beverage strategy that also includes iced coffee, sweet tea, smoothies, frappes, and a great variety of fountain and bottle beverages.  Now it won\u2019t be until later in 2009 that we will see the full sales benefit of specialty coffee but we are very excited at the opportunity to grow our share in this $60 billion beverage category. And we\u2019re extremely confident that our thorough testing has resulted in processes that will keep operations running smoothly. We test everything very effectively before we initiate any new opportunity in our restaurants. We will continue to deliver all of our menu items at the speed of McDonald's.  There will be investment costs to incorporate the beverage platform into our restaurants. As we\u2019ve done in the past, McDonald's will co-invest with our franchisees. It\u2019s important to know that this investment fits in our 2008 U.S. capital expenditure budget.  Overall in the U.S., we continued to see a solid foundation and strong future. We know there continues to be upside potential through a combination of everyday affordability and new food news and we\u2019re in great position to optimize that opportunity and deliver growth in 2008.  Now, moving to Europe, a strong December capped off an equally strong year. Full year comparable sales were up 7.6% with a healthy increase in guest counts as well. January looks like it will be another good month with an expected comparable sales increase of 8% to 9%.  This year, Europe will build on the momentum through the Plan-to-Win strategies of upgrading the customer experience through re-imaging and drive-thru. We believe the opportunity exists to increase our drive-thru business by enhancing our advertising, operations, and innovation.  Building transparency is the second strategy which comes alive through innovative marketing and communications that will continue to enhance consumer perception and drive visits.  And third is enhancing local relevance through new menu platforms.  These strategies are coming to life in our major European markets in the following ways. In the United Kingdom, we will continue improving the customer experience by re-imaging restaurants for a more contemporary and relevant dining experience. We have re-imaged 140 high street locations over the past 18 months and expect to re-image an additional 200 restaurants this year with an emphasis on drive-thru, as I mentioned.  We continue to capture more visits through extended hours. For example, earlier opening hours are appealing our breakfast business, led by a 22% increase in coffee sales, and there\u2019s much more opportunity to be captured. We will also continue to run new menu promotions in the U.K. around chicken and premium burgers.  We recognize that certain U.K. retailers reported lower than expected results in their fourth quarter but others are strong. We have not seen a slowdown as our U.K. business momentum continues this month and we are confident about our prospects for the year.  In Germany, we are building on our value program by introducing a fourth menu tier which is priced between their version of the dollar menu, the [Ein Melines], and the core menu. This fourth tier has been very successful in driving trade-up and visits in France and we expect the same in Germany.  An aggressive re-imaging program will continue with the goal of having 100% of our German restaurants reimaged by the end of 2009. An integral part of this program is the popular McCafe, a separate, upscale area of the restaurant offering cappuccino, lattes, and pastries. We plan to add about 100 McCafes this year, bringing our total in Germany to 500 by year\u2019s end.  France continues to fire on all cylinders and report solid results as their premium sandwiches and food news continues to resonate with customers.  And Russia continues to deliver strong results. On a per-store basis, they continue to be most profitable restaurants in the world and this year we will add another 40 new restaurants on a base of just over 200.  We will grow sales in this country of 143 million consumers through drive-thru expansion, a convenience that is relatively exclusive to McDonald's, and through new menu items to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for chicken.  In Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, we had a recording breaking year with a comparable sales of 10.6% and a strong increase in guest counts. We\u2019re beginning the year with another solid month and we expect January comparable sales in Asia-Pacific Middle East Africa to be about 6% or 7%.  Our three largest markets, Japan, Australia, and China, are driving these results. In addition to our large markets, it\u2019s worth noting that we have consistent results across APMEA. In fact, 24 of the 37 countries reported double-digit comparable sales increases for the year.  China continues to build momentum with double-digit comparable sales increases for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These results are being driven by a focus on convenience, value, and food.  Over half of our restaurants in China offer 24-hour service and they are out-comping the national average by about 6%. The relaunch of a more relevant value menu is driving guest counts while maintaining margins, and breakfast has sustained outstanding growth of 60%.  In 2007, we will add 106 restaurants and -- added 106 restaurants and plan to add 125 in \u201908. This is on the base of 876 restaurants going in.  Moving forward, APMEA will continue to focus on the Plan-to-Win platforms that fueled 2007 performance, including such things as convenience, which contributed most of comp sales gains through a mix of extended hours, drive-thru expansion, delivery, and kiosks. These initiatives are still in their infancy and we expect them to continue delivering growth over the next several years as we replicate and scale across the region.  Breakfast is also a significant growth driver for APMEA and represents a $0.5 billion opportunity. And continued activity in core menu extensions and value will also deliver increased sales and guest count.  Now, turning to financial discipline, in 2008 we will invest $2 billion balanced between re-investment and new restaurant openings, which is in line with our growth strategy to be better, not just bigger. This year we will open about 1,000 new restaurants and after routine closings, our net new unit growth is expected to be in our targeted 1% to 2% range as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. We\u2019re increasing the number of restaurant openings in our major markets as well as our high potential markets of Russia and China. We expect to continue increasing the number of restaurants each year at a pace that enables us to invest in our existing base and capture new opportunities. It\u2019s a balance act and we believe this is the right formula for us.  In addition to investing in our business, we are also returning cash to shareholders. We committed to returning at least $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders in 2007 to 2009 through share repurchases and dividends. In 2007, we returned $5.7 billion of that commitment.  Now, before I turn it over to Peter, I want to reiterate our confidence that 2008 will be another good year for McDonald's and our shareholders, despite the macro environment in the U.S. Our global business is robust. Every area of the world is delivering strong results and we are well-positioned to capture the growth opportunity in the marketplace.  Now, I would like to introduce our newly appointed CFO, Pete Bensen. I know Pete\u2019s been out meeting with some of you but for those who have not met him and had that pleasure, I would like to say a few words about how delighted I am to have him as our CFO.  Pete is a highly experienced McDonald's executive who has worked with us for more than 12 years. I am confident that Pete will continue to lead our financial strategy with the same focus and discipline that has delivered value to our system and shareholders.  Pete. \nPeter J. Bensen: Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s great to speak with you today on my first quarterly earnings call. It\u2019s even better to report another quarter and year of strong performance. And while today I may be new to my role, I\u2019m not new to the numbers and not new to helping manage the intersection of strategy and discipline to optimize our focus on being better, not just bigger. Our 2007 results reflect the success of this constant focus.  Fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.06 included a net $0.33 of tax benefit, consisting of $0.26 per share resulting from the completion of the IRS review of our 2003 and 2004 tax returns, $0.09 related to the recognition of certain foreign tax credits, partly offset by $0.02 of expense due to a tax law change in Canada. These items resulted in a significantly lower effective tax rate for the quarter and brought our full year rate to 34.6%. Excluding the Latin America transaction, the completion of the IRS review, and the tax rate change in Canada, the rate would have been 30.5%. In 2008, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 32%.  Full year earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.93 included $0.24 of tax benefits, including the IRS review, offset by the higher Canadian tax rate, plus $1.30 of next expense related to the transition of our business in Latin America to a developmental licensee organization, a transaction that better positions us from a customer and shareholder perspective. Our customers will see us become even more convenient and locally relevant and our shareholders will benefit from improved returns and a more reliable cash flow. As previously disclosed, last year\u2019s earnings from continuing operations of $2.29 included $0.09 of expense primarily related to strategic actions to improve profitability.  Adjusting for all these items, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 26% in 2007, or 21% in constant currency.  Overall profitability improved in 2007 with our combined operating margin excluding impairment and other charges up 250 basis points to 24.4%. Our goal is for this measure to steadily improve on an annual basis as we continue to grow company-operated and franchise margins, as well as continue to exercise G&A discipline. I\u2019ll discuss each of these components in a little more detail, starting with G&A.  In constant currencies, G&A was down for the quarter and flat for the year, primarily due to the reduction in G&A expenses in Latin America. We remain committed to controlling G&A. In 2008, we expect G&A to decline in total dollars and as a percent of revenues and sales versus 2007. However, there will be some fluctuation between quarters as we lap the Latin America transaction and incur expenses related to our worldwide owner-operator convention and the Beijing Olympics later this year.  Turning to margins, total consolidated restaurant margin dollars increased by nearly $1 billion in 2007, reaching a record of $7.9 billion. About one-third of this was generated by company-operated restaurants.  As a percent of sales, the company-operated margins were 17.3% for the year, the highest level since 1999. In the fourth quarter, company-operated margins rose 70 basis points to 17.2%, due to improvement in Europe and Asia-Pacific, partly offset by a slight decline in the U.S.  Positive comparable sales in all our European markets was the key driver behind the company-operated margins increasing 140 basis points for the year to 17.7%, the highest level since 2000. For the quarter, margins rose 60 basis points.  The U.K. accounted for about half the quarter\u2019s margin lift due to improved sales and the change in store ownership mix. Europe\u2019s strong results were achieved despite continuing commodity cost pressures, primarily higher cheese costs, which rose 16%. Our current 2008 commodity outlook for Europe is for cheese costs to increase in the 20% to 25% range, beef to remain relatively flat, and chicken to be up 6% to 8%.  At 15% for the year, Asia-Pacific company-operated margin achieved a seven-year high. In the quarter, margins rose 210 basis points to 14.9%. This marked the segment\u2019s eighth consecutive quarterly increase. Double-digit comparable sales drove margin improvement in China and Hong Kong, the primary contributors to this segment\u2019s increase.  In China, margins benefited from successful initiatives surrounding breakfast and extended hours and economies of scale, partly offset by higher wage rates. Over the long-term, we expect margins will continue to improve in Asia-Pacific as we further leverage our size and scale.  In the U.S., our 2007 priorities included building loyalty and visits by delivering customers great value. We balanced this priority against our goal to maintain strong company-operated margins, achieving margins of 18.7% for the year and 19% for the quarter.  While this was down 40 basis points for the quarter and year, we are pleased the U.S. business attained this high level in an environment of rising commodity and labor costs.  We currently expect the pressures on U.S. commodity prices will continue in 2008. Our outlook is for chicken prices to rise 4% to 5%, cheese to be up 8% to 9%, and beef to remain relatively flat.  Given that this outlook is relatively similar to what we experienced in 2007, we believe these pressures will be manageable. The strength of our supply chain has proven to be a key competitive advantage. By leveraging our scale, close working relationships with suppliers, and effective risk management practices, we are able to lessen the impact of higher commodity costs. As a result, our restaurants\u2019 grocery bill rose by less than half the amount of the food component of the producer price index.  We believe that as we leverage our supply chain strength and continue to focus on dollar menu, breakfast, chicken, beverages, and convenience, we are well-positioned to further drive the business.  Moving to franchise margins, in 2007 this reached $5 billion, or two-thirds of the total margin dollars. As a percentage of revenues, franchise margins increased 80 basis points to 81.5% for the year, the highest level since 1996, driven by strong sales around the world.  Franchise margin dollars are a steady and reliable driver of free cash flow. We expect this contribution will continue to grow as we evolve into a more heavily franchised, less capital intensive business.  We made significant progress in this respect in 2007. In addition to the nearly 1,600 restaurants encompassed in the Latin America transaction, we began the process to transition another five smaller markets in central Europe to the development license structure. And specifically in the U.K. and Canada, our teams collectively refranchised about 130 restaurants during the year. As a result, in the U.K. franchise restaurants now represent 51% of our ownership mix, and in Canada, this percentage rose four points to 69%.  Because of these efforts, to date 78% of our restaurants worldwide are franchised versus 74% a year ago. Looking ahead, we expect this percent to continue to increase as we refranchise 1,000 to 1,500 company-operated restaurants over the next three or so years. Our continued efforts to optimize our mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants will enhance the strength and reliability of our free cash flow, the primary source of cash that we return to shareholders.  In closing, I want to underscore the McDonald's is operating from a position of strength. We will always face challenges, as will any business. But we have a strong brand, resilient business model, the best franchisees and suppliers, and a proven strategy -- our Plan-to-Win -- that provides a dynamic framework for delivering relevant value, menu choice, and restaurant experiences to consumers worldwide. I\u2019m confident that as we continue to execute our Plan-to-Win and exercise financial discipline, we will create greater value over the long-term for our owner-operators, suppliers, and investors.  Before turning it over to Mary Kay for Q&A, I want to say it was great to meet many of you earlier this month and I look forward to working with you in the future.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin the Q&A session. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Matt Difrisco at Thomas Weisel. \nMatt Difrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners: Pete, if you look at the comp trends that we\u2019re hearing in January and the comp trends from Europe and the U.S., it sounds like Europe is doing very well and the U.S. is coming down a little bit. Are you able to -- are those offsets or is there a way to build on the European margins? You set a record in \u201907, doing a comp in the range of high-single-digits like you are now, 8 to 9. Can we get margin improvement on top of the achievements in \u201907 to offset perhaps the slowness or the deleverage going on in the U.S.?\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for the question. Pete will certainly weigh in on this and Ralph is in Europe actually working on margins right now, aren\u2019t you, Ralph?\nRalph Alvarez: That\u2019s right. \nJames A. Skinner: And I think we\u2019ve said all along that in the United States, a 2% comp is important for us to be able to maintain and grow margins and in Europe, that\u2019s around 3%. So when you look at those numbers, you would certainly be able to argue that we ought to be able to have margin improvement and we expect that we will.  To the extent that we are able to leverage that differential of what is required at 3% and then in the additional points of top line improvement remains to be determined but we certainly have plenty of leverage there with the upside growth in terms of the European markets. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman. \nJeff Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: A question for Peter, I guess, on your annual comp sensitivity guidance. I know you mentioned that a one percentage point annual change in the U.S. comp would impact annual earnings per share by I think $0.025. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide some color in terms of the range of comps within which that guidance is reasonable versus perhaps the comp at which leverage or perhaps deleverage would make earnings more sensitive than that. Just trying to obviously figure out EPS vulnerability to slowing U.S. sales, which is obviously a wildcard for most in the industry as we look through \u201908, and perhaps which line item is going to have the greatest deleverage effect. Thanks. \nPeter J. Bensen: We look at that really as general guidance, so we don\u2019t look at whether it\u2019s at a 1% to 2% comp or a 6% to 7% comp. We just look at overall if the comp declines or increases by a point, what does that mean on average? So that\u2019s really just our general guideline \nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from David Palmer at UBS. \nDavid Palmer - UBS: Just a question I guess on the U.S. -- if you\u2019re seeing increased dispersion in growth rates between regions -- for instance, if you are seeing weakness in the West Coast versus the East Coast or in the middle of the country, could you maybe tell us about that and why you think that is? Also, I guess day part wise, I\u2019m wondering if perhaps you\u2019re not seeing those day parts that had been such wonderful growth day parts perhaps not being quite the growth drivers that they once were, most notably breakfast. I was wondering if you could comment on those two things. Thanks. \nPeter J. Bensen: We don\u2019t get into breaking down our comp by region, so we\u2019d prefer not to comment on that.  Regarding the day parts, we continued to see the strength from our breakfast business and our extended hours and convenience plays, so we\u2019re not seeing any slow down in the parts of the business that we\u2019re continuing.  If you\u2019ll remember, in the U.S. our strategies are breakfast, convenience, chicken, and beverages and we are still seeing the strength of focusing on those strategies. \nJames A. Skinner: And David, just to comment on the business across the United States, although we don\u2019t comment on it, we don\u2019t project it, I would have to say that it remains about the same as it has been over the past couple of years, that there\u2019s not been a great disparity and so. And I think we\u2019ve said that before, so there is nothing that we can point to geographically that is making some significant difference in terms of the overall business. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: A question, or a couple of questions tied to each other on the U.S. same-store sales. Can you just talk about the competitive landscape? Certainly everybody is focused on value, everybody is focused on driving the traffic in their stores. Can you talk about how rational the competitive landscape seems to be? And then I guess to that question, maybe comment December and then January to date what you might be seeing from a mix standpoint in the items you are selling on your menu?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, I talked about the mix already and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a movement toward the value, and yet it\u2019s within our transaction measurement of that 13% to 14% that we\u2019ve seen throughout the history of the dollar menu really, so there\u2019s not been an extraordinary shift there.  And then I\u2019d like to have Ralph just comment on the competitive environment and where we see ourselves now relative to the value and that whole perspective. Ralph. \nRalph Alvarez: You know, from a -- you know, January is always a very competitive situation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different than what we would normally see in January. Whether that says as a sustained way with the other folks -- you know, we work our plan. Value is a big component. It\u2019s always a bigger component of our advertising in January, and it\u2019s obvious both from a weather and a disposable income point of view. So we don\u2019t see that as having an impact and like Jim said on the product mix shift, it\u2019s been a very slight product mix shift -- nothing that would tell you something more dramatic is going on. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Glen Petraglia at Citigroup. \nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: In terms of the commodity outlook, Pete, I was hoping you could comment in terms of your confidence level in terms of the increases that you are anticipating. Have you contracted for that? Are these negotiated before the year starts? Thanks. \nPeter J. Bensen: You know, we have a mix of practices that we use, depending upon the commodity. So we do some contracting, we do some open market purchasing. Our suppliers will do some hedging if it\u2019s appropriate based on where they see markets going.  This is our best look today. We feel pretty good but you know, it\u2019s hard to say if things from an economic standpoint worsen, then it would be hard to believe maybe that some of these commodity increases would hold. So I suppose that would be the good news, if things start to worsen a little bit.  But kind of where we sit today, you know, this is really our best look and we feel pretty good at these estimates. And we look at this and update this quarterly, so in the first quarter we\u2019ll be able to give you another perspective. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe at J.P. Morgan. \nJohn Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Two questions, I think they are both actually pretty short. The first, Pete, in your prepared remarks, did you make a comment that you expected company and franchise margins to be up in \u201908? And if you did, was that also by region or on a consolidated basis? And the second question, because you\u2019ve give us some help on U.S. pricing before, could you help us with projected Europe pricing in 2008? Thanks. \nPeter J. Bensen: In my prepared remarks, I did not give an outlook or an projection for \u201908 margins. I was talking in the context of us growing our combined operating margin, which is a combination of company-operated and franchise margin dollars, as well as G&A discipline. So that was the context with which I was talking about growing company-operated and franchise margins.  I think Jim wants to address the Europe question. \nJames A. Skinner: Ralph may want to weigh in on pricing. You know, we were very specific about what we took in \u201907 in the United States, which was 3.5%. And the good news is we have very, very good pricing tools today that maintain a relationship of everyday affordability as well as value across each item on the menu that is very, very balance, always keeping in mind that we are not going to simply pass on all of our costs to the franchise side of the business, as well as passing that along to our consumers through price increases.  So we used the same tool in Europe and I don\u2019t know what they would expect to do this year on the pricing, since we\u2019ve not taken those price increases yet. Ralph, maybe you would like to make a couple of comments about it. \nRalph Alvarez: We use, as Jim said, the same tools. Inflation is very different in countries like Russia than a lot of the rest of the balance of Europe, so it\u2019s important that we do it by country. If you look at \u201907, half of our sales growth, comparable sales growth in Europe came from growth in guest counts. And then we had some growth because of the great new premium products we\u2019ve had, so we will take our price increases throughout the year and we will stay below the inflation that -- the food-away-from-home inflation that\u2019s in the marketplace in order to continue to increase the value perception with our customers, similar to what we\u2019ve done in the U.S. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns. \nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: First, just a clarification question -- the 12% to 14% mix for the dollar menu, is that transactions or actually dollar sales? And then I would like to ask about the U.S. You know, the U.S. economy has been softening for quite a while. This is the first time that your numbers have reflected it at all. What if anything would you point to as to what caught up with you in the U.S.? And then maybe relate that to Europe -- do you think you are in a sweet spot where you can continue to buck trends? Or if the European economies, particularly the U.K., continue to soften, will we see the same kind of reaction some time down the road?\nPeter J. Bensen: To clarify, that 13% to 14% on the dollar menu is actually dollar sales, so the percentage of sales.  On the U.S. economy, you\u2019ve got to remember December was hit pretty hard by weather. As Jim mentioned, we don\u2019t like to give weather reports but it was 2%, which was a pretty significant hit. And so going forward, he mentioned maybe 1% to 2% slowdown in sales.  Again, everything we\u2019re seeing in Europe right now is not showing any of those signs. There were some retailers in the U.K. that have, that reported some weakness but yet some that reported some strength and our business there is really doing great, focused on some of the re-imaging and new products that they are driving. And we\u2019ve got the Plan-to-Win that has all these components that will help us really manage and execute through an environment like that.  So we\u2019re confident that we continue to drive the business and profits will be there. \nJames A. Skinner:  Joe, if I could, just to comment in terms of your -- you said that it looks like it\u2019s caught up with us. This is our snapshot today. If you look at what happened in December which, as Pete has mentioned, we had some extraordinary weather events and we don\u2019t like to look at that unless it was extraordinary, which is what we really felt it was. And if you look at January, when we look at the impact of what we see today we think is 1% to 2%, and the good news is I think the way our infrastructure has been developed over the past three years, including the pricing relationships and everyday affordability and the kind of company we are today, we\u2019re prepared to operate better in that environment than we were three or four years ago, if we end up being subject like everybody else to a downturn.  And yet this is a snapshot and more to be determined as we go through the year and the months here in the United States. And when you look at the U.K., where there\u2019s been some reports of potential downturn and most economists will say that Europe lags by 18 months and all of those kinds of things, we\u2019re not seeing that right now and we think in particular the flexibility that we have by country to manage our business effectively as compared to a sort of macro European environment, as Ralph was talking about, I think that flexibility and the position where we find ourselves in the countries that we do well in, that we\u2019re well-positioned to ride out a problem, if it should happen to come to the European continent and then to the U.K. \nRalph Alvarez: Let me add one point on the U.K. -- the other piece in the U.K. is we have an acceleration of the Plan-to-Win. It took us a little bit longer to get some traction, as all of you know. We had significant operational score improvements in the U.K. this last year that continue. We are accelerating our re-imaging, which was critical for our brand, especially in the high street locations. And we\u2019re seeing that traction and you\u2019ve seen that as we\u2019ve reported here in the last few quarters and that continues. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Speiser at Telsey Advisors. \nMitchell J. Speiser - Telsey Advisory Group: First question is I noticed that your global relative food costs were down 40 bps in the quarter and down about 20 bps for the year. Is that mainly due to mix shifts? And given your cost outlook for \u201908, is it possible for the global relative food and paper costs to be down like they were in \u201907? And then I have a separate question. \nPeter J. Bensen: On the global food costs, that\u2019s really driven by sales. So you are seeing the sales leverage push through there and so we think that\u2019s something that could continue. \nMitchell J. Speiser - Telsey Advisory Group: Great, for relative food and paper to continue to go down in \u201908? Okay, thank you. And separately, just on the Chicken Biscuit launch later this spring, could you just give us a sense of how long that product was tested and maybe how many stores it was tested in non-southern markets? And perhaps what the experience in test it was versus the McGriddle and the McSkillet burrito?\nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, you\u2019re the Chicken Biscuit expert here. Can you weigh in on that for Mitch?\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. We tested obviously in the southern markets, which is important, where there are -- where that\u2019s already a staple and we wanted to make sure we had the right taste profile. But we also tested both the markets with the right level of diversity and both geographic and ethnic, so we\u2019ve been in test for over a year, over a thousand restaurants. And so we\u2019ve got a good handle on what we know the product mix will be for the chicken biscuit. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch. \nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: Can you just give us a little bit of a history lesson, maybe either in the U.S. or globally, about how your business trends during a weak consumer environment? Do you see the contraction later in the cycle or earlier? And then how long does the softness last after demand or general consumer demand rebounds?\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for the question. It really depends on how severe the recession is and as you know, we always talk about McDonald's being recession resistant but not recession proof. And the last, I suppose specifically defined by two consecutive negative quarters of growth was in \u201990 and \u201991. And we are a completely different company today than we were in 1990 and \u201991. We saw a little fall-off in our sales in \u201990 and \u201991 compared to the growth rate, which I think was probably around that 1% to 2% that we\u2019re talking about.  But at that time, the United States represented 58% of the revenues. Today it\u2019s 35% of the revenues. Today we\u2019re more convenient through extended hours, through drive-thru and through cashless and convenience, everyday affordability is in place -- we didn\u2019t have that in place back in the day, if you will. And our margin opportunities are better because of that and we have more franchisees today delivering at a very high level in the alignment of the organization. And I think we were in 58 or 59 countries then, and the penetration of those countries outside the United States was very low. And so we are a completely different company.  So I think the way to look at it really is it is recession resistant, certainly not recession proof, because of the way we are positioned today and the affordability and the convenience and where we find ourselves as a business model and the relevance for our customers here in the U.S. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Howard Penney at FBR. \nHoward Penney - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey : I was wondering if you could provide an update on some of the learning that you are getting from your coffee tests, and maybe provide a target for the number of stores it might be in by mid-year or year-end?\nJames A. Skinner: I\u2019m glad you asked that question. The first thing I\u2019d like to say, what we are finding in our testing is very positive and robust results, both in terms of the overall customer acceptance, as well as the sales themselves and the sales test. And most importantly, our operational capabilities to deliver that initiative and those beverages at the speed of McDonald's.  I know that there was some concern about whether we\u2019d be able to deliver that. That was the reason we do an operations test. It\u2019s been very robust. Ralph, I don\u2019t know, maybe you want to talk about the number of restaurants we\u2019re in today, but we are seeing very positive results there. And I would just say that we\u2019re a company today because of our robust consumer insights. We wouldn\u2019t embark on something like this had we not felt very strongly that we had our act together, if you will, around the operating side of the business.  Ralph, how many -- \nRalph Alvarez: Yeah, and on the timing, definitely won\u2019t have any kind of critical mass until much later into 2009. We are going through the permitting process. It takes time to build these out. We\u2019re doing it in a way that it\u2019s integrated with our drive-thru business and so there\u2019s actually more involved in that construction than just meets the eye, and we have a very specific training programs so that as we do this, we are able to make sure, as Jim mentioned, that the operation is sound, not just for the coffee customers but for the customers that are buying Egg McMuffins and everything else at that time.  So you won\u2019t see that level of critical mass until later in 2009. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Glass at Morgan Stanley. \nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to go back to the competitive environment for a minute. In the past, the company has defended its market share, even if it required a reduction or discounting on a temporary basis. So I guess two questions -- one is would that still be your view if it comes down to that, that you need to defend market share, say above temporary profitability? And maybe secondly, what are the tools available to you besides that? For example, could you increase advertising in \u201908 if necessary, or could you shift it from a national to local windows if you thought that was a benefit?\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for the question, and I want Ralph to weigh in on this specifically but as you well know, with our flexibility and resources, we can do anything we want. If you look at marketing and the potential of repositioning ourselves as appropriate as the environment dictates, but I think in terms of the overall menu and everyday affordability, we\u2019re positioned appropriately today around that but I want Ralph to talk specifically about the potential of discounting. \nRalph Alvarez: What we\u2019re really focused on supporting the everyday affordability platform of dollar menu. We will do other items, as we did this last summer with significant push on drinks, on affordable drinks. But still within that platform, relative to local and national, we spend more than half our money locally versus national and that\u2019s on purpose, so that our franchisees who are closest to the business in their specific markets can have the right programs in place that are best for that market. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re set up. We have been for the last five, six years, and so we think that gives us great flexibility. And we will do what it takes to make sure we grow the business profitably. \nPeter J. Bensen: Just adding one thing, and we\u2019ve talked about this here, is that you are not going to see an all-out return to burger wars where we are discounting our core sandwiches and getting into strictly a price competition. As Ralph said, the local co-ops have the opportunity to see what\u2019s going on and do what makes sense for them but discounting our core sandwiches will not be a bit piece of that. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse. \nKeith Siegner - Credit Suisse: You\u2019ve talked before about the benefit of the pricing tool, particularly for some of the U.S. company-operated stores. Can you update us on the rollout, on the status of the rollout, which regions are yet to get the pricing tool? And then also in relation to the franchisees, which if any have it or which ones might be getting the pricing tools this year?\nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, can you talk about the pricing tool and the universality of it?\nRalph Alvarez: We actually -- it\u2019s both company and franchise restaurants, so franchisees had been using the tool. We have significant penetration, critical mass penetration throughout the U.S. We are now in the majority of the large countries in Asia and the same thing in Europe with the pricing tool, with changes to match those market prices. But it is a piece of our arsenal that we\u2019ve gotten our best learnings and then gone ahead and scaled throughout the world. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Paul Westra at Cowen. \nPaul Westra - Cowen & Company: Just a couple of questions; one more on the U.S., if you don\u2019t mind -- you commented on a 1% to 2% hit from I guess a macroeconomic environment. Could you give us an idea of what that hit is off of? Is that what you were referring to as your, like last year\u2019s run-rate of 4.5 or some other run-rate?\nJames A. Skinner: I think you could look at it any number of ways. It\u2019s really off of what you\u2019ve seen as the run-rate we\u2019ve had over the past 12 to 18 months. But that\u2019s a snapshot, as I said earlier. That\u2019s just with information we have right now as we look at 28 days in January and as I said, as it plays out over the year, I would expect that number will change. Even when you look at commodity costs and other issues with the consumer attitude and the jittery nature of the markets today, those are only projections based on what we see today. I think some of those costs could ease up some but that\u2019s only an opinion. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Difrisco at Thomas Weisel.\nMatt Difrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners: Can you give us or comment on what we\u2019ve been seeing a little bit in the New York area here, that some stores seem to be advertising that they are going to pull out the Double Cheeseburger off of the dollar menu. Is that something that is just confined to the Northeast or is there a potential for that to be broader?\nJames A. Skinner: I think that\u2019s pretty much confined to New York but Ralph, do you want to talk about the Double Cheese in New York?\nRalph Alvarez: Sure. The advertising was voted in by over 95% of the system. We\u2019ve been anywhere between 90% and 95% penetration over the last five, six years and that number is pretty steady right now.  New York, and New York really being mostly Manhattan, has not been on dollar menu exactly the same way throughout that whole time, so it\u2019s an isolated item. Obviously especially in Manhattan you have a significant different cost of operation but it\u2019s not an issue that we have around the U.S. \nPeter J. Bensen: You know, there was -- this gets to Ralph\u2019s point earlier about our local co-ops -- there was a promotion for a few weeks in January where they were running a special on the Double Cheeseburger but it was not part of their consistent dollar menu. \nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Jim and Ralph, in the U.S., it seems like the share gains might be slowing a little bit for you guys, in addition to all this other stuff about the industry growth rates. I mean, if we look at the fourth quarter \u201906 and first quarter of \u201907, kind of the year-ago numbers, your same-store sales were spectacular versus what the average of your peers would have been at that time, maybe four to five points better. And I get a sense that your same-store sales at these levels may be converging with the industry same-store sales while the industry same-store sales is also slowing.  A year ago you guys said that Taco Bell being in the tailspin it was in with e-coli and the rats incident wasn\u2019t really a benefit, but I\u2019m wondering if that might be somewhat of a factor here.  So broadly speaking, thinking about the noise from a competitor being in pain last year and maybe cycling that, and then broadly speaking about competitor, about gaining share, how do you see that? Thanks. \nJames A. Skinner: You asked two different questions and two different things. One was on the comp sales and the impact our competitors have on that and are we converging with their numbers, and I would say that the answer to that is no, and yet I don\u2019t remember us saying any specific thing about our competitor a year ago. I\u2019m sure that was a question that we answered because I don\u2019t think I would allow our people to talk negatively about a competitor and their current environment.  Having said all of that, I think that -- and then the second part of your question is whether that has impacted share growth, market share growth. And as I said even in December, we gained share on a dollar basis in the United States, which is obviously against our competitors.  Having said that, I\u2019d like maybe Ralph to weigh in a little bit on this. Ralph, do you have a perspective?\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah, I think the piece here when you are looking at comps only as the average volumes that we have, which are significantly higher than any other player, combined with the number of restaurants, which are also significantly higher than any of the major players, when we have comps on top of that, we keep on taking market share and our comps continue to be and have been greater than the other players but on top of much significant, both existing share and from a distribution in average volume.  So because of that -- and we look at it. We\u2019ve continued all year long to take market share in the QSR category. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Two quick follow-ups; first, Jim, if we could just go back to the little history lesson, if you will -- certainly a lot of discussion about fiscal and monetary stimulus into the economy. Maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about historically how your consumers responded to fiscal stimulus. Recognizing your business is a little bit different today than it was, but I suspect that despite maybe getting some customers, new customers from the higher side, maybe trading into your business, you still might be losing some at the lower end. So maybe you can discuss a little of that.  And then secondly, just on the beverage platform in general and the test stores, can you discuss the margins within those stores? I would imagine that this beverage platform is a higher margin product but maybe you could just talk a little bit about that. \nJames A. Skinner: I\u2019ll let Peter and Ralph talk about the margins on the beverages but relative to a stimulus and the expected stimulus, all of us are customers at McDonald's and any opportunity for us to have some cash in our hands relative to the opportunity to stimulate the economy is a good thing for all brands and certainly for McDonald's. Whether or not it\u2019s the right stimulus package or whether it\u2019s going to make the most sense for the most number of consumers and all of that wouldn\u2019t be my place to weigh in on it but we certainly look upon it as a positive thing for McDonald's and the side of the business that we are in. \nPeter J. Bensen: Regarding your question on the margins, I\u2019m not going to get into specific what\u2019s happening with the stores but for the beverage products themselves, we see that as a gross profit percentage nearing 80%, which is higher than our average menu items, so we think that\u2019s obviously a positive for margins.  And the other thing about the beverages through the results of our testing is if we look at the beverage initiative like a new product launch, the beverage initiative has delivered the highest level of incremental new customers compared to any other product launch we\u2019ve had, so we\u2019re very optimistic that that combination of it being a higher margin product along with new incremental traffic are both good things for that initiative. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Another question from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: Can you just give us whatever specifics are available on the five units converted to DLEs in Europe? Can you say how large they were or what markets that they represented of the 600 target? [inaudible] -- anything you\u2019ll give us. \nPeter J. Bensen: About five different countries, it was around 40 restaurants all together in the Baltic states and a few others in Central Europe. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. We have time for one more question. It looks like Glen Petraglia from Citigroup.\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: I was hoping maybe to get some clarification in terms of how much G&A will be remaining in Latin America following the transaction. \nPeter J. Bensen: We think it will be less than $20 million on an annual basis. \nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: Thanks. \nJames A. Skinner: But we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re moving through the year. It will continue to go down as we structure ourselves regarding how we\u2019ll continue to have a relationship with Latin America and as you can imagine, in the short-term, the relationship requires a few more people as we transition. And then over the long-term, it will become a smaller number. But as Pete said, ultimately it will be $20 million or less. \nMary Kay Shaw: It looks like we have one more question from Bob Coleman at Gardner Russo. \nBob Coleman - Gardner Russo: With regard to the U.S. system and dealing with a very tight credit cycle and the availability of gathering loans, if you were to put into context the overall spending, either by corporate and the system-wide, is it at all out of balance in terms of overall spending in the way that it should be appropriated? I.E., is the McDonald's company spending more in the system on a per dollar of sale versus the franchisees? And if this is occurring, how would you either correct, mitigate, or assist the franchisee system to get through this credit cycle?\nPeter J. Bensen: We don\u2019t look at the spending on a per sales basis. The credit markets today are, as you acknowledged, a little bit crazy but we\u2019re not seeing any slowdown in the lending to our franchisees. There\u2019s plenty of liquidity out there for them to borrow to, not only through their normal reinvestment but for the beverage initiative. And so as we look at the credit markets, we\u2019re not seeing anything that\u2019s negatively impacting our ability to drive the business forward, either for our franchisees or from the corporate side. \nRalph Alvarez: If I could add, our franchisees, from a debt point of view, are very strong in how they manage that and are not highly leveraged at all. And so it\u2019s something that they watch closely, that we watch closely with them and because of that, they have access to the credits and have access at tradable rates. \nJames A. Skinner: And I think the headline is we are very well-positioned, if you just look at our balance sheets and their balance sheets, relative to operating successfully in the future in this environment that we find ourselves in.  With that, I would just like to make a couple of closing comments and reiterate our optimism and confidence that business momentum will continue in 2008. The diversified nature of our company positions us for continued growth. We have strong operations in 118 markets -- in countries, I should say -- and a brand that is loved by customers around the world. Every area of the world is contributing to our results and that will continue this year.  We have the right infrastructure and plans in place to increase our share of the growing eating out market and we fully expect to deliver another year of growth for our business and strong returns for our shareholders. Thank you all for being here today. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-10-19 17:26:36", "content": "Executives: Mary Kay Shaw - VP of IR Ralph Alvarez - COO Matthew Paull - CFO\nAnalysts: Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs Jeff Bernstein - Lehman Larry Miller - RBC CapitalMarkets David Palmer - UBS Glen Petraglia - Citigroup Jason West - Deutsche Bank Andrew Barish - Banc of America John Ivankoe - JP Morgan John Glass - CIBC Joe Buckley - Bear Sterns Paul Westra - Cowen Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Larry Miller - RBC Jake Bartlett - Thomas Weisel\nOperator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald'sOctober 19, 2007 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald'sCorporation this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentationthere will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (OperatorInstructions). And now I would now like to turnthe call over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations forMcDonald's Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Hello, everyone, andthank you for joining us today. With me on our call are Ralph Alvarez, ChiefOperating Officer and Matthew Paull, Chief Financial Officer. This conferencecall is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast andpodcast. As always, the forward-lookingstatements which appear in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply toour comments. Both the earnings release and our 8-K with supplemental financialinformation are available on investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations ofany non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with theircorresponding GAAP measures. And now, I will go ahead and turnit over to Ralph.\nRalph Alvarez: Good morning everyone. It's agreat time to be in McDonald's. Our business is strong around the world for theevery area contributing to growth and posing positive comparable sales andtransaction accounts. And we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us. I willbegin today's comments with the quarterly results and discuss the strategiesthat are driving momentum. Then Matt will take you through the earnings pershare numbers and provide details about the Boston Market transaction and ourcapital structure. Our management team is verypleased with our results and can assure you that performance this quarter isdue to McDonald's continued focus on the plan to win. Our strong sustainedmomentum is due to our winning strategy of being better and not just better. We are running better restaurantsand have become more efficient given the evolution of our kitchens to provideconsumers with even greater choice and variety. Operational excellence enablesus to capture additional sales from customers who are recognizing our serviceimprovement and rewarding us for it. Equally important, we have system linealignment behind one plant, a compelling benefit for company our size. In addition, our decentralizedorganization is a competitive advantage, because it enables each area in worldto implement aggressive, locally relevant strategies that ensure our brand willappeal to their customers. They have the flexibility to emphasize differentbusiness drivers for their specific market conditions. These drivers fit forthem what we call the common success factors. They are branded affordability.Platforms that offer everyday predictable prices, here in the US you knowthat as Dollar Menu, greater variety in menu choice. Building on our strongcore menu to provide customers with additional food choices that they didn'texpect to get at McDonald's, better operations creating a more satisfyingexperience, expanded convenience, which helps our customers access our brandwhere, when and how they want to and our ongoing reinvestment programs make itour restaurants the most contemporary and best places for both our customersand for our employees. As we go through our thirdquarter results, you will see that all areas of the world are succeeding due totheir local deployment and execution of the common success factors that applyto their marketplaces. For now let's talk about operating income and margins.Driven by strong comparable sales, our revenues increased 3% in constantcurrencies in spite of the Latin America transaction and refranchising ofrestaurants in the UK and Canada. In the US, Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the revenues were up 6%, 7% and 13% respectivelyin constant currencies. Operating income for the quarterreached $1.5 billion, up 13% in constant currencies. Our consolidated franchisemargins were up 110 basis points to 82.3%. Now, in the phase of a morechallenging worldwide commodity and labor environment we are pleased to reportconsolidated company operating margin increased a 100 basis points to 18.3%.This margin expansion is a result of healthy sales growth and a good balancebetween traffic and average check increases and we remain committed to furtherimproving margins as we continue to grow our sales. Let me now provide thedetails about how each area of the world has contributed to our success. First Europe, Europehad a strong quarter with comp sales up 6.5%. Franchise margins increased 80basis points to 79.4 and company-operated margin improved 120 basis points to19.5% the highest level in seven years. This improvement was driven by strongsales across the segment, ownership changes in the UK and supply chain efficiencies.This was also partially offset by increased labor cost and to a lesser extentcommodity cost. These are impressive resultsespecially when compared year-over-year as Europewas up against its best performing quarter from 2006. Nearly all countries in Europe posted strong numbers. We are having consistentperformance across Europe beyond the big three markets of France, Germanyand the UK.Notably, Russia, Italy and Spain are countries with strongresults and the ability to contribute more over time. The European business hasachieved these outstanding results with their continued focus on three corestrategies. Upgrading the customer experience, enhancing local relevance andbuilding brand transparency. We continue to attract customers by featuring avariety of premium products, combined with compelling value options. The goodexample is Europe's expansion of the chicken category, including new chickenproducts at various price points such as the Snack Wraps at an entry level inthe UK and Germany. ChickenSelects at the core level in Germanyand the Chicken Gourmet and Chicken Mythic sandwiches at premium price pointsin Franceand many other countries. Franceis also experiencing success in terms of innovating a rather fourth tier ofmenu pricing with their combination of Le Petit Plaisir for small pleasuresofferings. This strategy is being exported to other markets in Southern Europe with comparable success. Separately, our reimaging work withbest-in-class restaurant designs coming out of our European design studio isalso resonating with customers. In addition to new restaurants openings withdesigns, almost the fourth of the European restaurants, 1,500 of them, over thepast five years have been re-imaged and are adding to overall brand experience. Now, let's turn to the US. In the US momentumcontinues with third quarter comp sales up 5.1%, marking 54 consecutive monthsof positive increases. Performance is especially impressive when put into thecontext of a drop in consumer confidence and the higher gas prices that areimpact the overall industry. USfranchise margins for the third quarter were up 90 basis points to 83.2%,driven by the strong sales mentioned above. Company-operated margins remainedhigh at 18.4%, but did decline 60 basis points versus the same period lastyear. This was primarily due to wage increases and commodities. We have adjusted prices byapproximately 3.5% over the last year. Still below the food away from home inflationindex and we will continue to make adjustments, but do so only with thelong-term health of the business in mind.  As a result, we continue tooutpace the compensation with strong traffic growth, significant market sharegains and growing restaurant cash flow. While we have more pricing power thanever before, our comprehensive value strategy enables us to achieve resultswhile meeting consumer needs for everyday affordability and convenience.  Our three-tier menu approachprovides consumers with the range of menu options. It starts with $1 menu valueplatform, which is now been in place for five years, and continues to bring inconsumer while looking for ways to stretch our wallets and encompasses thehigher end with premium salads and sandwiches.  Another important part of thevalue proposition in the USis the addition of Chicken Snack Wraps. The August introduction of the ChipotleBarbeque Snack Wrap further extends this product line, and is sellingsignificantly above target. By staying in the course, we will continue to buildconsumer loyalty and grow our customer base. We will leverage these gains withadditional rollout of new products from our strong menu pipeline.  In terms of the drivers behindthe quarter's USresults, breakfast and beverages continue to feel that growth, as we providedmore choice and variety. We have continued to capitalize on the strongfoundation we built with last year's successful introduction of Premium RoastCoffee. Overall coffee sales, bothPremium Roast and Ice coffees contributed to the sales increases. Thecreditability we have established in coffee propels us to further expand ourtests of specialty coffees such as cappuccino, lattes and mochas. Also driving US continues to bethe added convenience we offer customers to extended hours.  Late night, early morning and 24hours the gains in market share we've had this year have strengthened ourcompetitive position.  Our US business has a strong plan inplace and the best owner-operators in the industry to execute against it. Now, let's turn to Asia-Pacific,Middle East, and Africa. Robust sales growthin all major countries in Asia-Pacific including Japan, Australia and China,resulted in an 11.4% comp for the quarter, the highest in 10 years.  Franchise margins for this areain the world are strong at 88.4%. In the phase of increasing labor andcommodity cost, company operated margins still improve the 190 basis points to15.8%. This improvement was primarily driven by strong sales, guest counts andimproved operating performance in South Korea,Ankara, Australia. EMEA is achieving theseresults due to their strategy of our everyday predictable value coupled withday far expansion into breakfast and conveniences like extended 24 hours drive-thruand delivery. Now, let me give you somespecifics from our three largest business units there. Japan hasachieved 20 consecutive months of positive comp sales and broke severalprevious sales records are leveraging the popularity of many line extensionsuch as EBI Filet-O and Mega Teriyaki. Our team in China hasrelaunched breakfast simplified our valued platform and continue to promote therange of proteins we offer, chicken, beef and fish. No other quick servicerestaurant in Chinaoffers such a broad variety. Australia has recently drivendouble digit comp sales growth for the focus on big burgers, breakfast andcoffee, they have also benefited from an expansion into 24 hours a series ofsmart price increases.  Now, I would like to switch andtalk about our worldwide ownership strategies. McDonald's previously announcedplans to reduce the number of company operated restaurants by putting more ofthem into the hand of local owner operators and qualified entrepreneurs.  As we look to optimize ourbusiness under the Plan to Win we will continue to evolve our ownership mix bymaking changes in those markets where it makes more sense, either traditionalfranchise agreements or development of licensees.  Today, I want to take a moment toupdate you on the progress we are making as part of this strategy to evolve ourownership to best serve our business needs, our shareholders and our customers. In the last 12 months, we havereduced the percentage of company operated restaurants around the world by 5%or 1,200 units from 27% down to 22%.  In UK, the percentage of companyoperated restaurants decreased by 3% this quarter, bringing the total to 53% ofthe restaurants under company management.  We have also made progress in Canada with acomparable 3% reduction, so that 33% of the restaurants are now companyoperated. Also in the third quarter, wesuccessfully close the transaction to franchise restaurants in 18 LatinAmerican countries. We are pleased to report the transition to convert theserestaurants were seamless for our customers, employees, suppliers andfranchisees. Our Latin America business had another impressive quarter with comp sales up18.3%. With new capital and local entrepreneurship, McDonald's Latin America has a very bright future.  And now, let me turn it over toMatt.\nMatthew Paull: Thank you, Ralph and good morningeveryone. Despite a challenging consumer and cost environment, we'vestrengthened our business build our momentum and delivered solid results withoperating income of 13% in constant currencies to $1.5 billion.  Third quarter earnings per sharewere up from $0.68 last year to $0.89 this year, the $0.89 includes $0.83 pershare from continuing operations an 18% increase in constant currencies over'06 and $0.06 per share representing an after tax gain of $69 million on thesale of Boston Market which closed in August. We received proceeds of about$250 million from this sale. The sale of Boston Market is consistent with oursingular focus on driving growth at brand McDonald. The capital gain on BostonMarket allows us to utilize a greater amount of our capital loss on theLatin-America transaction which also closed in the quarter this resulted in a$0.04 per share tax benefits. However, this tax benefit was offset byadditional charges related to the Latin Americatransaction of $53 million.  Our effective tax rate of 31% inthe third quarter reflects this tax benefit without it or the additionalcharges our tax rate would have been 33.3% for the quarter. The IRS tax audit Imentioned last quarter is nearly complete and we hope to come to a finalagreement soon, until we do so, we cannot provide tax guidance for the comingquarter or the full year.  Since Ralph addressed theoperating results, I'll just touch on a couple of miscellaneous items for thequarter. Other operating income was higher in the third quarter than in \u201806primarily due to higher equity pick up on our Japanese and US affiliates, higher gains on sales of companyoperated restaurants primarily in Canada where we franchised 21restaurants and lower asset disposition costs and other miscellaneous expensesin \u201807.  In constant currencies, G&Adeclined 1% in the quarter partly due to $25 million decrease in Latin America as a result of the DL transaction. Thismorning I also want to discuss our commodity outlook and share some of ourthinking related to our capital structure.  Given our menu variety, there aremany different commodities that we carefully monitor. In the US, dairy andto a lesser extent chicken were the primary drivers that increased commoditycosts in the quarter. Dairy, including cheese, was up 20% to 30% in thequarter, chicken was up 3% and beef was relatively flat. For the year, weexpect dairy to be up 14% to 20%, chicken to be up between 4% and 5% and beefto be relatively flat.  In Europe,third quarter beef costs were down 4% while chicken was relatively flat. Wecontinue to expect beef and chicken costs to be flat in Europefor the year. We are evaluating the current commodity costs environment.  In general, most commodities arecyclical in nature. Historically those cycles have been somewhat predictable.Today, however, we are seeing the beginning of a shift in the demand/supplybalance in many areas of the world that could change these cycles and ourability to predict longer term commodity costs. This shift as most of you knowis driven in part by growing interest in biofuels, which is increasing demandfor corn and soy and is likely to exert upward pressure on other commoditiesincluding beef, dairy and poultry. Higher demand for dairy andprotein in Chinais also contributing to this pressure. We will continue to leverage our scale,global supply infrastructure, and effective risk management practices to helpdeliver predictable competitive prices for our restaurants in a rapidlychanging environment. We believe we can continue to manage consolidated companyoperated margins while driving customer visits and sales given our diversity ofproducts, dayparts in countries, the value our menu offers, our pipeline ofpremium and higher margin products, the convenience of our restaurants, and ourenhanced pricing power and improved consumer relevance. We will update youfurther on our '08 outlook at the Analysts Meeting in November. Now, turning to our capitalstructure. In September, we announced our intent to return $15 to $17 billionto shareholders by dividends and share repurchase in 2007 to 2009. This isabout double the $8 million we returned from '04 through '06. When we set thistarget, we considered all of our sources of cash including cash fromoperations, cash from our balance sheet, our ability to increase leverage andthe proceeds of the Bostonmarket sale.  Most importantly, thisannouncement reflects our confidence in our continued business momentum and thestrength and reliability of our cash flow as we continue to evolve to a moreheavily franchise less capital intensive business model.  We expect to take on fromincremental debt to reach this target. The actual amount and timing of incrementaldebt will depend on business and market conditions and our intent to retain astrong credit rating. We are not giving specific guidance, as we want to retainmaximum flexibility.  As most of you know, when makingcapital structure decisions we consider how the rating agencies look atleverage which is different than what appears on our balance sheet. The biggestdifference is as most of you know is that credit rating agencies view operatingleases as a future cash commitment and therefore consider it a part of totaladjusted debt.  Typically, the rating agenciesuse a factor of 6 to 8 eight times rent, when converting leases to debt.Accordingly, they arrive at a total adjusted debt figure that's much higherthan what is on our balance sheet. Regardless of whether we agree or disagreewith this perspective, it's something we need to consider and manage in ourglobal business and making capital structure decisions. The real headline hereis that our actions to strengthen and build our business by being better notjust bigger have combined to strengthen our free cash flow, a substantialamount of which will be returned to shareholders. In closing, we are confident thatour plan to win will continue to drive McDonald's forward and deliver evengreater value for our customers, our system and our shareholders. Thank you,and now I will turn things over to Mary Kay to begin the Q&A session.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks Matt. I will now open thecall up for questions. (Operators Instructions). First question is from StevenKron at Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Hey, thanks. Good morningeveryone. Question on the USmargins, I guess I am just trying to reconcile the 60 basis point decline. Irecognize there is a bunch of different pockets here, namely the commodity andthe labor side of things. But, I guess as I look at the commodities these beingflat enough to guidance for the year, chicken up for the quarter and expectedto be up for the year, but not an unreasonable amount. And I know cheese wasthe big outlier here. But, I would have expected, given the increasing mix ofwhat I would expect to be higher margin product and around 3% and 3.5% priceincrease that we could maybe defend the margins little bit more. Can you speakto it little bit more specifically, and do you think going forward this 3.5%that you now have in the menu can protect margins a little bit better?\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. Hi, Steven.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Hello.\nRalph Alvarez: Getting back to you on that, inthe third quarter on the USbusiness we were very aggressive on our marketing concern going in to thesummer both the drop in consumer confidence and what was going on with GAAPprices and took a strategy to protect and grow traffic during that time. Andso, if you look at our marketing calendar, the amount of weight we put onDollar Menu advertising, the aggressive launch or extension of Snacks Wraps,attractively priced drinks, sweet ice tea, soft drinks and ice coffee. We didthat on purpose to build traffic at a time that we felt there is going to besome risk. Those items also have a small effect and being diluted on themargins beside the items that we mentioned. The labor had a little bit moreimpact then the food, because there was a minimum wage increase and some ofthat ripples through, for much higher than minimum wage our price point ofview. But the all states moved their reserve also and so we had little bit ofthat ripple and that takes over time. But, the headline is, we are comfortableat margins over the long-term. We are not going to manage it over theshort-term, especially the pricing side of the equation. We believe that's animportant one to spread out over time and we will continue to do so.\nMatthew Paull: And Steven, as you would hereprobably our November 13th at the Analyst Day meeting. We are very excitedabout some of the premium products in the US pipeline. And it is veryimportant to keep guest counts up when you have those kinds of products in thepipeline. Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: For notification, we talked abouthaving about 50%, 55% of our sales growth coming also in guest counts versusaverage checks, it was closer to 70% this quarter.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: In United States?\nRalph Alvarez: In United States\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next is from JeffBernstein at Lehman. Jeff are you there?\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman: Yes, I am. Can you here me?\nMary Kay Shaw: Yes.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes.\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman: I guess my question, you guysmentioned the labor cost, which obviously impacting you worldwide just lookingfor your thoughts by region I know in the US you would seem to be in a minimumwage driven Do you think to be in the minimum waste driven and I think pressurewould begin to ease as we look into '08 based on this lap the state increases.And I guess the federal won't be lap until mid year. Just wondering if youcould talk about the impact in US as we look to '08 and perhaps separately howyou see labor pressures playing out in Europeand EMEA in coming quarters, in other words, mention its limiting profitabilityin each region? Thanks. \nRalph Alvarez: Yeah, and in your labor andmanaging the labor pressures, if something we have on a regular basis, it\u2019sbeen a little bit more intensively US as the minimum wage the national minimumwage finally got adjusted. We think we are in a cycle where those increases nowin the US will be fairlynormal there were some states that took big increases, Michigan is an example they went up a $1.80overnight. And so, if we cycled on those now, it won\u2019t be or you are going tohave flat increase. It's not going to be flat, you are going to have increasesbut they will be at inflation rate. And so, when we have that, then we are fineon margins.  In Europe, Europehas always had, managing wages there is a big issue. Things like what we'vedone with our BOP operating platform make us more productive. Somereinvestments we are doing in July through over there right now, also have notjust customer benefits but productivity benefits. And so, we\u2019ve seen is, theirheadwinds when we talk about it because it doesn't let you better staycompletely from the price increase you took but they are at a fairly normalrate of growth at this point.\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman: Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. Asia,I am sorry. On Asia-Pacific, we're having some higher increases in places like Chinain the geographies that have great GDP happening, that middle class is growingfast. We have that in our models, and so labors are much more percent of ourcost of doing business in those marketplaces, and so when you get a largeincrease here in the wages, it's on a very low base. And so on an overallbasis, as long as we continue to drive the comp sales are doing will growmargins.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question isfrom Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. Thanks, guys. Ralph, youguys have added a lot of new products in the past few years, and I think youplan on adding a lot more over the next couple of years. The beverages and Iguess the Southern Style Chicken sandwiches. And to my recollection, I can'trecall that you've really removed anything. So, I am just curious, can you helpme understand what you are doing from an operations perspective, to handle theincreased complexity, and not jeopardize any kind of speed or service?\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah, absolutely, I am going togo to Europe and Asia, the other places, they are putting in either Made forYou or BOP, so Made for You is what we are putting in all of Asia, Britishoperating platform is also putting in Europe, what we mostly complete, but notby the end of '08, by mid '09 gives us the menu, the operation of the abilityto handle more menu complexion. That combined with the POS improvements thatallow us to take the orders up and more complex menu easier and then have thosepop-up in the back for our kitchens to get ahead of the game. It actually opensup the possibilities for us to handle more products. The other piece we did all aroundthe world is, we did remove low selling items, they are not important becausethat's why they were low selling. But we have been very careful to not, wereset five size of the price, five size of drinks. We are down to three on eachof those, significant benefit on the operating side.  And in Europe,things like the Big Tasty, Chicken Mythics that have help sales a lot. Don'ttake in and out. We don't keep them in. We bring them in for 8 to 12 weeks, geta big benefit and then bring them back the next year when the customers lookforward to it. But if we kept that on the menu, under the bridge operatingplatform, on an everyday basis, it would have, it would be a challenge. Wemonitor this closely through our operations metrics, and we are running betterrestaurants. We are faster; we have better accuracy, than we did last year,significantly more than we did three years ago. And that's the check in bounce.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question isfrom David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Thanks. On Europe,you mentioned the bridge operating platform. I was just wondering, just giventhe fact that I think you are going to be done the big three markets there,this quarter and the fourth quarter. Is that a big deal for '08? Is that a realbig enabler? And I guess, two more smaller questions. Could you update us onthe reimaging that's going in the UK? And where are you going withthat, and how far you are alone. And third, last is Russia. That's been such afantastic market for you guys, really great returns might be the best in theworld. Is there any chance that you can meaningfully accelerate your unitgrowth there and how might you think of that? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: Sounds like you've read The WallStreet Journal. First on BOP, getting completed on BOP, it will make a bigdifference in Europe in the big three markets.As I mentioned, some of the product promotions we've done, we literally cannot,we can't overlap them, in some cases we'd like that beef and chicken promotedat the same time, off the balance on the menu. But we can't, because wewouldn't execute it will. And so, it does open up the possibilities. Weinvested in our European Food Studio, we moved that to Munich, made a big investment and both peopleand facility in order to strengthen our future food pipeline. And so, we'vedone that in anticipation of being able to have BOP to be able to executeagainst it. So, I wouldn\u2019t say, I think '08 will be good, I think it willreally reap more benefit out of that towards the end of '08 and into '09, as weget through the testing of the products and get them out there.  Relative to the UK, we are going to do 130 reimages this year inthe UK,we just said it yesterday. And with the significant impact on our high streetlocations, they are not highest volume locations, but because it\u2019s all inside,obviously we don\u2019t have drive-thrus. And because of the amount of foot trappingthey are going far to those restaurants. There is significant brand implicationand we are seeing that traction.  So, we will do a comparablenumber next year. Actually, we may accelerate a little bit more next year inthe UK.Try to get close to 200, is what we think, we can execute well, within both thecapital budgets that we've allocated and just the contractors and our people.And so at that point, we'll start getting close, where you start gettingcritical mass, and the brand has a different look, and when we\u2019ve seen that inother countries, where it has been to US or France or Germany. We see our brandscores accelerate that gives us pricing flexibility and menu flexibility and sopretty encouraged by that. In Russia, we have great business withreally strong management. It's all [Paul McCockill] and when it looks like wecould grow faster, we are adding 30% to 40% to our business every year rightnow in number of restaurants and we got to grow all that management internally.And so, we will grow as fast as we can do restaurants well. And we've pushedthem, but we are not going to get ahead ourselves there. We have a strongpipeline of real estate, and it takes in some cases three years to get our realestate done there, especially for our drive-thru locations. But, right now we think the pacethat we have of 30% to 40% growth a year is a good number to be able to manageit from account point of view. Interesting enough is as we are growing at thatpace our comparable guest count growth in our existing restaurants and were newrestaurants are averaging at, both continue to go up. And so, the marketplaceis absorbing it very, very well and that's definitely encouragement.\nMatthew Paull: And when it comes to thefinancial picture in Russia,on a per restaurants basis it's the most profitable market we have in theworld. And when you look at our returns you are right, David, it is also thehighest returning market in the world. So, we are doing everything we can tomove our growth along in Russia.Thanks\nMary Kay Shaw: Next question is from GlenPetraglia at Citigroup\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: Good morning. Just as a quickfollow-up to that. I was hoping you could maybe comment on what sort of sales liftyou are getting in the UKwhen you remodel a restaurant?  And then just secondly, with thecommodity environment, and with labor environment as it is here in US, is thereany thought or is there any perceived need to maybe change the price point forthe Dollar Menu. I know, obviously, one of your competitors had done it coupleof years ago and was unhappy with the result. But, I was hoping you could maybecomment on that?\nRalph Alvarez: Okay. On the UK, above 5%. We are gettingslightly higher increase in our High Street locations, because it's allcustomers that are inside you walk by the restaurant and it's 5% in thedrive-thru location. So, we are very happy with the impact. You know that thebrand implications are even more important overtime. The Dollar Menu, we believe weneed to hold on Dollar Menu. It's really from a consumer point of view we havegreat equity, it's less than 14% of our sales. Some of our other competitorshad 25%, 28% of their sales on their value menu, they were much more dependenton it and had much higher impact to their markets from it. So, maintaining itis something we believe it's so important. We continue to test ouralternatives, not just in US, but around the world where, especially in moreinflationary places how to move off of a set price menu. But, for the timebeing we have the room in our business, we have a rich product pipeline, andfor the US for the next two to three years, and we believe having traffic inthe restaurants I get to see that pipeline is the winning combination.\nMatthew Paull: And Glen, from time-to-time weare opportunistic in hedging some of the commodity cost that go into making adouble cheeseburger, which is the number one item on the Dollar Menu. So, inmany years we will lock in those costs ahead of time, so we can tell ouroperators exactly what the food and paper costs will be. Also, we've been verysuccessful with the Snack Wrap, which has clearly taken some margin pressureoff the Dollar Menu.\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. Overtime, we've kept theDollar Menu, but we did move the majority of the US and we do this on a localmarket-by-market basis based on the needs of the consumers. But, when we firststarted it was medium fry and medium drink, in most cases now those are smallfry, small drink. And so, items like that actually have a big difference andbeing able to sustain it.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question isfrom Jason West at Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank: Yeah. Thanks everyone. You mentioned a couple of times challengingconsumer environment, first, I just want to clarify that's just the US that you arereferring to. And secondly, if could just talk about, have you seen any changerecently. We are seeing some pretty weak numbers in September from somecompetitors in the US.Have you seen any change recently in the US consumer environment? And thenin Europe kind of same question, I think stronger there relative to the US. And how youcompete the comps in Europe that have beenvery strong now for over a year?\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. In the US consumerconfidence is slightly down, but we have not seen an impact. You have seen thenumbers in our business. As we do mentioned, we did adjust some of ourmarketing and made sure we counteract what are perceptions out there. We dobelieve that today with our convenience play in the US were much more of the businessthat people need to have than it is bearable, but they can decide to have or notto have. So, destination, when you have destination of business it's adifferent standard. When you have much -- have a bigger piece of your businessbeing driven by convenience, you are part of people's everyday solutions. Andif we are the best value for that everyday solution, we believe we'll win. Andso, that's the piece in the Europe, the economy is strong in Europe. The only place where we had someimpact was in Germany,because of the VAT increase that they needed to do based on the rules of the EuropeanCommunity to balance their deficits and that had an impact on retail sales andwe felt some of that, even though we've managed pretty well through it thisyear. But, the rest of Europe, the economiesare strong.\nMatthew Paull: And regarding the challengingconsumer environment that was only a US based comment that we were making. Andone of the things that Ralph and I were talking about before the call was theimportance of the Dollar Menu in terms of the value perception our brandenjoys. When you go into a grocery store these days to buy the ingredients tomake a meal at home, I think most consumers have the impression that inflationis higher than the government is admitting. So, when those same consumers comeinto our restaurants and they see the Dollar Menu that's been there for four orfive years now, it gives us great pleasure for providing every day value. Also, I think, Jason, one of yourquestions had to do with, are we seeing any impact from the challengingconsumer environment, the higher gas prices? We have some stores of smallnumber in highway locations and in lower income neighborhoods and we intend tosee a little bit more reliance on the Dollar Menu in those stores. But, it's afairly small percentage of the USspace. Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Next question is fromAndrew Barish of Banc of America.\nAndrew Barish - Banc of America: Hi guys. Just taking into the US businesslittle bit more. Industry data in US I mean, traditional lunch, dinner has notbeen a robust day-part. In fact, maybe flat to down. Your commentary on the US sales, Ithink over the last year or so is really focused on kind of breakfast andnon-traditional day-parts. I mean, what do you attribute that to and are youconcerned about it continuing or is it really just kind of lifestyle changes ofAmericans, and that's kind of driving people in to the restaurants at differenthours than the traditional kind of lunch at noon and dinner at 6 'O clock.\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. I do think its lifetimechanges as a part of it. And we've adjusted, that's why you see us focusing onsome of the snack business, beverages its destination versus just complementaryto the sandwich purchase and increasing our product pipeline for breakfast. Butour lunch and dinner business is up also. And just breakfast is up more andlate night stuff more, but the other two are healthy both on sales and ontraffic. And, but there is no doubt when you do the cross section and look atthe all industry data that the higher growth is coming in the off hours andthere's a business to be have there and we are going to capitalize on it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question isfrom Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch\nMike Feng - Merrill Lynch: Good morning guys. It's actuallyMike Feng in for Rachael. Couple of questions first on BLAs. Could you talkabout, you have some language in outlook section at 8-K that says, the companywill continue to pursue the sale of certain existing markets to development oflicenses over the next several years. The original planned BLA converts werefor [200] stores which should leave roughly 600 by the end of '08. Is that'syour plan or do you plan to do more stores but over a longer period of time? Secondly, could you talk aboutthe kind of feedback you are getting from franchisees about the marginpressures and the pricing increases by competitors given that some QSRs arepicking much greater pricing? Thanks.\nMatthew Paull: Hi, Mike. This is Matt. I'll dealwith the development of licensing issue. The biggest transaction we needed toget done and we completed in this quarter which was Latin America. There are still quite a few markets on our list, but wewanted to give ourselves more time to do this the right way, to be sure themarket is in shape where we can get a decent surprise for any restaurants wemight license. And to be certain that we end up with a partner who believes inthe business, has a rather deep pocket and has patience and so a couple ofquarter ago we said, this will take us little bit more time to get it done theright way. But all those stores and countries are still on our list.\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. On those franchisees andmargin pressures, they're feeling. You see on couple of margins, reflection ofwhat the franchisees have in their P&L's, but the overall cash flow it'sstill up. Not at the rate, obviously that we had the last two or three years.And so it's a constant debate around, and it's one of the most important thingswe do to decide how do you price to the consumer, to still have traffic growth,but to grow margins and we are not here to debate. We have great usually, thisis only an art, kind of guess that it. Basedon your experiences, we've got a lot of science around this now, onsophisticated pricing tools, that let us know what happens, when you moveprices on one item, where the customers trade to, what's the impact on margin,what's the impact on traffic. And we have that data down for the individualrestaurant. And that's why we go into the market places, you will see every restaurantpriced differently and it's getting to that perfection on pricing. And so, that'swhat we use and we'll continue to manage it, but it's a long-term strategy, notmonthly or quarterly strategy.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. And the next questionis from John Ivankoe at JP Morgan\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan: Thank you very much. There haveobviously been some articles recently, not only about beverages but alsoMcDonald thinking about doing some new working of its drive-thrus in the US.Certainly, as lunch is obviously very busy and breakfast is very busy. Do youthink it's necessary to actually redesign, the physical plan at some point, topush through more capacity and is that something that may become a system-wideeffort in relatively near term?\nRalph Alavrez: First, I do think it's necessary.We are doing over 60% of our business through drive-thru, and the average iscloser to 65% for those restaurants that have drive-thrus. And in many cases,those booths are five foot wide and we've got a lot of products and thosecustomers who drive-thru are less forgiving on problems, because they can'tcome back to the counter and fix them. And so, we are very concerned with orderaccuracy issues, wrong orders are slowing down the drive in which in most caseshave a single point of ordering. And so, we are working through those pieces. Ihave read all the articles that are out there too. That's the reason we aredoing extensive testing. We are in 1500 restaurants with some form of thisbeverage initiative with different variations in the drive-thru, with 85% ofthose restaurants which has been franchisees, and we will get to the solution,but its investment not just a beverage strategy, its really, eventually its along-term investment no different than reimaging the dining room and thebusiness where its going.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question isfrom John Glass at CIBC.\nJohn Glass - CIBC: Thanks. In part of the answer youmay have answer this in part, but Ralph you mentioned you are compelled to continueto extend the coffee test. What are you waiting for? Is it just, is it thatbottleneck of the drive-thru and is it reasonable at this point to expect animpact from specialty coffees in '08?\n :\nRalph Alavrez: Hey John, those are all thepieces. We are literally in the middle of this, as you know we put in a very,four years ago, now rigid new product testing protocol where we go to differentmarkets, get diversity of geography, diversity of customer base and of the typeof restaurants we have, probably get effect in this area. We do believe that all theseissues have solutions. So, we are not hitting anything that you would sit thereand say the equipment can't keep up from a service point of view that wouldhave been the case with espresso machine equipment fours ago. Today, they candeliver at the speed and recovery rates that can make it happen. It's making sure that when we putthis in how it ties into our POS, what customers really want as an offering, weare not going to offer it, we get into this business that the breadth ofproducts that stockers offer but we have to offer enough of a breadth that youare destination point. And so what is that breadth, what's our pricing, thoseare the pieces that we are working through. We've got the product qualityconsumer acceptance piece figured out. And now it's the operational pricing howdoes it fit into our restaurants and what are the overall economics that comeout of it, that we are working on very closely with our franchisee body and wewon't go until we are ready to do it the right way.\nMatthew Paull: And John, in the United Statesalone it is a $60 billion market price. And if we can find a way to do this, ifthe speed, convenience and value you expect from McDonald then do it throughthe drive-thru is all different counter, we have a duty to our customers, ouroperators and our shareholders to pursue it. So we are going to look at it verycarefully. Thanks \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you the next question comesfrom Joe Buckley, Bear Stearns\nJoe Buckley - Bear Sterns: Thank you. First a follow-up toRalph, you mentioned 1500 restaurants that you are testing some form of beverages,and could you elaborate a little bit more on that, and talk about the differentthings that maybe in test there? And then a question for Matt on the commentson the commodity cycles, McDonald's always had a very unique supply system. Doyou foresee any changes in the way you source food, and elaborate a little bitmore on your comments, because I found them interesting, but I am not quitesure where you are headed?\nRalph Alvarez: John under 1300, but what we aretrying to do is get a variety of areas. So, espresso-based drinks havesignificantly different volume per capita today across the U.S. Obviously,number one would be Seattle, but when you go in to some of the middle America,it's a newer phenomena, newer meaning last three, four, five years. And so partof what we wanted to do is get a breadth of testing that allow us to understandboth, how consumers will use to the drinks, because they use it differently.Their knowledge of the variety you got to offer. And then the other pieces are ourbuildings. We have a lot of different building, a lot of different kitchenlayouts. And business comes at different rates and differentials. We want it ahigh volume, lunch driven businesses or breakfasts, and then be ableadvertised. So, you got to have enough scale in the market that you can get onTV, and put enough ads. And that's why the numbers 1300, it's between 1300 and1500, we are in some stage of roll out, build restaurants right now. And allmarkets don't have the same test, because if not it's just an early roll out.\nMatthew Paull: John well regarding my quickercomments on commodities, let me first start by passing on my sympathies on JoeTorre I know you are big Yankees fan. But back to commodities, what I wasreferring to is in the normal course of things, when the price on the commoditygoes up, supply reacts to produce more supply and the price adjusts. And we havenot seen that happening, in some areas of commodities. It's probably, becausesome of the government rules have just been created subsidies and eventuallythis will work its way out. But, while the markets are in the process ofworking things out, all we know is that our unique supply chain approach andour unique suppliers give us a competitive advantage that nobody else has inthe industry. So, we will get through it. We hope that government kind of stayout of all these. Let markets figure it out for themselves, but, we are veryconfident we will be able to manage through it. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Next question is from Paul Westraat Cowen.\nPaul Westra - Cowen: Great, thanks. There may be aquestion or two left. I think you mentioned the G&A savings. There was aquestion about on Latin America, I think youmade a mention to $25 million for this quarter. Is that a good run rate for theyear $100 million of ultimate savings, that you had a $160 million last year? Iwonder what you would expect that number to bend down to on an annual basis?\nMatthew Paull: Paul, when you look at Latin welicensed the market on August 1st. So, one third of the quarter we still hadthat G&A, two third we did not. So, you should not multiply that $25million number by four, because you come up short than what the number shouldbe. The guidance we've given in the past, that we continue to stand by is thatwe'll save about $125 million of the G&A in Latin America. We're still as an organization serving Latin America, still have some G&A, we'd expect their savings versusthat $160 million to be about a $125 million on an annualized basis. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from JeffOmohundro at Wachovia.\nJeff Omohundro - Wachovia: Thanks. Just the question aboutmarketing, as you look out into 2008 with the Olympics coming just wonderinghow you re integrating that into the plans, maybe just a general overview onthat? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: Sure. We've been out actuallylooking at plans for last two weeks. From a China point of view, we are makinga significant bet. We believe that we can leverage our involvement with theOlympics in a big way for our emerging business in China. And everything we are doingthere is all about allowing for our crew, our customer to access the Olympics, lureto be able to go to the Olympics. And we have some creative ways that we havedone with our crew is just selecting the best crew from each restaurant, and theyare ones who would work. We have four restaurants at the actual Olympics Village and they are the ones who haveto work at the village. And then, we have some customer type of programs thatwe are doing. The rest of our advertisingaround the Olympics in China, we will use to communicate in a way that webelieve that will make us more locally relevant and basically when China wins,you win type promotion that ties us to the Chinese Olympic game. In the rest of the world, we arejust putting different plans together. And it will be based on what they do andmake it look relevant. We do know its going to be one of the biggest Olympicsever, because viewership projections are high. And so, with Europejust presented us this week, and they have got some unique ways they are goingto leverage the Olympics. Mostly supporting core food, so it's not promotional,it's supporting core food, and using the Olympics to tell a story \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question isfrom Larry Miller at RBC \nLarry Miller - RBC: Yeah. Hi. Just had two quickfollow-ups. Matt, I think you guys are an AAA or A rated company. Are you guystargeting an optimal credit rating or an optimal credit structure? I mean howdo you how do think about that? And then secondly, may be you guys can talkabout this. It sounded like you reacted really quickly on a change in marketingas the consumer took a dip in September, how quick can you guys react in termsof changing your marketing plan?\nMatthew Paull: Larry, on the capital structureissues, when we went through the announcement we made in September, I'll justshare our thinking with you and hopefully that will address your question. Wewanted to try to find a way to reinforce that we believe in better not justfigure that it's working that we are going to be a company that relies more onfranchising and relies less on capital to grow. And we thought pumping thedividend and saying we are in a position to generate a lot of cash and we arechurning an awful lot of that to shareholders. We thought that's what we wantedto do. But we wanted to do it in a way that didn't financially weaken our systemas compared to our competition. We have the best franchisees in the world at McDonald's. One of the reasons is that they like our brand, we think there'smany. But one of them is that we are financially stronger than anybody else wecompete with. We wanted to maintain that difference between us and the rest ofthe competition. So, when we put together ouranalysis we weren't focusing on a specific credit rating. We were willing totake our rating down a little bit in fact one of the agencies did adjust usdown one notch. But we wanted to stay much stronger than our competition,because we want to have flexibility to deal with the opportunities that mightcome and I'll let Ralph deal with the marketing issue \nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. On the marketing issues,Larry, we can move pretty fast if it's a product. If it's a new product then wewon't, because we've learned that being disciplined on the rollout and thetraining at the restaurant level, and ensuring that we have that in place withsuch a distributing system. We can't move as fast, but if it's a product thatwe already have or if it's some other promotion, we can move pretty fast. Our operators, as you know ourmarketing fund is a separate entity that we all contribute into ourselves forour company restaurants and operators for theirs. So we have an empowered boardof operators that can make decisions very fast.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question isfrom Matt DiFrisco at Thomas Weisel\nJake Bartlett - Thomas Weisel: Hi this is Jake Bartlett in forMatt. I just had a quick question on drive-thrus in the UK. Could youtell us what percentage of the UKstores total system have drive-thrus?\nRalph Alvarez: It's between 50% and 60%. And it'swhere our growth has. The reality is that first 400 locations were all in linedup. And so, when we have 1,300 restaurants there, we still have the significantamount of high sweep, which is the way people shopped in the UK. But as thesociety there has changed, its more of the big box type retailers, we've movedour business that way. And as they move to having conceptions on highways, weare also doing that. So, you'll see that percentagegrow overtime to be more drive-thru. Interesting enough, it is our highestdrive-thru percent for those restaurants that have drive-thrus. So, we are at55% and growing and for those restaurants that have drive-thru, and whatpercentage comes to the drive-thru. So, the consumer uses it. We got to waitfor retail establishments to catch up and that's how we'll grow our business there.\nMary Kay Shaw: Looks like we have one finalquestion from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. First, Matt, thanksfor your thoughts on Joe Torre. I have got question on the international coffeeinitiatives and the McCafe's. We talk a lot about the US and what youare doing. But, what's going on in Europe and Asia,I guess primarily with coffee?\nRalph Alvarez: Yeah. Coffee is a big part of oneof our common success factors, but we are leveraging it different in different places.And we don't have one set formula. So, if you go from I would say the extremes asAustralia and Germany, wherewe have strong coffee cultures without any strong players, and we decided to bevery aggressive in our McCafe development. And to a certain extent we areputting McCafe's everywhere we have the ability to physically put in ourrestaurants. And have a full coffee experience, the whole gamut there, and bevery successful. So, Australiais pretty much there, Germanywill be at the 400 McCafe's by the end of this year and another 100 next year.And the rest of the world, we have some McCafe's also, but we are definitelyleveraging the coffee strategy starting with strong drip coffee first, PremiumRoast, and then various accessible, the different expresso-based drinks. With a high focus on conveniencein the USand in APMEA. So, the US'sconvenience is drive-thru. Our customers believe a product that we offer needsto be offered both in drive-thru and front counter in the US. It's acritical part of our brand. And in APMEA we do a lot of kiosk and on-the-go, especiallywe have high density, and so we are leveraging it there with convenience beinga very big driver.\nMary Kay Shaw : Thank you. We are out of time andquestions. So, I will turn it over to Ralph for few closing remarks.\nRalph Alvarez : Okay. In closing, we are pleasedwith our performance for the third quarter and believe we are on track toachieve a record year, both for our system and our shareholders. Although, weare proud of our recent business performance, I can assure you we will notallow success to make us complacent. Our management team is determinedto get even better in executing against our plan to win. We are in a greatbusiness with tons of opportunity, and we are confident in our ability tocontinue to deliver results by leveraging successful initiatives from onemarket, and replicating and scaling them to others ends of the world. Doing sowill enable us to deliver solid results for the remainder of the year, andaccelerate momentum in to 2008. Thank you, and have a great weekend.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation there will be a question and answer session for investors, (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me on our call today are Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner; and Chief Financial officer Matthew Paull. This conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. As always, the forward-looking statements which appear in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Both the earnings release and our 8-K with supplemental financial information are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I would turn it over to Jim Skinner\nJim Skinner: Thanks Mary Kay. Good morning everybody. Thanks for being on the call. As evident by our quarterly results, the fundamental strength and momentum of our global business in continues. Every area of the world is contributing with strong profit worldwide results. Matt\u2019s going to take you through the numbers in a few minutes. But what I want to talk about today is how we will continue to drive these trends. Let me start by saying, I am optimistic and confident, about our ability to capture the opportunity in the market place. Clearly our systems collective focus and alignment around the Plan to Win continues to be the right operational plant. Additionally, our ability to take up idea scale and execute it, this is our competitive advantage and a key driver of our growth. For example, we have adopted tiered menu platforms around the world; ensure learning in success since last quarters. The premium Chicken Selects, and value price Snack Wraps which are popular in the U.S. are now driving strong incremental sales in both Germany and the U.K., Breakfast and convenience are two more examples of our replicate skill and execute strategy. In Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa breakfast is now in more than 70% of our restaurants. The recent McGriddle breakfast sandwich launched in Japan is helping generate strong momentum. And the recently introduced western-style breakfast in China is driving breakfast count sales increases of about 50%. Extended hours are now in a third of our restaurants in APMEA. In China, half of our restaurants are running 24 hours operations and they are generating same store sales 6% of other national average. Together breakfast and extended hours are significant contributors to the double digit comp sales we are seeing in this area of the world. In the U.S., we are aggressively going after the $60 billion beverage industry with the focus on coffee. We added credibility in this arena now with lots of premium coffee last March. Today, premium coffee sales are up 20%. This credibility gave us brand elasticity to expand further into specialty beverages. Currently, we are testing a wider range of offerings including hot and cold drip coffee beverages an espresso-based coffee and ice beverages. We are encouraged by the preliminary results. Including these specialty offerings, total coffee sales are up more than 30%. Further operations and consumer testing will determine our timeline for a national rollout. And in line with our replicate scale execute strategy, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see these products in other international markets over time. One last example of this strategy and action is our global promotion of \u201cShrek the Third\u201d. The promotion began in May in the U.S. and launched at markets throughout Europe and APMEA in the summer. Today it has been hugely successful in driving Happy Meal sales, and we are confident the program will continue to drive sales such as it rolls out in additional international markets through October. Using our license characters to promote our food choice and variety while encouraging physical activity, has also positively positioned our brand with key stakeholders and consumers. Moving forward, we will continue to scan our system in the market place for what's working, scale it and deliver superior execution in our restaurants. Last month the top 35 leaders of our global business convened to review and calibrate our strategic approach in business plans for 2008 through 2010. These plans leverage our competitive advantages and focus our researchers around key growth platforms that would drive our business in every area of the world. Specifically, we are aligned around developing new branded food and beverage products and growing sales of existing products. Growing sales at our drive-thrus by expanding capacity and enhancing the customer experience, growing our business today product expansion by continuing to extend our build breakfast and fulfill new customer\u2019s needs in the organization, and we will continue to grow sales and profits through new platforms. I am confident these are the right plans to generate growth, and I am also confident in our leadership and their ability to execute in their market places and increase sales and profits. To lead and support these efforts, I would drive direction against a few critical areas. First is menu development, our track record over the last several years\u2019 shows success with salads, chicken and coffee, just to name a few.   No paragraph break   Yet we have an opportunity to enhance us towards some processes in food development, increase our speed to market and intensify impact. Next is restaurant re-investment, and ensuring the right place and level of reinvestment by balancing the needs of our customers, operators and children. We must optimize our projected $1.9 billion CapEx spend in 2007 and continue to deliver superior returns. Third is continuing our financial discipline with an eye towards growing our free cash flow. Initiatives to build sales and optimize margins are obvious contributors. Additionally, we are leveraging our strength as to franchise or with world class franchises to increase the reliability of our free cash flow growth. In the U.K. and Canada, we have made solid progress towards a goal of increasing franchise ownership to at least 70% of restaurants. And we will soon closing on the previously announced transaction in Latin America that we saw with the franchising of 1,600 restaurants to a developmental licensee. Both efforts demonstrate our commitment to improve consumer relevance to local ownership, wealth, and building corporate cash flow through a more stable rent and royalty system. And on the related topic, I want to briefly touch on our capital structure as I know it\u2019s of interest to you. We recognized the financial strength of our business is growing and getting stronger, at the same time we also know that credit markets are friendlier especially to a business model like ours. As such, we periodically discuss our capital structure and financial strategies with the Board to determine the amount and form of cash we should return to shareholders. As you know, we look at various alternatives and project their impact on the strength of the business, our credit ratings, our franchises and our suppliers. Currently, we are preparing to discuss these topics with the Board and are exploring all of our options   What I can reinforce is not new notes; we are still committed to return at least $5.7 billion to shareholders in 2007 and 2008. In closing, you\u2019ve heard say before that McDonald's is a learning organization, by giving you a peak out of the depth into our strategies and areas of opportunity going forward. I hope it\u2019s clear that while we are pleased with our current business performance, we are not satisfied with the status quo. We are focused on and committed to developing and executing the strategies that will provide sustained profitable growth for our system and shareholders. Thank you and now turn over it over to Matt.\nMatthew Paull: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. As Jim just outlined today\u2019s real news is the underlying strength and momentum at global business. These transitions of virtually all in our Latin America business to a developmental license, positions us to further leverage this momentum. For our customers it will help us become even more convenient and more locally relevant. For our shareholders it will reduce volatility and contribute to improved returns as a result of having a less capital intensive business model with a substantial, reliable and growing royalty strength. As indicated in April the approval of the Latin America transaction resulted in a second quarter impairment charge. The substantially non-cash impact of $1.31 per share is comprised of $1.33 per share of impairment expense which includes about $830 million for the difference between the net food value of the business. And $700 million in expected cash proceeds. It also includes $780 million in accumulated currency translation losses. This was apparently offset $0.02 benefit because we stopped depreciating these assets in mid-April in accordance with the accounting rules on assets held for sale. Including the total net impact of $1.31 we reported a second quarter loss per share of $0.60. Excluding this, second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.71, up 27% from last year. As per our tax rates, after adjusting for the impairment charge and a minimal tax benefit from our Latin America transaction the effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.2% bringing our year-to-date rate to 32.4%. We are currently in the midst of our IRS tax audits and therefore are unable to provide full year guidance until its resolution. Now turning to our ongoing operations, we achieved strong earnings growth on record revenues of more than $6 billion in the quarter up 8% in constant currencies, total margin dollars from McDonalds restaurant, grew 12% in constant currencies to about $2 billion. About one third of these margin dollars were generated by company operated restaurants. As a percent of sales , McDonald margins were strong up some 150 basis point to 17.6%, this increase was primarily driven by improvement in Europe and Asia Pacific. In Europe, sustained strong sales growth throughout the segment contributed to margins rising 200 basis points, the U.K. and France were the main drivers of these increase. European beef and chicken cost were relatively flat in the quarter, which is also our outlook for the full year in Europe. Broad based improvement in Asia Pacific drove a 220 basis points margin increase. China was clearly a leader here with strong comparable sales growth fueled by breakfast, extended hours and a relevant menu featuring premium core and value offerings. While for maintaining its focus on the customer, the U.S. achieved strong margin levels at 19.5% despite in an inflationary commodity and labor cost environment in the quarter. Chicken, which is up 9% in the quarter and dairy were the main commodity cost pressures we experienced, while beef cost declined nearly 3%. For the year in the U.S. we continue to expect beef cost to be flat to slightly down, while chicken is to be up 4 to 5%. While the U.S. business navigates through the current cost environment, its priorities will continue to be offering great value, driving customer traffic and delivering strong margin performance. I also want to point out the 200 basis points of the improvement in Latin America margins was driven by double digit comp sales growth in Brazil, Argentina and other markets, while the elimination of depreciation contributed 300 basis points. The other two thirds of the $2 billion in total margin dollars is from our rent and royalties stream, less occupancy expenses due to the franchising side of our business. As a percentage of revenues, franchise margins increased 50 basis points to 81.5%. Franchise margin dollars are a steady and reliable driver of our free cash flow. We expect free cash flow will continue to grow as we evolve to a more properly franchised less capital-intensive structure. Our Latin America transaction represents more than two thirds of the restaurants we targeted for conversion to a deal structure. This single transaction results in the percentage of franchise restaurants world wide increasing to 77% from 74% at year-end 2006. As for the remaining market on our list are currently thinking. It may take a year or two longer than originally contemplated. Throughout this process our goal has been to make sure that we have the right license fee. If the market is in good condition for transfer and that we optimize the long-term profitability and reliability of our cash flow. Our teams in the UK and Canada are making good progress towards our goal of having more than 70% of the restaurants in the East markets franchise. In the UK, the percentage of franchise restaurants increased from 37% at year end \u201905 to 47% today. We are on track to have 50% over UK restaurant franchise by the end of this year and 55% by the end of next year. In Canada, we have increased our franchise percentage to 66% and are well on our way to meeting or exceeding the 70% threshold. These efforts will enhance the continued growth and reliability of our free cash flow, the primary source of the cash that we return to shareholders. Year-to-date through June, we repurchased nearly 36 million shares for $1.7 billion as a part of our previously communicated commitments to return at least $5.7 billion to shareholder in \u201907 and \u201908. Our priority remains to create long-term profitable growth for all stakeholders, by sharpening our systems alignment around and focus on our customers in our restaurant we are confident we can continue to deliver strong results. Now, on a much more personal note I want to share some of my plans with all of you. When I accepted this job more than 6 years ago, there were certain things, I wanted to help this company accomplish. Gratefully through the hard work of the people who comprised the McDonald system, we have made very good progress. The company and the McDonald three-legged stool are at least strong today as at any time in he last two decades. When Jim became CEO in 2004, we discussed then, that I expected to work for three or four more years. Well that time is almost up and I want all of you know that I plan to retire in the near future. I have spent a significant portion of my time in this job investing with all of you in the investment community. And I have enjoyed every minute of our interaction. It is important to me that you understand why I am retiring from McDonald. This is not about me wanting a bigger job at McDonald\u2019s. I have a wonderful job and this company and this CEO have been extraordinarily good to me. This is not about me going to work for some other company it is all about what I want out of my life. I have always dreamed of going back to a college campus to teach and because of all that McDonald\u2019s has done for me, I can now afford to do so. When Jim and I discuss this, we decided we wanted to be very transparent regarding the search for my replacement. We have some very strong internal candidates, who will also be interview and external candidates in the next few months. We expect that it will take at least several months to identify the best and effect a smooth transition. So in all likelihood, you have to put up with me at least until the end of the year. Now, I know that Jam want in to comment. Jam.\nJim Skinner: Well, thank you, Matt. And I truly mean that, thank you. You continue to make a remarkable contribution to our business. You helped us turn this business around. Thanks to our emphasis on operations excellence and marketing leadership, and of course financial discipline. Our system and our shareholders owe you huge debt of credit to you for your commitment, your passion. You helped us be better, not just bigger and now as you announce your decision to pursue a life long dream, you leave McDonald on business high in a position of continued success. We forth for continued success and I know, and saying obviously when I say that Matt, (inaudible) from his financial expertise is owed to you and his vast experience. There are lots of benefits in the left tangible qualities; I know that I certainly have. Matt is a great listener, a deep thinker, a strong communicator and has been a great thought partner to me. As it pertains to his future role, quite frankly, we have all benefited from Matt\u2019s privilege for years. And so, it\u2019s with obviously mixed emotions that applaud Matthew decision as we mentioned Matt makes his announcement with several top candidates for inside and outside the McDonald system. We will take our time that\u2019s needed to find and transition his successor. Matt\u2019s has also made it clear he will be available to us beyond his official retirement date, while I hope that won\u2019t be necessary. Certainly, considering his intellectual capital that he brings to the table he has offered certainly, as we assured. Before I close my comment about Matt, I would like to emphasize the fact that McDonald management team remains in lined our plan to win, we will continue to stay course and remain as committed to the financial discipline that has helped us turn our company around. Matt you are a great executive. You are retiring with class and dignity. You are a great friend and I wish you and Ilene the best with the next chapter of your life. And again thank you for your many contributions to the McDonald\u2019s system.\nMatthew Paull: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Thanks. I will now open up the call for questions. (Operators Instructions). The first question is from Joe Buckley from Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. I wanted to ask you a question on margins both on the U.S. side and the European side. First on the U.S. margins, second quarter narrowed despite pretty good same store sales increases, the margins been down a little bit year-over-year. We've basically seen peak levels in the U.S. And then with respect to Europe, curious if you could sort of layout for us going back several years ago that sort of the goals on margins, whether European segments fits in to that? Where you think you are in terms of the margin recovery process? And before I get cut off; Matt wish you the very best on your retirement from McDonald\u2019s.\nMatthew Paull: Hi Joe, thanks very much. I will comment on U.S. margins and then get to Europe. On U.S. margins, we have said for quite sometime to maintain our margin percentage in the U.S. we need a 2.5 or 3 point comp. And in the cost environment we see right now in the U.S. obviously that was not enough because we produced a 5 point comp and we did not further grow margins. I don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that we have peaked. We are, in my view, in an aberrational cost environment to give you some idea. The cost increases that we're seeing and the effect they have I think you will agree that it is, it is not norm. So just some examples, you all know that our beef and chicken sales are about at equal levels in the U.S. these days, a 5% movement in the price of beef or chicken cost of 20 basis points. So if chicken was up 9% and beef is down 3 that\u2019s hurt us a bit. In addition, cheese was up 14% in the quarter and a 5% movement in the cost of cheese cost us 15 basis points, but on top of that because of minimum wages used in the states which started hitting in the third and fourth quarters of last year, we've seen labor cost increases are almost a 100 basis point at the store level. So with all that as background obviously a 5% comp was not enough in this particular cost environment, but we view this as being an aberrational constant environment and the brand has pricing power. We raised menu prices roughly 3%, we were able to do that while keeping guest counts growing. And we don\u2019t think that we peaked but we think that given the cost increases we're seeing this year, it may be for the year we peaked. But in future years, I'm very confident U.S. margins could go higher. And 19.5 is a nice number, if we ended up settling at that number for a year, I could easily live with that.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you,\nMatthew Paull: And I want to get to the European issue. Europe thought it was a really nice number, 18% is a good number. But when you look at the phase above it, Russia and France are very strong. UK still have their ways to go, we've seen improvement there but about half of the improvement we've got in the UK came from the re-franchising and we know that the UK is still very far away from where it was a few years ago. We're not ready to set new goals. We still have not reached the overall global goal that we set three or four years ago, which is to get back to an annual global company operated margin of 16.9. We\u2019ll see where we are when we may close this year we might be there, and if we get there, then we will talk it over and then obviously set new goals. Thanks John.\nOperator: The next question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Hi congratulations Matt, on a great career. Sometimes you tell us what the company margin gains in Asia were due to China, and how much the gains in Europe or it is, the U.K. You are kind of touching on it there a little bit. Could you perhaps give those numbers if they are handy, or if there is any way to add some texture to the margin gains in Q2? And just one more small one that is, with regard to the cash back to share holders and the leverage question that people inevitably have, are we are going to get into a bigger discussion in that, only in the fall at your big meeting in November? Thanks\nMatthew Paull: I will deal with the Europe issue and you want to talk about\u2026\nJim Skinner: David, good morning\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Good morning, Jim.\nJim Skinner: The basis point improvement in China was 400 basis points, and we are very delighted with where we find ourselves in China right now. We are growing new stores more profitably and really driving the growth there to the leadership that we have in the market place. We are actually looking at our resources there and the infrastructure and our opening levels to see whether we can ramp that up overtime and pick up the pace, because the story continues to get stronger. But and the headline is that we have got to be able to make sure that we get the right locations and the right operating excellence to deliver relevance for our consumers. That\u2019s the number one goal, and we are in it for a long term, but we are very pleased to find ourselves and we had substantial profit increase in the market.\nMatthew Paull: And just, David, Europe about 75 basis points or so of the improvement in Europe\u2019s margin. 75 of the 200 came from the U.K. and about half of that was from re-franchising, about half of the 75, that\u2019s gives you a perspective there. Just trying to go back to China for a second, we\u2019re particularly proud of the marginal performance in China and the operating income improvement, because as I am sure you\u2019ve read there are commodity cost pressures in China which are significant, and in spite of that we had a substantial increase in our margins in China. And I think the last part of your question had to do with the timing of when we talk about cash being returned to share holders. It is as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, a Board matter and we don\u2019t want to recruit our Boards ability to weigh in our midst not only as to what we are going to do with the timing. So our normal timing is sometime in the fall recovery, and they are peeping into that. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question from Jason Ralph at Deutsche Bank\nJason Ralph - Deutsche Bank: Yeah, thanks a lot. First, if we can talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the comps in the U.S. and Europe in terms of ticket versus traffic, are you seeing any, I guess in the U.S. more importantly any response, when your prices up, any changes in terms of the mix on the menu here people making towards the dollar menu, et cetera.\nMatthew Paull: Jason, this is Matt, I\u2019ll take that. And globally what we\u2019ve seen for the quarter is and this is true on almost every area expect maybe Asia, we stand between 50% and 60% of the sales growth coming from guest counts, between 50% and 60% in just about every area of the world for the quarter. Asia with somewhere between 70% and 80% coming from guest counts. And in terms of recent trends, we have seen a little bit more movement in the U.S. towards guest counts that is still again for the quarter, the U.S. was right around 60% of the sales growth was from guest counts. And we had a very healthy relationship. We have seen, maybe a little bit more of movement in the direction of our Snack Wraps. The Dollar Menu in the U.S. has trended at almost the exact same percentage, somewhere, between 12% and 15% for the last three or four years. It's never gone outside of that range. We are seeing a little bit more uptake on the Snack Wraps and those are the trends we are seeing today. And some of that maybe influenced by gasoline prices and disposal incomes. And we are very much like the balance we have between gas comp growth and sales growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Glass, CIBC.\nJohn Glass \u2013 CIBC: Hi, thanks, good morning. You talked in your comments about optimizing CapEx over the next couple of years and historically it looks you\u2019ve spent about half on maintenance and then half on growth and it seems like the maintenance components of it, whether it\u2019s the U.S. tree model or the fact that you are selling Latin America, if you don\u2019t have that, isn\u2019t going to be there going forward. So, my question is are we going to enter a period here, we believe that capital expenditures could flatten out or even decline versus prior years or does inflation and things like other growth initiatives offset that reduction in the maintenance. If in fact that\u2019s what we are going to see?\nJim Skinner: Well, John, I can just comment on that and Matt may want to weigh in, but we've been spending of our 55% of the CapEx on reimaging in the portfolio. It still has a ways to go before we reach the reimaging of the entire portfolio. So I don\u2019t expect that balance to change a lot over the near-term and the remainder, of course, was on new openings and then rebuilds and remodels. And so, I think the balance will stay about the same and it\u2019s possible we could have a slight reduction, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it is in the strategy. And then, John, your reference to inflation is one of the factors that's clearly helping our results, but also effect CapEx. The EURO is off late it's a $38 and some change this morning, and that has an effect. So, if you were to index this for inflation of our currencies, I think we\u2019d expect CapEx to be flat, but because those inflation and especially because of currency values in Europe I would expect it to go up.\nOperator: Thanks. Next question is from Jeff Bernstein, Lehman Brothers.\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thank you very much. Just in terms of the company operated of course follow on to prior questions. We did some modest pressure on the food and paper line after each three quarters of leverage? Even with the talk of the significant pressure on commodities, we are surprised not to see greater pressure on that particular line item. I just wondered if you could talk about the operating structure and your ability to protect margins in the current environment and then just kind of a follow on to that, as you look up to 08, should we expect greater pressures as you renegotiate annual contracts or your protective based on your supply of ingredients agreements, I should say. Thanks.\nJim Skinner: I will make a kind of -- we have very good supply chain. Around the world we tend not to take shortcuts. We have a lot of dedicated suppliers who understand how important it is to protect the brand name and do things the right way. Having said all of that we do have some opportunities that might not be available to everybody, a good example in the U.S. with chicken. If you look, I think we said chicken costs were up in the quarter 9% for the year. We think they are going to be up 4% or 5%. And out of the way we get there is we are using a lot of white meat from the bird in the U.S. and we have been exporting the dark meat and the value of dark meat in Asia is higher than it\u2019s ever been. And so we get a lot of credit in our cost structure for the fact that we are selling the dark meat to Asia. And if you look all around the world you will see that our people on our supply chains are very creative, at finding ways without sacrificing food safety to keep cost down. So in China with very significant increases in chicken prices, we managed to keep the food and paper percentage at a reasonable level. And regarding \u201808, we generally don\u2019t hedge more than a year ahead and the biggest single hedge that we've probably make is on beef, where we tend to hedge about 25% of our beef cost and a part of the reason we do that is so that we can go to our franchises and say we're protecting the food and paper cost on the double cheese burger and its important to keep it on the dollar menu. But we never go beyond a year and probably beef is the single biggest hedge that we make.\nOperator: Next question is from Paul Westra.\nPaul Westra - Cowen & Co.: Hi good morning and a this is for you Matt as well. I have sort of a follow-up question on your capital structure, I guess just straight out of it. Is it safe to assume that you are no longer officially expected to maintain your current capital structure, they noticed into this mornings 8K that language was removed from the K. I think it was in the first quarter and there were comments of the context in the board. So are we just waiting sort of then find out how much with respect to potentially lever in one.\nMatthew Paull: Paul, thanks for the question. I think my comments were really meant to say that we're not weighted to our capital structure right at the month, we never have that but we do review it with the board, it\u2019s a relationship that we have with the board in the decision making their own capital structure that we review every year. And as I said we're taking a close look at it right at the moment and we expect that any of those decision were made and of course time will go on the next few months and normally it happens around September, and the expectation is that any decision we have made about that time.\nPaul Westra - Cowen & Co.: Okay. Thank you\nOperator: Next question is from Jeff Burns at Citigroup.\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: This is actually Glen Petraglia from Citigroup, Thanks, in terms of our yield additions I think if I looked at my past date case correctly you\u2019ve lowered your net unit addition expectations for this year a bit, maybe if you could talk about what\u2019s driven that and I think some of the things that have been I had seen in the past that suggested that perhaps you would be rather sitting up. Your unit growth whether it be U.S. or internationally and I\u2019m a bit surprised to see your planned edition this year down a little bit.\nMatthew Paull: Glenn what that is all about is really what\u2019s happening in one country. In Japan, they had about a hundred almost all satellites meaning very small stores, so they decided to close. That was not in the plans coming into the year, so there\u2019s nothing to do with the gross additions. It has to do with the fact that our closings of some very small units, very low volumes came up recently and that\u2019s what explained this 100 unit adjustments.\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: Okay if I get this chance \u2013.\nMatthew Paull: Sorry about that.\nOperator: Oh yeah I guess you get cut off. But we\u2019ll put you in the queue again. The next question is from Jeff Omohundro, Wachovia.\nJeff Omohundro - Wachovia.: Thanks. Just a quick update please on the POS system rollout, and if you\u2019re still seeing, what are actually improvements that were previously discussed?\nMatthew Paull: The POS system rollout were up to about 10,000 stores globally, but very little has touched the U.S. at this point, its 100 or 200. And the order accuracy improvements that we discussed were what we say in a laboratory setting. We have not measured it yet in the stores we've rolled it out but we are very confident that its makings the crew\u2019s job easier and if it makes the crew\u2019s job easier there is a very good chance that we are doing a better job with our effort here. Overall mystery-shop scores are better around the world by a fairly significant amount but we still know we have a long way to improve.\nOperator: Our next question is from Victoria Hart at Merrill Lynch.\nVictoria Hart - Merrill Lynch: I am calling in for Rachel Rachael. I just want a follow up on your previous comments on the CapEx plans in which although re-franchising has taken ways, I\u2019ll expect that some CapEx would fall out. Can you kind of guide us a little bit better as to what you would expect there more normalized rate or in the re-franchising, the out structure complete and then a little bit more on the re-imaging if 55% of the CapEx is on reimaging, where does our profit stand, which markets are benefiting from re-imaging and how much longer it would take to complete the process?\nMatthew Paull: Victoria, we\u2019ll give you a point of view here. I would say that the normalized rate is about where we are now and that it\u2019s true that we are probably doing away with the need to invest $90 or $100 million a year in Latin America, because of the dealing of that market. We\u2019ve taken up the number of rebuilds for planning in the United States. The rebuild is where you have a piece of real estate, you like the location, but you need a completely new building. So we are doing almost 300 rebuilds this year, versus 200 last year, and our expectation is that we are going to continue rebuilding the store base and when it comes to re-imaging, I believe that the model we are evolving towards is to touch the system once every ten years in terms of remodeling. We haven\u2019t committed to that firmly, but I don\u2019t think we are going to reach a point of time where we are done, because when we reach that point of time it might be time to start on the stores we began with. So we are thinking this through, we think maybe once every ten years, about 10% of the system per year might be the right answer. For this year we are only targeting to do 1,900 or so remodels, and it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll bring that number up per year to closer to 10% of the system and every market in the world benefits where they have mature restaurants, they need to re-image. And so, it sort of spread across the globe and you look at Europe and United States in particular relative to the re-imaging dollars. And this is an issue we study very carefully. It's very hard to connect exactly, what\u2019s happening in the business to re-imaging, but we think it's very important part of brand relevance. And we think it has distinguished us from competitors in the eyes of our customers. And lastly, just one factor and that I'm sure most of you aware. When we look at in the last 20 years and probably up until the mid 90s, we were spending in excess of 20% of system wide sales on the company's CapEx that ignores what the operators were spending in CapEx. And now you are look at where we are trending, we\u2019re running between 7% and 8.5% of system wide sales, is what we are spending on CapEx. So, we have made a big adjustment. None of us are trying to tell you that $1.9 billion is a small number, but relative to system wide sales, it's much smaller than several and the number I gave you really isn\u2019t on system wide sales, it's really on revenues. But if you look, if you track our revenues and CapEx as a percentage of those revenues, you see it's going down dramatically over the last few years. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Wiltamuth at Morgan Stanley.\nMark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. Question for Matt. I am sure you watched all the securitization franchises happening at the other restaurants?\nMatthew Paull: We sure have.\nMark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: I am curious, if that could that play a role for you or is that just not an avenue that investment great companies head down? And as you are looking at the international markets are there any restrictions or difficulties in securitizing in international franchises?\nMatthew Paull: Mark, I\u2019m going to answer the first part of your question and I think that will deal with the second part. We have looked at it, and we have concluded it makes the most sense when you got a company that is not investment grade and if the are borrowing cost and flexibility issue. So if we were to do something in the area that Jim described, I do not expect currently that it would be in the form of securitization. And since we have given you that answer, it doesn\u2019t make sense to say about what it will look like globally. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Steven Kron, Goldman Sachs\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. Matt, congratulations, best of all Q. Question on pricing, just follow up on that. Matt you mentioned a pricing of 3%. Can you just put some context around how that compares to maybe what you guys had priced in the past and any thoughts going forward, particularly given, it seems though you guys have been able to maintain the type of mix on the menu and product mix that you had hoped for. So it seems to be a little push back on the priceing. Might we see that go higher? And if I were to slip one more in there, can you just maybe Matt also comment on the remaining of your stores that are delayed, a little bit beyond your expectations? Is this just a question of not finding the right individual or are you having a difficult time getting that evaluated, you guys think should get out of that?\nMatthew Paull: Steve, if I get started up on the pricing in United States, it\u2019s very consistent with what we do typically year-to-year depending on where inflation might absorb in the economic environment overhead. This year at 3% it\u2019s very consistent with our pricing models and as we look at, we don\u2019t typically simply take whatever cost issues are in front of us and pass it through the menu. And we have a very well robust menu pricing process that leaves us with proper conclusion regarding maintaining that value relationship with our customers in the pricing and so some of that off course is reflected in terms of the cost, but most of it is really about maintaining the relationship of their customers and allow them to understand the value you experience at McDonalds and continue to visit. And we're not releasing a lot of pushback I think on that pricing, you said that. I don\u2019t know that we really seeing any pushback prospect on that 3% pricing. Relating to guest counts, actually guest counts are up a little bit.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: And then Steven, on the DL issue just a little background, the biggest block of restaurants that were targeted as the DLs. We are about to close on in Latin America. We've learned a lot as a result of this transaction and one of the things that we've learned is we don\u2019t want to put ourselves under too much time-pressure, if we intend to do it right and believe me we intend to do it right and specially to select a right licensee. Having said all of that, I do want to point out, that if you look at the last page of the supplemental release and this doesn\u2019t even yet reflect what we're about to do in Latin America, you'll notice that year-to-year we're up 564 franchise restaurant and down 203 company owned restaurants, so even without the effects of Latin America, we're making progress, some of that was dealing of other markets. Its not that was re-franchising some existing we can't goes without using DL and again from perspective the remaining markets in our list carry a combined book value in the neighborhood of 500 million and we said as recently a couple of quarter ago, we expect to receive about half of that proceeds from what is left on the list is not really significant. Thanks\nOperator: Next question is from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan: Thanks. A question for you, I guess Jim and it\u2019s a follow-up to your comments you said that you alluded to on China in your prepared remarks. Year-over-year look like you\u2019ve opened about 50 stores and in this current quarter you opened about ten, obviously comp sales done good margins are good and you mention that you wish that you could open stores quicker then you\u2019ve been. Is there anything that is changing in the relatively near term to allow Trans store development to accelerate from recent levels?\nMatthew Paull: Well, there is nothing specific at the moment or it was in the fact that as I said one of the things we did in our planning meeting in May was to take a look at the revenue generators and what they would research properly as a company to drive the growth over the long term. And certainly, openings of new restaurants in those markets that we have targeted with the great returns we are getting and the great opportunities here in China was one of those. And so we are looking at that right now. We have another couple of sessions coming up with the top 12 people in the organization, just to take a look at how we will resource to really drive the revenues that you saw of course into long term growth. Openings in China is one of them, we are planning a hundred a year now, and the question is whether not we could ramp that up substantially, particularly on a base of 800 restaurants, which for us at Mc Donald\u2019s is a fairly substantial growth in itself. The most important thing is quality, profitable sites that we are bringing on, numbers don\u2019t matter if they are not quality profitable, new unit sales growth. And then whether the infrastructure, the organization can drive the operations excellence in those restaurants because it takes people to get that done. We have to develop the real estate properly then you have to operate these restaurants, it\u2019s not about just getting promoted. And so whether our staffing is appropriate whether we have enough research and that we think we do currently. But the question is whether we could ramp it up some of the future and we are looking at that right now.\nOperator: Thank you the next question is from Virginia Chambliss from JP Morgan.\nVirginia Chambliss - JP Morgan: Thanks. I had a follow up question to the discussion on evaluating the capital structure, I am just curious if you can give us any guidance on how much lower in your credit rating you might be comfortable in going. Thanks.\nMatthew Paull: You know Virginia, we\u2019ve said publicly that we know we can run the company well if it\u2019s something other than an A rating, but we are going to wait until we\u2019ve discussed this with our board before we comment. But I think we can safely say we are not talking about anything below investment rates.\nOperator: Thank you, the next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Thomas Weisel.\nMatt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel: Thanks. In respect to the comments that you have talked about on the Snack Wrap and premium roast coffee in the U.S. helping. Should we also assume then, that you saw most of your or there is a shift to greater sales distribution to pre-noon hours in the breakfast time, I am sorry can you hear me?\nMatthew Paull: I didn\u2019t hear the last piece of that\nMatt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel: Well I was curious on the breakfast mix as a percentage of over all sales, in particular in the U.S. market and given that premium roasted coffee and the Snack Wrap seem to be successful and conducive to pre-noon hours, I am just curious if you are seeing, the distribution of your U.S. sales shift more and what they stand right now as far as breakfast, lunch and dinner?\nJim Skinner: They really haven\u2019t shifted much as an overall percentage just because of the size of the numbers first of all, some movement as Matt said to the Snack Wrap but on an overall basis the breakfast business continues to grow at about the same rate and the rest of the date wise the percentage breakdown is about the same, including the extended hours, which the extended hours really on an overall basis and not adding a lot to this same store sales growth and yet it\u2019s incremental. And so I think the percentage has remained about the same.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Joe Buckley.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. Soon as we go back to the developmental licensing because the 8-K outlook section did you indicate that there might be some deals this year but Matt it sounds like you were pushing expectations on that out of it.\nMatthew Paull: Yeah Joe, if we left that impression. We didn't mean to adjust anything, except to say whatever it is we had in mind, it might take a little longer. So, we weren\u2019t trying to imply that we think we are going to get something done this year.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Other than the closing of the existing deal.\nMatthew Paull: Other than the closing of the existing deal.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from David Palmer.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Hi guys. Could you perhaps go over the timing and rollout of the new kitchens in Europe? And perhaps, give us some color of as to what that might mean in terms of enabling more innovation, better innovation, anything with regard to the cost that just overall what it might mean for Europe? Thanks.\nMatthew Paull: Right now David, I think the number in Europe is around 1,600 restaurants here. The bridge operating platform which as you know facilitates the opportunity between products that are go direct and those products that are prepared in advance. It simplifies the operations, improves quality enhanced with the work environment. And about 50% of the European restaurants have Pub or rollout pub by the bridge operating platform by the end of \u201907. And we expect that the majority of restaurants in Europe will have it by the end of \u201909. And it does give us the flexibility to do things as I mentioned in the advert side of the business and create more flexibility.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Glass, CIBC.\nJohn Glass - CIBC: Hi, thanks. This quarter Burger King pushed into late at night for the first time nationally and also did some value promotion to breakfast or value menu breakfast, did you feel an impact from either one of those businesses, either in absolute or maybe in a kind of mix shift or ticket shift as a result of it?\nMatthew Paull: No.\nJohn Glass - CIBC: Okay. Thank you.\nMatthew Paull: Thanks John.\nOperator: It looks like we are out of questions, so I will turn it back to Jim who has a few closing comment.\nJim Skinner: Well, thank you guys for being on the call. In closing I just want to reiterate what I said at the beginning of this call that our business is strong and we are looking to future with one goal in mind building in our momentum. We will continue to leverage our competitive advantages namely our ability to scan our system for what's working, replicate the initiatives and scale them around the world for maximum consumer and business management. Coming off our 2008, 2010 plan review I can say with the utmost confidence that our people and our plans are aligned around the right consumer initiatives to create growth into the future. And we remain committed to the financial discipline that supports our growth strategy of being better and not just bigger, and it will enable us to continue to deliver sustained profitable growth for our system and shareholders.

I will begin with comments on the quarter\u2019s results and then discuss this morning\u2019s announcement regarding our developmental license strategy. Our first quarter results were very strong and I am pleased with the momentum the execution of our Plan to Win is driving across all geographies. Our system is aligned and focused on one plan to create an even more successful future, and we are confident that being better, not just bigger, is the right strategy. Although we are proud of our recent business performance, make no mistake that our management team knows there is much more we can and will do to sustain and grow the business in \u201907 and beyond. Now for the quarter. We delivered earnings per share of $0.62, up 27% over prior year earnings of $0.49 per share. Separately, if you compared our earnings from continuing operations, they were up 38% over last year\u2019s $0.45 per share. Revenues increased 7% in constant currencies, driven by our strong comparable sales growth. Operating income for the quarter reached almost $1.2 billion, up 25% in constant currencies. Reflected in these results is a benefit of 11 points from impairment charges we took in the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive margin expansion. As a result of healthy sales growth and a good balance between traffic and average check increases, company-operated margins increased 120 basis points and our franchise margins increased by 30 basis points. I will now provide the details by area of the world, and we will start with Europe. Europe had an excellent quarter with comparable sales up 8%. We are pleased by the sustained momentum we have achieved. Company-operated margins also improved 180 basis points to 15.4%, driven primarily by the very strong comparable sales. The U.K. contributes 75 of those basis points of the margin improvement due to positive comp sales and last year\u2019s strategic closing of restaurants and ownership changes. During the quarter, beef costs in Europe increased by 2% while chicken decreased about 2%. We expect beef and chicken costs to be relatively flat for the year. Results in Europe are being achieved with a focus on three core strategies: upgrading the customer experience, building brand transparency, and enhancing our local relevance. Related to upgrading the customer experience, McDonald's Europe continues to attract customers by featuring a variety of premium products along with compelling value options. These, mixed with exciting marketing promotions, are driving the results. Talking about menu offerings, the U.K. launched Chicken Selects and Snack Wraps, and their early results are reflected in the March sales. Germany will be next to launch these menu items. Beyond the big three countries of France, Germany and the U.K., we are also seeing strong consistent performance elsewhere, including Russia and Italy, markets with significant upside for growth and they will contribute much more in the next three years. Now, turning to the U.S., our momentum continues with first quarter comp sales up 4.4%. We are seeing success from breakfast, extended hours, and the menu line extension of the popular snack wraps with February\u2019s launch of the grilled and honey-mustard versions. We will continue to keep the menu fresh for our customers with this week\u2019s rollout of our premium Southwest Salad. Company-operated margins for the first quarter remained high at 18% but declined 30 basis points versus last year. This is primarily due to state minimum wage increases and group health costs. Regarding commodity costs, beef was down 5% for the quarter while chicken was up 6%. For the year, we expect beef costs to be down slightly and chicken to be up in that 5% to 7% range. In total, we believe 2007 cost pressures can be managed by our continued business momentum, along with reasonable menu prices, increases which will be spread out throughout the year. Our U.S. breakfast business continues to grow and has never been stronger. In 2007, you will continue to see an emphasis on breakfast with new product introductions like Cinna-melts, now available in most of our restaurants, and our coffee customization. In addition, we have tests of a bigger breakfast burrito and a southern style chicken biscuit. We have also built a strong foundation in our brewed coffee business with last year\u2019s introduction of the premium roast coffee. The success of our efforts now enables us to further expand in the coffee space by adding ice coffee in many markets and then later down the road, specialty coffees like cappuccinos, lattes, and mochas. Our U.S. business has a strong plan in place and the best owner-operators in the industry executing against that plan. In fact, during our recent U.S. owner-operator annual business meetings, Jim Skinner and I were very impressed by the energy and alignment and the commitment to continue to grow the brand. Now, turning to our Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa area of the world, in Asia-Pacific, the comps for the quarter were up 8.5%, led by Japan, China, and the Middle East. Asia-Pacific\u2019s focus on branded affordability, breakfast, combined with convenience extensions like 24-hour drive-thru and delivery are producing results. This segment generated a 260 basis point improvement in company-operated margins to 14.9%, primarily driven by the strong sales. We have compelling, locally relevant plans in each of the countries and we are doing a good job executing against those plans. For example, in China our management team is having success delivering on what we said we would do -- focusing on branded affordability, more choice on the menu, and expanded convenience. We are beginning to see traction. In fact, in the first quarter, China revenues increased 15.9% in constant currencies, company-operated margins were up 380 basis points, and our operating income grew by 73.5%. McDonald's China is actively promoting the variety of proteins we offer -- chicken, beef, and fish. This unique-to-McDonald's consumer proposition, when coupled with creative advertising, distinguishes us from the other quick service restaurants there. With increased spending power and a 15% growth in automobiles comes a greater mobility and demand for convenience. The McDonald's drive-thru becomes an ideal choice. Our development plans for 2007 include opening 100 new restaurants, half of which will be drive-thrus. New restaurant drive-thru restaurant sales are higher than those restaurants that open without drive-thrus. In addition, we opened the first drive-thru as part of our Sinopec alliance this year and we expect to open 10 more by the end of the year. Sinopec is China\u2019s largest petroleum retailer with 30,000 locations, providing us with an important pipeline of sites for the future. We are very optimistic about our prospects in China. Our business is strong around the world. We remain committed to continuing to increase customer relevance and are confident in our ability to continue to deliver results. Now, let me shift focus and discuss strategic activities around maximizing our asset base and our ownership structures. Franchising remains a backbone of our business, a recognized business model that helps build and make our brand what it is today. In fact, more than 70% of our restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by entrepreneurs. We remain committed to our long-term strategy to have McDonald's restaurants mostly run by strong independent business women and men who are dedicated to grow in the markets they operate. While it is important to maintain a certain number of company-operated restaurants to test new concepts, develop talent, and to remain a credible franchisor, our goal has been to reduce the overall percentage over time. As part of this process, we announced today a significant transaction under our development licensee strategy, or DL. We have committed to franchise nearly 1600 restaurants in Latin America to a single developmental license organization led by Woods Staton. Woods is a highly respected businessman and leader and a valued member of the McDonald's system for more than 20 years. He most recently served as south Latin America Division President. In that role, he worked closely with McDonald's Latin America President, Jose Armario, and the leadership team to help revitalize our business. In fact, many key leaders there were recruited and developed by Woods and are expected to remain a part of his team. Woods possesses strong operations and marketing skills to continue the growth of the brand, make effective reinvestment choices, and maximize the potential for this geography. Woods is committed to a long-term relationship and will be the CEO. His other partners include Capital International Private Equity Fund, [Galvaia Investimentos], and DLJ South American Partners. All are prominent groups in Latin America with many years of business experience. Ultimately, this selection was based on the best overall package of price and terms acceptable to McDonald's as well as Woods and his team\u2019s expertise and experience in the marketplace. Their strength provides additional assurance that our Latin American business will continue to exemplify the highest qualities of our brand. We want to express our appreciation and the enormous respect we have for our Latin American franchisees, partners, and employees who have worked hard to achieve a great business turnaround. Despite external economic challenges, the recovery is well underway. Our brand is extremely popular and we remain confident in its long-term potential. In fact, for the past three years, McDonald's Latin America has achieved double-digit comp sales gains, driving improvement in both company-operated and franchise margins. First quarter 2007 marks the 13th consecutive quarter of company-operated margin improvements. We hope this perspective gives you additional insight into the current health of the business and our confidence that the momentum will continue under Woods\u2019 leadership and result in success for all three legs of the McDonald's stool. It is important to emphasize that this ownership approach is one we have used for many years as we have over 1,000 restaurants currently operating as DLs around the world. It is a structure similar to a traditional franchise arrangement. A local entrepreneur uses their capital, real estate and business knowledge to build the brand and optimize results. Now, in terms of McDonald's commitment to building long-term value for our investors, we believe our actions speak louder than words. You can count on this leadership team to continue to act in the best interests of both the shareholders and the system. I would now like to turn it over to Matthew Paull who will provide more details on the transaction, our quarterly results, and our impact that we have had.\nMatthew Paull: Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Our intense focus on providing solutions for today\u2019s busy consumer is driving sustained business momentum. We are leveraging this momentum with disciplined practices to enhance long-term shareholder value. Today, I would like to highlight some of these activities, in particular, the progress we have made on our development license strategy. In 2006, we outlined our intent to franchise about 2300 restaurants with developmental licensees over a three-year period. This morning\u2019s announcement of the franchising of virtually all of McDonald's Latin America under a developmental license marks a milestone in pursuit of our goal. When we close the Latin American transaction and complete the conversion of these restaurants, the McDonald's brand will be better positioned from both a customer and a shareholder perspective. The customer will see us growing faster and becoming even more locally relevant. Our shareholders will see a less capital intensive business with reduced volatility, a steadily growing stream of royalties, and improved returns. On our last call, we made reference to getting even better at being better and not just bigger. One of you on the call asked us to describe just what we meant by that. Well, this transaction is an example of just this. We expect to franchise almost 1600 mostly McOpCo restaurants to Woods Staton and his organization when the transaction closes some time in the next few months. The benefits of licensing substantially all of our Latin American markets to this one group is the increased opportunity for the long-term success of the licensee. Owning an portfolio of markets balances the risk, so that if one market experiences volatility it is likely to be mitigated by the success of other markets. Now let\u2019s get into some of the details. With the approval of this transaction earlier this week by our Board of Directors, we crossed the threshold to account for these restaurants as held for sale for impairment testing purposes. As such, in the second quarter, we can now write down the assets to their estimated realizable value. Cash proceeds from the transaction are expected to be about $700 million. In line with previous guidance, the expected proceeds represent slightly less than half of the $1.5 billion net book value of the assets in these markets. This results in a substantially all non-cash second quarter impairment charge of approximately $800 million. Our non-cash second quarter impairment charge will also include about $825 million to recognize accumulated currency translation losses, losses currently carried in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet. Moving forward under this arrangement, we will collect the royalties starting at 5% of sales and escalating after 10 years. Woods Staton and his partners have committed to invest about $100 million annually to reimage existing restaurants and to open new restaurants, and McDonald's overall G&A will decline in excess of $125 million as our licensee assumes responsibility for most of the activities we previously funded in Latin America. Based on 2006 results for these restaurants, the anticipated annualized impact of this transaction is a decrease in revenues of about $1.5 billion; increased franchise and company-operated margin percentages; no significant initial impact on operating income as the incremental net royalty income will approximately the operating income earned in the segment in 2006; in addition, CapEx requirements will be reduced by about $90 million; and finally, we anticipate the benefits of this structure in Latin America will improve our consolidated return on assets by about 90 basis points. You may have noticed that we did not include guidance this morning for our full year tax rate in the filing we made this morning. We expect a minimal tax benefit from the Latin America transaction and we are nearing the end of an IRS tax audit which could impact the tax rate. Once we have resolution of these items, we will update our guidance. This Latin American transaction, combined with other markets franchise to developmental licensees in 2006 results in about 600 restaurants remaining in the DL pipeline. These mostly McOpCo restaurants represent less than $500 million in net book value. We continue to expect completion of these conversions by the end of 2008. We believe today\u2019s development licensing announcement is a positive for our customers, our shareholders, and our system and is another step in the direction of moving to a more franchise business model. Woods and his team will optimize the McDonald's brand and experience better than we could and faster. This relationship gives us an opportunity to participate in Latin America\u2019s considerable growth potential via a more stable, more investor friendly royalty stream. The growth and stability of our licensing strategy also supports our commitment to return more cash to shareholders. We will use the $700 million in proceeds from this transaction to increase cash returned to shareholders. We now expect to return at least $5.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in \u201907 and \u201908 combined. In the first quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion, or 22.4 million shares of our stock, so we are off to a good start on this commitment. Going forward, we remain committed to further reducing shares outstanding through buy-backs and disciplined compensation mix practices. This disciplined approach also extends to our G&A. In the first quarter, G&A increased 4%, about one-third of the quarter\u2019s revenue growth rate. For the year, we expect G&A as a percent of revenues to decline, continuing a four-year trend. In closing, I am pleased with our strong first quarter results and with the significant progress we have made in franchising more of our restaurants. The Latin America transaction is one more step in the process and will reduce our worldwide McOpCo percentage from 26% to 23%. I echo Ralph\u2019s confidence in Woods\u2019 team and believe that these strategic actions further solidify our commitment to continue to enhance shareholder value. Thank you and now I would like to turn things back over to Mary Kay.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Matt. I will now open the call up for questions. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Glen Petraglia.\nGlen Petraglia - Citigroup: Good morning. Ralph, I was hoping you could just repeat your comment about the U.S. margins being down in the first quarter and what your expectations are going forward regarding pricing. My understanding was that wage pressures would have -- the plan was to be able to price the wage increases throughout the states. I am curious to know why that was not the case in the first quarter.\nRalph Alvarez: Margins were down 30 basis points, yes. They were at 18%, which is close to our all-time high. Remember, this is the winter quarter. It is not when we normally take many of our price increases. We spread them out throughout the year but not at the time when customers are tighter in the wallets. So we are comfortable that throughout the year, that both the minimum wage increases, some of the group health costs, and the commodity costs are reasonable and that our business momentum will, along with the fact that we have brand strength and we have price elasticity, that we will cover that throughout the year, but this was not unexpected for us.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question comes from Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets: I wanted to ask a question on the U.S. breakfast. A lot of competitors coming in over the next 12 months, and clearly McDonald's has the biggest share. Could you guys talk about how you think about defending market share and defending margins, the balance between those two things? Thank you.\nRalph Alvarez: Larry, first on the margins side, breakfast has very strong margins. Our growth in coffee has only made those stronger, and it is not an area that we do much discounting. The growth is exceeding demand. Demand is exceeding supply here and so we continue to grow breakfast comps higher than our regular menu. We have a strong pipeline of new products, and so what we have done is we have accelerated the amount of media that we spend against this segment in order to be able to communicate the new products and the pipelines that we have and make sure that we stay top of mind. We believe breakfast will continue. Breakfast away from home grew 10% last year, and so -- not for us, that is for the category, so we are very bullish on it and not concerned about the competition coming in.\nMatthew Paull: Larry, just some perspective, I think meals eaten outside the home for breakfast is at about 11% in the United States. For lunch, it is probably in the mid- to high-20s. For dinner, it is also much, much higher. As Ralph mentioned, it is growing very quickly. If we only hold on to our share of that growth, we are going to do very well. We think we will do better than that. Remember that this is a habit developed over a long period of time. People have been jumping in and out of breakfast for some time. We would agree these days because they see what we see. There happen to be more people jumping in but that has been going on for many months now and we have been doing just fine, but we will take nothing for granted.\nRalph Alvarez: One last item there is that I always say, we have been making real estate decisions for the last 30 years with breakfast side of the road being a key component of that. I would not underestimate the value of convenience. As you know, when people are going to work, they will not make a left-hand turn and get out of the traffic pattern.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Good morning. Congratulations on that quarter. A question for you on Europe and the operations changes that you are making there. The kitchen changes, the bridge operating platform, you put that out in the U.K. recently. Could you talk about how you might be phasing that in throughout Europe and what sort of schedule we can think about that? Was that an expense lately -- as you deploy that, is that something that we should consider on the margin line? Lastly, if there are other things like credit cards and other point of sale systems that we should be thinking about, particularly in Europe? Thanks very much.\nRalph Alvarez: The bridge operating platform -- we will be mostly complete with rolling out bridge operating platform by 2008 throughout the major countries of Europe. So it is not just the U.K. We are very far along in France and in Germany and this is a critical component to allow us to extend our chicken strategy and continue some of the menu momentum. That is why you are now seeing the Chicken Selects and those types of products, because we are able to handle them at a much higher level of quality and a more varied menu. As far as margins, they are not significant investments and so not an impact on margins. You saw the level of margins we had first quarter. It is more the reason we have not done it faster is the operational take and the retraining that needs to occur on how we call production and how we schedule labor, and so we have been very careful on doing that. Relative to credit cards, in general in Europe, the majority of our business is debit card, not credit card. That is what is a big part of it. In most markets other than the U.K., we already have been taking cash less for a long, long time. The U.K. is something that because of the equivalent of POS systems and where we were, we were not able to do that and that is going to happen here over the next year.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Jim Baker at Neuburger.\nJim Baker - Neuburger: I had a couple of quick ones. One on China. Can you give us some sense as to what percentage of the Asia profit growth might have been just attributable to the turnaround you are seeing in China? That was my first question. Secondly, I noticed in Canada you had no revenue growth to speak of but a lot of profit growth, a lot of margin improvement, so if you could talk about that. Finally, to which geography was the impairment charge of $2.6 million in \u201907 attributed to?\nRalph Alvarez: First on China, I can tell you relative to the margins, the company operated margins, of the 270 basis points, China was 100 of those basis points improvement. They improved 380 on their base but that represented 100 basis points to the Asia Pacific area of the world improvement. Relative to Canada, Canada sales were just slightly up on a comp sales basis. We were not satisfied with that. We could say weather and everything else but the reality is we were not, but we have stabilized our Canadian business, our branded affordability, and our margins have been growing there so that is why you saw decent margins. We also had a few gains from some of the refranchising that we are doing there of company restaurants that are part of our operating results but are not necessarily going to be a recurring gain that continues going forward to the long term. We just rolled out Snack Wraps in Canada and we have a strong plan so we believe their plan is solid for the rest of the year.\nMatthew Paull: Jim, that impairment of $2.6 million, that is Maldova. And then, just one other thing, to give you a perspective on Asia, the most profitable two markets are Australia and Japan, in that order. Gaining quickly on them is China, so China would be number three in Asia.\nMary Kay Shaw: As we said earlier, we would like to pause for a moment of silence for the victims of Virginia Tech at this time. Okay, we can go ahead with the next question now. Thank you for that. The next question is from John Glass at CIBC.\nJohn Glass - CIBC: One clarification, and then a question. The clarification is on the remaining 600 DL units, if you could just talk about their sales and profit contribution. My question, Matthew, is for you I guess on leverage. Can you remind us on the rationale of why 35% to 40% debt-to-capital is the right level? I guess in particular I am interested if your thinking has changed on that as others in the restaurant space, particularly the quick service space, have used leverage more recently and more aggressively to increase returns. Has that changed the way you look at leverage? Thanks.\nMatthew Paull: Thanks, John. Mary Kay will, when I am done answering the leverage question, she will update you on the remaining 600 restaurants in our DL pipeline. We get a lot of questions about our capital structure. I want to give you some background. We review our capital structure with our board at least once a year. I think you are all aware that we have about another, depending on how you would measure it, $7 billion to $10 billion of debt that the rating agencies add back to our balance sheet due to leases. You have seen us be very serious and committed to reducing share count and returning large amounts of cash to shareholders. With that in mind, each year in our outlook we try to give you an idea of what will happen with debt levels. I think we have targeted 35% to 40%, a simple debt-to-cap ratio. We are probably running much closer to the 35% than the 40%, so even within the guidance we gave you, which is not written in stone, we have given ourselves five points of flexibility. That is probably a little over $1 billion. We look at how we want to run our system. We do consider the effect it would have on our suppliers and franchisees, and then we give you some guidance as to how much we expect to return to shareholders at a minimum over a period of time. I think you have seen that every time we have put out a minimum, we have exceeded it. And that is we are fully aware that we are evolving our business model in a direction where we are going to be less capital intense and more money will be finding its way into the pockets of our shareholders. What we would like to reserve is the flexibility to say exactly what form it will take, dividend or share repurchase, and exactly which year. Anybody who has invested in the stock, and we welcome everybody, but anybody who has invested in the stock thinking that in a month there is going to be some big leverage events, it is just not likely to happen but it is something we look at regularly. We certainly understand we could run our system with something less than a stable A credit rating, but for now that is what we are targeting. Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: To update you on the 600 restaurants, they are primarily located in Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa, and some small markets in Europe. They have a net book value of less than $500 million. These 600 restaurants in 2006 had sales of about $800 million, had an operating loss of about $10 million, but that was before impairment charges of about $30 million; G&A of about $45 million; and CapEx of about $25 million.\nMatthew Paull: John, I want to come back to one last item relating to the leverage issue. We are not people who think like we have all the answers. We monitor trends very carefully. We have certainly watched what has happened at Domino\u2019s. It seems to have worked nicely for them but it is a different company, different brand, a different set of franchisees than we have. Just because it worked for one company in our industry does not necessarily mean that we would do it. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Scott Carroll at Goldman Sachs.\nScott Carroll - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Just along those lines, maybe you could talk about the dividend. It looks like the payout ratio is about 37.5% or so on consensus \u201907 earnings. I am just wondering if maybe you could frame where you might like that payout ratio to go over time.\nMatthew Paull: Thanks, Scott. We do not target a particular payout ratio. However, I want to make it clear that we love dividends. Before it became popular, we made a significant move with our dividend, and for those of you who were not following us back then, we said it reinforces -- paying a larger dividend reinforces our overall strategy of better, not just bigger. We had this history of opening a lot of units as the only way of growing. When we decided to transition to better, not bigger, we wanted the way we use our capital to reinforce our strategy. So we went to a bigger dividend. Our Board meets once a year, usually in the fall, to consider the dividends and I would expect that would happen again this year. But other than signaling how much total cash at a minimum we expect to return to shareholders over the next two years, we are not in a position to talk about a specific dividend recommendation today. Thank you.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman Brothers.\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Actually, a question on your long-term growth targets you established a few years ago, specifically related to system sales and revenues, profits, returns. Obviously the past few years have been very strong on all measures. I am just wondering if that out-performance you can sustain over the next few years. I guess this is directed more towards Matt then. The serving of an increase perhaps in those long-term targets, or whether you see those as appropriate in the near term. Separately, what you see as more your normalized, long-term EPS growth. I am just wondering whether high-single digits you would view as appropriate as you look out over the next few years or whether you think the momentum can continue above that. Thanks.\nMatthew Paull: Jeff, thanks for your question. We learned three or four years ago that we are better at running a business than at predicting what the business will do. So we picked targets that we though were healthy for our system. We have been fortunate enough to exceed them every year. I expect that we can continue to exceed them but by exactly how much, we don\u2019t want to say. We know that focusing on the 32,000 locations we have today has been very, very healthy for us. We fully understand that in places like Russia and China it is bigger and better, but for a lot of the rest of the world, it is better, not just bigger. So we are going to stick to the strategy we have. We are not going to predict what our long-term growth rate would be other than to say we are going to stick with these targets and we expect to continue to exceed them. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. I just wanted to go back to Europe, if I could, a couple of questions there. First on the sales line, can you just talk to us about the make-up of price mix and traffic in the 8% comp and how that might compare to the trends you were seeing a year ago, if there are any changes? Secondly and related, if I think about the source of the margin gains there, if you bucketed them into kind of the mix of product versus the absence of discounting or just leveraging the fixed costs, can you give us some color as to how you think that margin expansion, that 180 basis points shook out?\nRalph Alvarez: First in Europe, Europe is an area -- you know, stable inflation, so our price increases which we normally try to keep right at or slightly below inflation, is something that as far as in the sales, you can pretty much count on those being in that 2% to 3% range. Now, what we have had when you look at that 8% comp, is we have had some very successful new products that are priced at higher than our average products. If you look at our results, it is a healthy blend of traffic, price increases, some were below 3% but we have had a little bit of an average check growth also from the new products. As far as the margin growth, the biggest factor was sales but a stable, branded affordability, especially in the U.K. where we were doing a lot more discounting before and had not established a solid consumer strong everyday value, is helping margins. We already had that in Germany. We have had it for the last almost two years and we have a pretty good base also in France. So in our big markets, that is where we are at so I would tell you it is mostly sales, some definitely with the branded affordability, and we had a slight benefit in the U.K. as we mentioned earlier from the store closings and the refranchisings.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Andy Barish at Banc of America.\nAndy Barish - Banc of America Securities: Just quickly following up that and the U.K. assets, can you give us an update, any significant actions early this year or what you are expecting for the remainder of \u201907?\nRalph Alvarez: Not anything of significance in the first quarter. We did have -- I think we had 12 refranchisings and we closed a few, like five or six restaurants. We do have leases that come up and if it is not in our best situation to go ahead and renew those, we get out of some of those. We continue to be committed to get below that 30%. We have said that that will be at a pace, and I will tell you that pace is more in that 50 store range, because we need our franchisees to be healthy both from a capital and a management and training point of view to be able to absorb the restaurants as we transfer those over. We have a franchising plan. We have worked with them. Our best franchisees are the ones that are going to grow. They are developing that talent and they are putting themselves in an economic situation to be able to do it and we are executing against that plan.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Could we talk a little bit about your CapEx? I know you guys have been doing a great job with the refranchising and I think the remodels, at least interior remodels are complete in the U.S. Could you talk a little bit about the remodel program within the context of -- I guess your forecast is for CapEx to be up again in \u201907 versus \u201906 and versus \u201905? At what point should we expect you guys to begin to trail off in your capital expenditures?\nMatthew Paull: They have been trending up a little bit but I have to mention that the Euro itself has been going up so fast that if you did this on a constant currency basis, it would not look like much of an increase. I think that when you look at the opportunities we have around the world, the only thing that I could see changing significantly for us is that you heard Ralph describe how excited we are about our progress in China. Well, if we decided to open 200 restaurants a year instead of 100 in China, it would only take maybe another $50 million of capital, so it is not going to be a significant factor or a significant change. We signaled this morning that as a result of this licensing transaction, the CapEx requirements which used to be ours will transition to the licensee over the course of this year. It depends when we close the transaction. So some piece of it, $90 million, won\u2019t be our responsibility this year and none of it will be next year. I might point out that the licensee is going to grow units probably at a rate that is twice as fast as we have grown them in the last three or four years, but that will not be our capital. I would say you ought to expect our CapEx to run in about the same range, and please remember when the Euro is up, it not only raises our operating income but some of our CapEx requirements go up because we are also investing in Euros in some of these markets. Thanks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Matt DiFrisco at Thomas Weisel Partners.\nMatt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners: Matthew, could you just update us as far as is there a franchise mix goal that you are looking for in the more mature Western European countries right now, where you stand and where you look to go to on a desired basis?\nMatthew Paull: We have signaled pretty clearly that we believe in franchising. We kind of invented the category as applied to the restaurant industry. We have to admit we got distracted over a period of years and in some of the major western markets, we ended up with a company-owned percentage that was higher than we thought made sense. So we have signaled, for instance, in Canada and the U.K., that our long-term goal is to have no more than 30% McOpCo in each of those countries. We have looked at all of the other countries. France is way below that. The U.S. is way below that. Australia might be very slightly above that, and then there are several other large markets where franchising is not available to us because local law does not allow it or our rights as a franchisor and landlord are not enforceable. So we believe in franchising. We are going to continue to reduce the company-owned percentage, but other than the U.K. and Canada we have not set a firm target.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe at JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan: Thanks. Obviously in the U.S. you have a few major market tests going on of what I think are some pretty exciting premium products, the Southern Chicken Sandwich in Dallas that we have seen and of course the one-third pound Angus burger on the West Coast. Could you help us understand how those products are doing in individual markets? And assuming that it is going well, when they might be ready for national rollout?\nRalph Alvarez: We do not signal how well they are doing but if we are mentioning them to you on this call, in general obviously we believe they have the ability to be scaled. We have not talked about the Angus burger test. In southern Cal it\u2019s got a lot of press. It is early. We started that in the first quarter but we know that there is a market out there. What we have said is our greatest success is when we give our customers what they are already getting in the marketplace that we have not offered them, and if we can deliver those at McDonald's price and McDonald's speed. So if you look at in general the type of products that we are testing, they are products that are already in the marketplace, already have consumer appeal. What we have to figure out is can we deliver them within our operating system? Also, does the customer believe that brand McDonald's has credibility in order to sell those? That is where we are at but we believe we have a strong pipeline here for the next three years.\nMatthew Paull: John, I want to reinforce what Ralph just said. We used to have two issues. One was can we do it operationally and will the customer accept it from McDonald's? On that latter issue, we have discovered that we have a lot more freedom of movement from a customer\u2019s point of view because of the way the brand has evolved, and we are very, very positive about that. You look at what is in the test that Ralph named, we have the Southern Style Chicken, Angus Burger, specialty coffees, iced coffees, all premium priced products and customers -- it is still early -- customers have told us this make sense at McDonald's. That does not mean every one of these test will become national but the reception on the part of the customer and what our brand stands for has never been stronger and so we are very excited about all the things that are in test and all of the possibilities.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. I just want to go back to U.S. margins for a moment. The labor pressure, you mentioned minimum wage increases and a couple of other things, but is it also related to raises that you may have given independently, changes in schedules, or even some of the extended hours and the labor percentages you might run in those extended hours?\nRalph Alvarez: We give out increases on a regular basis. They are based on both seniority and levels of training achieved in the restaurants and so those do not necessarily happen in one month, and we do that on purpose so that they are spread out. We had 22 states raise minimum wage, have minimum wage increases here in the last few months, so this piled on a little bit more one-time. Normally it is something that is spread out and then they match how we also move our prices and thus it is more predictable on a month-to-month basis. We made the decision not to mess with our price value equation just because we had a slightly higher bump. Our productivity on a per transaction basis, which is how we measure it, including our extended hours is strong and has not declined, so it is not because of that.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Howard Penny at Prudential.\nHoward Penny - Prudential: Thanks very much. I guess technically my question was asked, but I want to try to frame it a different way. The pendulum has swung dramatically from the low points in \u201902, \u201903 to where the rating agencies were breathing down your necks to improve profitability, and now the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that yes, you have sort of mentioned before what your target is for debt-to-cap and you are giving $5.7 billion to shareholders in the next few years, you gave $5 billion in \u201906. It almost seems like you are significantly under-levered today and the $5.7 billion, while it is a huge number, it is grossly low to what you could really give, especially given what you did last year, what your cash flow looks like, what your CapEx is. If you could maybe just go through how you come up with the $5.7 billion. I understand you have the $700 million additional increase to that with the assets, but given the development, the license strategy and you are moving towards a more franchise system with more stable royalties and all that, can you maybe go into why 5.7 is the right number and why it should not be 10 or $15 billion even?\nMatthew Paull: I want to reemphasize -- we keep saying at least and we have a pretty good history of exceeding our minimums. So I do not want you to fixate on 5.7. That is the minimum. What we do -- and I agree that the landscape is changing in the capital markets generally but also, we have a more stable business model that I agree would support more debt if we decide that is where we want to go. What we do is we go through an internal analysis that we certainly are not going to share on the call. We have our own view of what that borrowing would do for the stock price and we look at that and we look at okay, what does it mean to our system that we are financially strong. And we weigh those things every year once a year, and again, this is not in cement, but for now it is where we are and for now that outlook is what it is until we decide to change it. I am not guaranteeing you that next year we will say 35 to 40 is right. It could be something different but for now that is where we are. I think by the time we end the year, you will be happy with what we have returned to shareholders. I certainly agree that we could run this system and run it well at something less than a stable A rating. But for now, that is where we are.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Paul Westra at SG Cowen.\nPaul Westra - Cowen & Co.: Thank you and good afternoon. I have a question going back to the transaction with Woods. I think I\u2019ve got it but I want a little clarity. You mentioned the 1600 units. I just want to be clear -- those are 1,100 plus company and inclusive of 500 or so franchise units. Is that the case and if so, walk us through the -- I guess the new development licensee would be the master franchise -- you know, development licensee with franchisees underneath them. How would those contracts change or anything change from the local franchisee perspective?\nRalph Alvarez: You are right. We have over 1,100 McOpCos there so those transfer and are company-owned restaurants of Woods and his company. The franchisees become franchisees of that new company, and so the contracts that are in place transfer to Woods. The responsibility for servicing those restaurants transfer along. In fact, we have had conversations with our franchisees in Latin America. Over the last few months, I personally -- Jose Amario and I have been out in the marketplace as the word of potentially doing a deal has been out there. We had a conference call before this but we had a webcast where Woods and Jose addressed the different issues. We are confident on the serviceability, the capital strength of Woods and his investment group and their commitment to growth. From our point of view, it is a master franchisee is what -- he is a master franchisee for those other franchises. We will provide the brand, guidance, support and sharing of best practices from around the world is what our responsibility will be to that area of the world.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: I\u2019m sorry, I may have missed it, but can you give us the breakdown of the consolidated company-operated margins with labor and occupancy for the quarter? It is usually in the 8-K.\nMary Kay Shaw: I did not hear the question.\nRalph Alvarez: The breakdown of food and labor.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, food was 33.3%, labor was 26.2%, and occupancy and other was 24.6%. Was that your question? I guess we were anticipating that question. Thank you. The next one is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Just a follow-up to that, Mary Kay, those are worldwide numbers, I assume? Would the U.S. numbers be available?\nMary Kay Shaw: No. Nice try, though.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Two questions, if I can. One, Matt, on your comments, you talked about or made reference to your debt ratings and how they affect the franchisees and suppliers. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, if they are really affected and how so? And then, a follow-up question on the SG&A. It as very, very well-controlled in this quarter. Should we expect that to continue or was there anything unusual in that year-over-year comparison that will make the SG&A grow a little bit more, even though less revenues in following quarters?\nMatthew Paull: I will take the question about how our credit rating does or does not affect our franchisees. I would say it has a couple of effects. Our franchisees admittedly are very strong compared to the rest of the industry. Their equity compared to debt levels is extremely healthy and getting healthier year by year. But still, we believe that they enjoy a bit of a halo from the strength of our brand. Not that we provide any guarantees, but our banking system and the banks that participate in our lending programs we think make credit available more inexpensively because of our financial strength. In addition, you know what franchisees pay other franchisors in terms of fees, and we get a very generous franchise fee payment from our U.S. franchisees, for example. The same thing for our franchisees all over the world. If you got them collectively in a room, they would say one of the things they get from McDonald's is our financial strength. If we decided to take a downgrade of a couple of notches to make a big return of cash to shareholders, one of the things we would examine is okay, what does it do to that relationship? Does it change the expectations of our franchisees? Will they come to us and say maybe we should not pay you as much because you are not giving us the halo from your financial strength anymore? We do not know all the answers to all those questions, but that is some of what we think about.\nRalph Alvarez: On the SG&A, Joe, the rate that you saw for the first quarter is a fairly normal rate of growth. We have tight controls on G&A. It is one of the commitments that we made to our shareholders. There will be savings in excess of $125 million a year from the Latin America transaction that will come off of that once that transaction closes. So that will be a benefit towards later on in the year.\nMatthew Paull: Just one other comment on G&A, so the 4% we talked about was an as-reported number. If you did it in constant currency, it was 1.6% or 1.7%. And then because Europe had a really good quarter, they accrued some incentive compensation. It was probably above their 100% target, and so that is in there as well. If you factored that out, it would be below a 1% growth.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets: Just two questions; can you update us on where the U.S. and European business stand in terms of reimaging? How many stores have been done and what kind of sales increases you guys are seeing and plans to get the rest done timing wise? Also, just in terms of U.S. average unit volumes, I think they are roughly around $2 million. Can you give us an idea of where the variance is around there? Is it pretty tight around that $2 million range, or do you have some laggard in the group that could really catch up to that volume? Thanks.\nMatthew Paull: The reimagings done through the end of \u201906, about 4,500 U.S., about 1,100 Europe. There are still some more being done but the formal program in the U.S. stopped at the end of \u201906. That does not mean we will not find things where we choose to co-invest with our franchisees in the U.S. That is always a possibility. We really like what the reimaging program did and there are several effects, not all of which we can measure. One is the that we reimage has a sales lift and that varies all over the place, but a second effect is the employees and operators who work in that store get a lot more excited, and the third effect is reimaging a significant percentage of our base of stores to bring them into this century sends a strong message about our brand. Ralph talked about all the premium products that are in test. You cannot sell a premium product in a dining room that looks like it has not been touched for 20 years and we are fully aware of that. This is one of the ways we tap into our competitive financial strength as a franchisor and also among our franchisees. We know the rest of the industry cannot match what we are doing in this area but we are going to be very careful. We have generally been touching something just under 10% of the store base per year. I do not ever think it will get greater than that. Probably for this year it might be a tiny bit less.\nRalph Alvarez: One other item on that, Larry, is in the U.S. because of the older, the much older restaurants, we will do between 200 and 250 rebuilds this year, so while they are not reimaging, they are major rebuilds. It is a tear down and set up and so you will see some of that as the system continues to age. That is the best thing we can do for brand. Somewhere we already know how successful we are and in most cases, our rebuilds, because we can also improve drive-thru layouts and most of those buildings back then were built way back from the street, get better visibility, et cetera. They are very strong. On the $2 million amount, we are over $2.1 million in the U.S. on our traditional restaurants. So if you say which ones are -- we are at about 1,000 Wal-marts. We do not put that in that equation because they are not a full service type, whatever. Quite honestly, the distribution is pretty tight around that $2 million because our brand is so strong and our real estate selection process over the years has been pretty solid, the way we spread out those restaurants. So yes, obviously we have some very high volume ones but we do not have a lot of very low volume ones in that equation.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, thank you. We are out of questions and out of time. I will go ahead and turn it over to Ralph for a few closing comments.\nRalph Alvarez: Thank you, and in closing, 2006 was an outstanding year and that resulted in returns on incremental invested capital, one of our key measures, far exceeding our high teens target at 35% for both one- and three-year periods, and we are off to an excellent start in 2007. The roadmap to our future remains our plan to win supported by continued focus on our customers and importantly, alignment with our owner-operators, our suppliers, and our employees. We are getting better at being better and we are confident that we will continue to build the top and bottom lines. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonalds Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin. \nMary Kay Shaw: Hello everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on the call this morning are Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner, Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen, and for QA will be Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez joining us via phone from Geneva, Switzerland. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast.  Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on our website and investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.  And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim. \nJames A. Skinner: I am please to report that McDonald\u2019s size momentum continued into the fourth quarter contributing to another very strong year. Global comparable sales were up 7.2% for the quarter and 6.9% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 20% for the quarter and 14% for the year, excluding the effect of the 2007 Latin America transaction.  Our continued success is the direct result of our focus in alignment around five factors driving the Plan to Win, menu variety and beverage choice, better restaurant operations, convenience in daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant reinvestment.  Globally, we offer unparalleled food and beverage choice across our entire menu. We serve customers when and where they want McDonalds and we provide value across the entire menu. This remains a significant predictable and attractive brand differentiation that\u2019s critical when consumers are feeling the pinch almost everywhere else in their daily lives.  Our growth began long before this recession and continued through 2008 with a strong performance in December. Now while we clearly prefer a more robust environment, today\u2019s market conditions play to our strengths. In fact, our global comparable sales continue to be strong in January with each of the area of the world\u2019s reporting positive results.  In the United States, comp sales increased 5% for the quarter and 4% for the year driving operating income growth of 11% and 8% respectively. We\u2019re very proud of these results especially considering the slowing economy and volatile commodity cost environment.  U.S. has grown market share in dollars and customer visits by leveraging its breakfast, chicken, beverage, and convenience strategies. Value, of course, remains a top priority. We continue to provide value-oriented choices while managing the impact to mitigate the impact of the business. That\u2019s why we added the McDouble, a double hamburger with one slice of cheese, to the dollar menu in December.  Customers can still enjoy the classic double cheeseburger at a tremendous value. While it\u2019s still early, we\u2019re achieving the expected results from this change about 40% of the value burgers sold of the McDoubles are 60% are double cheeseburgers. And while the dollar menu is an important component of our value strategy, in 2008 it accounted for just over 13% of sales, about where it has been since its beginning six years ago  Value isn\u2019t the only reason customers choose McDonalds, however, we also continue to make progress with our beverage strategy. Hot and cold specialty McCafe coffees are now in more than 7,000 restaurants. After completing the specialty coffee rollout in mid-year, we will continue to build our beverage business by beginning to introduce smoothies, frappes and bottled drinks.  Restaurant profitability remains a top priority. Despite the volatile commodities labor, fuel and other pressures, we expect the average U.S. franchise restaurant to see slightly positive cash flow growth in 2008, remarkable in this environment. We will continue to focus on value across the menu and operational excellence with the goal of mitigating these cost impacts to the business.  Let\u2019s turn to Europe where comparable sales were up 7.6% for the quarter and 8.5% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew at 13% and 17% for the quarter end year respectively. The number of visits customers are making to McDonalds has grown despite the decline in overall traffic within Europe\u2019s informal eating out category.  While many countries in Europe are seeing an economic slowdown, our European business remains strong. France, the U.K. and Russia in particular have not felt this impact, but we are seeing some softening in Germany. But as our results clearly show Europe\u2019s three strategies to upgrade the customer and employee experience, build brand transparency and enhance local relevance through new menu platforms are resonating with customers.  Our three-tier menu remains the main growth driver. It provides customers with greater choice and great tasting food at everyday affordable prices. Several markets have also been successful with the fourth tier between the value and core price points with the Petite du Jour in France and the new Little Tasters in the U.K.  We also continue to make progress with the implementation of our bridge operating platform or BOP. The platform enables restaurants to provide menu variety because it simplifies operations and helps improve quality. With BOP markets like France have been able to extend tier premium product range. Currently it is in approximately 75% of our European restaurants and we expect BOP to be rolled out across most of Europe by the end of this year.  We also continue to upgrade the customer experience through our continued focus on convenience or re-imaging. A focus on daypart expansion is making McDonalds more convenient and providing incremental sales in an increasing number of European markets. Eighty percent of our restaurants currently offer some form of extended hours, and in markets like the U.K. and Germany we\u2019re seeing a halo effect on our breakfast business.  Drive-through optimization is also playing a part in our growth. We have a significant opportunity to grow this part of the business by continuing to maximize efficiency capacity on order accuracy. In the area of re-imaging, we continue to make progress in many of our major markets. For instance, the U.K. remodeled 177 restaurants last year and is planning to remodel about 200 more in 2009.  And in Germany we\u2019re closing in on our goal to re-image 100% of our restaurants with only about 200 remaining. Last year Germany also added 150 McCafes, an upscale area within their restaurant that offers cappuccinos, lattes and pastries providing a place for customers to connect with each other.  Let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comp sales were up 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. Operating income also continued to grow in this region up 38% for the quarter and 28% for the year in constant currencies. Two thousand eight results were primarily driven by our three largest markets, Australia, China and Japan with most other markets positively contributing as well.  Australia, one of our established markets, had a great year posting double-digit comps every month in 2008 as well as double-digit growth in operating income for the quarter and for the year. APMEA\u2019s success is based on five platforms for growth, value, convenience, breakfast, core menu and service. In each case our goal is to ensure we\u2019re focused on the right customers and dayparts to become our customer\u2019s first choice.  Value remains a key growth driver across Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and in 2008, Japan broadened its branded affordability program to multiple price tiers while Korea and Singapore introduced value lunch programs with much success.  Convenience also continues to drive results in APMEA, 42% of APMEA\u2019s restaurants are open 24 hours, a 30% increase over the prior year, and our focus on extended hours is driving business during the morning hours.  Customers can now get breakfast in 70% of our restaurants throughout the segment yet averages almost 14% of restaurant sales. Core menu is also driving results across many markets. For example, favorites like the new chicken line in Australia and New Zealand and the recent introduction of the Quarter Pounder in Japan. Many smaller markets are also seeing success with important [inaudible] extensions.  Now before I move on, I\u2019d like to recognize a recent milestone in China, one of our high potential markets. In November we opened our one thousandth restaurant in China making it the fastest market outside the U.S. to reach this milestone. This year we plan to open another 175 restaurants, the highest number of planned new openings for a McDonalds market in \u201909. This is clearly a testament to our confidence in China\u2019s long-term potential.  Now before closing, I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts on our commitment to financial discipline and the ways in which we\u2019re enhancing shareholder value. In 2008 we returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for a total of $11.5 billion toward our $15 to $17 billion three-year target. We remain confident we will meet this goal by the end of 2009 while also preserving capital to grow our business.  Last year we invested $2.1 billion of capital into the business, and consistent with our approach in the past few years we plan to invest a similar amount in 2009 balanced between reinvestment and new restaurants. This year we plan to open up about 1,000 new restaurants specifically about 165 in the U.S., 245 in Europe and 475 in Asian Pacific Middle East Africa. After a routine closing the net new unit growth is expected to be about 650, which is right in the range of our 1% to 2% target. And consistent with our philosophy to be better not just bigger, we expect to open restaurants each year at a pace that allows us to continue to invest in our existing base and capture new opportunities. We continue to manage our business well in the current environment and I am optimistic about our outlook in 2009.  While we\u2019ve exceeded our constant currency average annual targets of 3% to 5% revenue growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth and a return on incremental invested capital in the high teens during the past few years, these targets remain realistic and sustainable for a company of our size, especially given today\u2019s market conditions. I believe our strength is driven by three things, our ability to execute, our focus on the customer and the discipline and alignment of our system that we put in place with the Plan to Win. Our franchisees, suppliers and employees continue to provide an exceptional restaurant experience for our customers each and every day. That\u2019s why I\u2019m confident we will continue to deliver positive results for our system and our shareholders.  And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Pete Bensen our CFO.\nPeter J. Bensen :  As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrate McDonald\u2019s global business is fundamentally strong. When you look at our core operating results and strip away special items, it's evident our global business is firing on all cylinders with earnings per share up double digits for both the quarter and the year. At $0.87 per share fourth quarter earnings increased 19%, 29% in constant currencies after adjusting for the $0.33 per share of tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter last year. Full year EPS from continuing operations of $3.76 included a $0.09 gain from the sale of our investment in [inaudible] and a $0.09 benefit from currency. As previously disclosed, 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $1.93 per share included a net $1.30 charge due to the Latin America transaction and a net $0.24 tax benefit. After adjusting for these items, full year earnings per share from continuing operations rose 23% or 20% in constant currencies. This performance was driven by our ongoing focus on offering customers around the world choice, convenience and value.  At the same time we\u2019ve taken action to further enhance our overall profitability and returns by controlling our G&A spending, which has declined as a percent of revenues over the last several years, by leveraging the entrepreneurial spirit of our owner operators through re-franchising and by delivering solid franchised and company operated margins.  All of these contributed to the combined operating margins increasing 320 basis points to 27.4% in 2008 after adjusting for the Latin America transaction. The shift in our ownership mix benefited combined operating margin by 110 basis points. As you know, re-franchising has direct positive implications for the long-term predictability and reliability of our cash flow.  In 2008 we re-franchised 675 restaurants primarily in the U.S. and Europe as part of our target to re-franchise 1,000 to 1,500 restaurants by the end of 2010. Re-franchising impacts our financial statements in a few ways, first it reduces total revenue dollars because we collect rent and royalty income as a percent of sales from re-franchised restaurants instead of 100% of their sales. Second, re-franchising transactions can result in greater fluctuation in other operating income as we recognize gains or losses on the re-franchising transactions. And third, re-franchising can impact margin percentages depending on the mix of lease versus owned locations and the cost structures of the restaurants that are re-franchised. As we transfer lease sites to our franchise restaurant portfolio, lease expense and occupancy cost shifts from company operated to franchise margins. There is no corresponding operating cost for owned sites. Consolidated franchise margins increased 50 basis points for the quarter driven by strong comparable sales in every area of the world partly offset by a franchise margin percent decline in Europe. While Europe\u2019s franchise margin percent is down due to re-franchising and costs related to re-imaging and extended hours, total franchise margin dollars are up in constant currencies. Experience indicates that reinvesting with our owner operators and strategic initiatives like these benefits our business for the long-term. For the full year, consolidated franchise margins rose 80 basis points to 82.3%, the highest level in 13 years.  Turning to company operated margins, consolidated company operated margins were flat for the quarter and rose 30 basis points for the year to 17.6%, the highest level since 1999. This performance is a testament to the continuing strength of our strategies including re-franchising and our ability to execute successfully around the world amidst challenging conditions. In the U.S., we drove comparable sales and visits by staying focused on customer\u2019s ongoing desire for menu variety, beverage choice, everyday affordability and convenience. At the same time effective initiatives to optimize our ownership mix and manage costs enabled our U.S. business to deliver a solid company operating margins of 18.8% for the quarter and 18.5% for the year.  While this was down 20 basis points for both periods, we are pleased the U.S. business obtained this high level in an environment where we experienced significant commodity cost increases. Our overall basket of goods in the U.S. rose in line with our expectations, 10% for the quarter and 7% for the year. In 2009, we project our overall basket to increase about 5% to 5.5% with more of this pressure occurring in the first half of the year. The commodity markets remain volatile, but as recent sharp declines and commodities make their way through our suppliers, we believe there\u2019s opportunity for us to be at the low end of this estimate. In Europe, our ongoing efforts to strengthen our brand relevance delivered strong fourth quarter and record high full year comparable sales growth, despite the softening economy. Company operated margins rose 50 basis points for the quarter and 30 basis points for the year reaching 18%, the highest level since 2000. Strong comparable sales and re-franchising benefits were partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs.  Europe\u2019s company operated margin increase is impressive considering the continuing commodity cost pressures. Our overall basket rose about 10% in the quarter and 8% for the year. Our 2009 outlook for Europe is for our overall basket of goods to increase more modestly than in 2008 at around 4% to 4.5%. Similar to the U.S. there will be more pressure in the first half of the year.  In Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa, our momentum continued with nearly all countries posting positive comparable sales for the quarter and full year. In fact about two-thirds of them, including Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, achieved double-digit comparable sales growth for the year. This strength contributed to APMEA\u2019s full year company operated margin increasing 90 basis points to an eight year high of 15.9%. For the quarter, APMEA\u2019s company operated margin declined 40 basis points.  Strong segment comp sales were offset by higher commodity costs and slowing comp sales in China. While China\u2019s economy remains challenging, we have seen improvement in January sales. Australia\u2019s comparable sales and margin performance remained exceptionally strong, but its contribution to APMEA\u2019s fourth quarter company operated margin was offset by the 25% decline in the Australian dollar. We will continue to exercise disciplined financial management to further enhance our ability to deliver strong returns in a variety of environments. This discipline is most evident in how we allocate capital to drive returns. Over the last several years, a significant portion of our capital expenditures have been devoted to re-imaging existing locations.  This has improved customer perceptions of our brand and helped drive sales, which has contributed to the return on average total assets reaching 21.8% at year end up about 800 basis points since 2004. In addition, returns on incremental invested capital have been well above our high teen\u2019s target. Our financial discipline is also reflected in our healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, which remains the highest in the restaurant industry.  This gives us ready access to capital as our recent $750 million debt deal demonstrated. It\u2019s also a positive for our owner operators and our suppliers who continue to have access to the credit they need to reinvest in their businesses.  We believe financial discipline is important for today and our future and can potentially enable us to seize opportunities when others cannot. For example, as one of the few retailers adding new units in today\u2019s weak real estate market, we have the opportunity to be even more selective and get better sites that we believe will deliver strong returns in the future.  And finally, given the unprecedented levels of volatility in today\u2019s currency exchange markets, I have a few comments about FX. As you know we operate in over 100 countries with different economic cycles and a multitude of currencies. What\u2019s unusual about the current environment is the magnitude and extent of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against nearly every foreign currency.  As a result currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter revenue by nearly $500 million and earnings per share by $0.07. Of our major currencies, the euro declined 9% in the fourth quarter versus 2007, the pound declined 24% and the Australian and Canadian dollars declined 25% and 19% respectively. These four currencies accounted for about five of the $0.07 impact.  Because there is so much volatility, it\u2019s not possible to predict the potential impact for the year with much certainty, but based on recent rates the translation impact for the first quarter is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter and continue to negatively impact us for most of the year.  It is important, however, to remember that currency fluctuation is much more of a financial reporting impact than a long-term economic one. This is because we generally purchase goods and finance our local operations into the local currency creating a natural hedge. In addition, through capital expenditures we reinvest a significant portion of our local earnings back into international markets. Our primary short-term economic exposure is the royalties we receive from our international markets, which we typically hedge. The amount of which approximates 20% to 25% of our international operating income. As always, whether currency translation is helping or hurting us, constant currency results provide a more complete picture of the underlying strength of our business when evaluating performance.  A final thought before turning it over for Q&A. It seems there isn\u2019t much optimism in the business world these days. However, I am optimistic about McDonald\u2019s in 2009 and for the long-term even in today\u2019s uncertain environment and here\u2019s why. The menu choices, convenience and value we offer continue to align well with busy consumer lifestyles. We\u2019re a globally diversified company with a proven business model that operates well in all economic cycles. We are disciplined in our operations and our financial management, and finally, we have a customer-focused plan that works. I believe that as we continue to focus on what matters most to our customers and remain nimble enough to adapt to their needs our shareholders and the entire McDonald\u2019s system will continue to benefit.  Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mary Kay so we can begin the Q&A. \nMary Kay Shaw: \n :\nSteve West \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company:  Just a quick question on McCafe and maybe you could kind of clarify you\u2019re talking about how it\u2019s helping to drive the beverages or helping to drive the same source sales comps. Any idea yet on how much of an impact it is driving the comps? I know it\u2019s in about half the stores?  Are you seeing an impact and maybe you can quantify that and let us know are the 7,000 stores meeting expectations so far today? And then maybe when do you expect to really kind of start gearing up your TV advertising on this?\nJames A. Skinner: Steve, we are on track. This is Jim. And I\u2019d really like to have Ralph Alvarez weigh in on that since he is much closer to the plan there in the U.S. than we are in this room. Ralph?\nRalph Alvarez :  Yes. We\u2019 got the 7,000 and we\u2019ve been ramping up pretty fast and as we said we\u2019ll be done by mid-year \u201909. Obviously we would not advertise nationally before that time frame and we\u2019re on track with the projections we have.  We\u2019re not going to disclose how much it\u2019s helping sales exactly and we wouldn\u2019t for competitive reasons, but we did a lot of testing and so we know what metrics we need to hit pre-advertising, local advertising, and then what we expect on national advertising. \nMark Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse. \nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse:  A quick question on the pricing outlook, in the past you guys have often talked about pricing in relation to the food at home and food away from home indices. With December food at home prices falling sequentially for the first time in two years and actually with a fairly meaningful decline, how does this factor into the pricing plans as we progress through the early part of 2009?\nJames A. Skinner:  Well we factor all that in as you know, Keith. Food away from home and index it by country of course and by segment and Ralph has just gone through this in the planning process. Ralph, do you want to comment about the pricing around the world?\nRalph Alvarez:  Yes. Your food away from home has always been during I would say normal times is a great indicator because what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure we stay a better value, at least on the price side of the equation, than anybody else in our category. When you get these type of swings like there\u2019s been so quickly we definitely factor it in. It\u2019s one of the conversations we\u2019ve had in our planning sessions here in the last month. I\u2019m in Europe, it\u2019s one of the main topics we\u2019re talking tomorrow.  So, we probably will not be taking the level of pricing here in the first half that we normally would have of the year because you\u2019ve got to consider all of how the consumer is feeling and during these times the consumer is looking for deals and we want to make sure that we\u2019re out there. The great thing is because we have our three and four-tier pricing menus we\u2019ll pull that lever harder. We would not be in the reducing price mode but we just pull that lever a little bit harder during these times. \nMark Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer.\nMatthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Just looking at the plan on where to grow and looking at where you grew in \u201908 as well. I guess Germany stands out as one of the larger markets for growth in Europe and then 136 or so in China in \u201908 and then it seems like you\u2019re looking for similar plans in growth in \u201909. Yet both those markets seem to be a little bit softer.  Is there something you have to change maybe or keep a closer eye on in developing in such an environment where the comps are coming down a little bit, or do you think it might be prudent maybe to take a little bit of a slower time now to grow given the slowdown that you\u2019re seeing in the comps before you put more stores down on the ground?\nJames A. Skinner:  Matt, good job on determining where our focus was in growth you just spelled it out for us. We are very focused and as you know when we look at growth around the world, you look at Europe and you look at the brick countries and where we\u2019re focused today.  We\u2019re in this for the long-term and our commitments over the long-term, and so what you\u2019re seeing in Germany today and that slowdown is a result of the current environment and some tactical issues that they\u2019re dealing with their. Maybe Ralph, you\u2019d like to talk a little bit more about that but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to slow there because of that particular issue today. \nRalph Alvarez:  Yes, I\u2019ll speak Germany first and then China. One the things we look at is our new store metrics and Germany has very strong metrics on even first year returns this year on the openings we're doing. Again, we're building these stores for 20 plus years and so, as Jim said, we do it for the long-term, but we have very high volumes in Germany.  Our cost of opening up those restaurants are investment relative to the cash flows that we generate, it's a very solid investment and the reason you see Germany grow like it has is we're building a fair amount of restaurants in Germany in unique locations, train stations, highways that we were not in before that are producing excellent returns and there's almost no cannibalization because it's a captive audience. When you look at China, we have in the plan for next year 175. We have a very deep inventory of sites. We had scrubbed our sites inventory to make sure those that are in more green areas the growth there of infrastructure is so fast that we've seen a little bit of that infrastructure growth slow down, we're going to slow some of those but our inventories significantly exceeds our 175 number, and so today we still think that's a pretty realistic number.  In fact, we opened over I think it was 45, 46 restaurants just in January. And the returns again in China also have been very strong. We have over 20% return on total assets in China and it's mostly as you know, been new store development here pretty aggressively the last few years. \nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Joe Buckley \u2013 B of A Merrill. \nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities:  First, a clarification on the comments in the release about China, the way it reads my interpretation is that the China comps were negative in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then secondly on the re-franchising, particularly in Europe, what sort of shifted that put some pressure on that margin and it sounds like pressure may remain on the European franchise margin in '09 because I think you've been re-franchising all year in '08 and prior to this we didn't see any pressure on that margin.\nPeter J. Benson: Yes. Joe, it's Pete; clarifying, China was not negative for the quarter, they were positive. And on the franchise margin in Europe, as I try to kind of highlight in my remarks, it really depends on the mix of the restaurants that we're re-franchising. So they've been executing these plans locally depending on which ones make the most sense for us to operate versus franchise, and as they re-franchise the restaurants that they don't want to operate, whether they're more concentrated in leased sites versus owned sites really has a dramatic impact on the franchise margin, and so we saw that be more of a swing in the fourth quarter in Europe nothing that alarmed us or nothing that was inconsistent with our plan.  And at the end of the day we look at the margin dollars and those margin dollars were up in constant currency and we know long-term that this re-franchising plan is great for the long-term cash flows and profitability of the business.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  Question on the $15 to $17 billion in returning to shareholders, to date you've given back between $11 and $12 billion, which would imply you couldn't probably give any more back to shareholders in that framework in '09 versus '08, maybe less. So, Pete or Jim, can you talk about your willingness to use your balance sheet in 2009 versus prior years? Are you going to be more conservative so what's a realistic expectation? And when's the next time you think you might revisit the return goals? I think last time you upped it sort of in the middle of the term. What would you think now in terms of updating that guidance?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, John, first of all we are on track to meet our commitment that we had talked about, the $15 to $17 billion. It still remains to be seen exactly where we'll end up in that range, but the fact is we're going to do that through the normal course of share repurchases and dividends to our shareholders and we're in good shape to get that done. And Pete may want to comment a little bit about leveraging the balance sheet in a different way, but I think we're in pretty good shape where we are. We'll revisit the target probably as we head toward the end of '09 because we'll know that you'll want to know what our expectation is beyond that.\nPeter J. Benson: John, we never pinned ourselves into a specific amount of leverage that we needed to hit our targets and so as we moved throughout the year and as we look at the credit markets we'll be opportunistic if it makes sense to use our balance sheet. But as Jim said, we're very confident of hitting that $15 to $17 billion target and we have an analysts meeting at the end of the year that we'll use to update people on 2010 and forward.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wachovia.\nJeffrey Omohundro \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets:  I'm just wondering how the China competitive strategy evolves in the context of a slowing GDP in that country, and if I heard you right, it sounded like there was a bit of a pickup in January. What do you attribute that to? \nJames A. Skinner: Well, first of all our competitive perspective on China, as we've said many times, Jeff, we're in these countries for the long haul and particularly in China for the long haul if you consider the enormous opportunity that there is there, and so our competitive positioning remains the same. The pickup in the January numbers really relates a little bit to Chinese New Year and where that falls, but in general the trend is better at January than it was in December.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS:  You've been very competitive with at home eating in most of your developed markets and I suppose a lot of that has to do with the everyday low pricing you have in place. Regarding Germany, you do have that sort of everyday low price menu but the market has been more of a struggle. Could you perhaps share why that might be in your opinion and I suppose there could be a negative thesis that this is just the first of other developed markets that may kind of reach a stumbling block where at home occasions really start to catch up with McDonalds? Any argument against that would be helpful.\nJames A. Skinner: David, if I could just make an observation, particularly if you look at the strategies and tactics of the German marketplace with very high average volumes, as Ralph mentioned earlier, over the years. I wrestled with it when I was the president of Europe relative to a sustaining value proposition everyday affordability and I think we just lost a little bit of sight of that. It is not about the fact that we're going to have a stumbling block or not be able to be competitive of meals eaten at home. And Ralph, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about where we're headed with Germany or at least what our thinking is.\nRalph Alvarez:  Yes. David, first we had positive sales and positive margins in Germany for the year they just weren't at the level that the rest of Europe was and so I just want to make sure we clarify that. The German consumer, as Jim said, is very sensitive to pricing. We made a couple of moves that we felt we needed to make off of a very strong euro menu that we have there because of the high commodity cost increases, and we paid a little bit of a price on traffic for it but nothing that took us negative.  Obviously it helped margins and we are pulling that value lever a little bit more aggressively. The German team, I know, is all over it. I'm with them for two days here this week where we're going through in details the '09 plans and our openings in '08. But it's, again, we're not concerned. It's a market is a little bit more sensitive than that but we've got a lot of strength there, and we don't think that's indicative of other markets in Europe.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from [Karen Lemark] \u2013 Federated.\n[Karen Lemark] \u2013 Federated: Could you talk at all about traffic versus say price mix by region, maybe how Q4 compared to Q3? And then any comments you have on January would be great. \nPeter J. Benson: Karen, we talk about traffic in total for the year and what we're seeing for the year is consistent. What we've been seeing throughout is that in the U.S. about 50% of the comp was driven by positive traffic. In Europe a little bit over 40% was being driven by positive traffic, and then in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa nearly 55% was being driven by traffic. So all around the world we're getting a fair contribution to traffic growth and we like that combination of price and traffic because that's really healthy.\nMary Kay Shaw: Our next question is from John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan. \nJohn Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan:  Two I think quick ones if I may, Pete you talked franchise margins in Europe it sounds like some incentives for franchisees to maybe put in extended hours and remodels. If you could help us understand the potential benefit of that cost and timing of the benefit, if it\u2019s not already in the numbers for fiscal \u201908. And secondly, if you could discuss the U.S. regionally if there\u2019s any significant performance differences and why those performance differences may be existing and whether you could apply that to anything that might be happening in the economy today?\nPeter J. Bensen:  In Europe those initiatives we talked about the 24 hours and re-imaging, about 75% of that is happening in the U.K. and Germany and we\u2019ve done programs like this in the U.S. We\u2019ve done them in Australia and other places around the world and we know in looking at our results over the last six years, those are two big contributors to our sales momentum.  So I don\u2019t have an exact sales target for you to pinpoint these, but the contributions to the margin from the franchise margin are going to happen throughout most of 2009, but obviously as that is ongoing we should start to see a sales lift as well.  So we\u2019re confident that not only in \u201909 we will start to see some top line benefit but longer term these are things that really enhance the brand and the customer\u2019s perception of McDonalds, the quality and the convenience specifically. And in the U.S. we\u2019ve really seen no significant deviation between regions everybody is positive and doing well.\nRalph Alvarez:  Let me add one piece. We have three U.S. geographic divisions they are within 20 basis points of each other for the whole year, and it\u2019s basically because we run a very strong national plan under the Plan to Win and obviously there maybe some small pockets that are feeling the economic pieces but we\u2019re a national brand and it reflects in the results.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup.\nGreg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup:  Can you just talk a little but about the state of the franchisees in terms of getting financing for remodels, new units, anything that you\u2019re doing to assist them with financing?\nJames A. Skinner:  We are very pleased with where we find ourselves relative to the credit markets, particularly with the franchisees and we\u2019re in good shape regarding our re-franchising plans and we\u2019re also in good shape relative to any initiatives we have, particularly combined beverages and other investments that are expected. We have over 90 regional banks that are lending to our franchisees, but like everybody in the credit markets today, if you want to go get credit it takes a little bit longer and it might cost a little bit more but we have access to credit and we\u2019re very pleased about that.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nSteven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs:  I have a bigger picture question it\u2019s kind of related to some of the questions that have been asked, but obviously a lot of retailers and other consumer-related companies on a global basis saw sort of a negative inflection from a consumer in December.  We talked so far on this call just about a couple of the regions where you may have seen some softening and certainly not to be nitpicky but U.S. comps while very strong, two-year trend kind of decelerated here. I guess the question is as a follow-up to a question earlier, can you comment a little bit more on what you\u2019re seeing in January to date? And then secondly, do you think you\u2019ve seen sort of that modest inflection in your consumer and the behavior of your consumer maybe even if the traffic is still there, maybe how they\u2019re using your menu and what kind of impact to margins we should be thinking about if you guys have to be a little bit more aggressive to get that consumer in the door?\nJames A. Skinner:  First of all when we look at the economic environment for 2009 that we\u2019re heading into, the recent data indicates the world\u2019s largest economies are sliding simultaneously into recession, first time since World War II. You look at the U.S. economy there\u2019s a lot going on unemployment\u2019s at 7.2% versus 4.9% a year ago, the commodity markets recessionary forces putting discretionary income at risk, and yet when you look at all of those things and you look at the European outlet look where we have similar economic challenges our model remains recession resistant.  I think it\u2019s clear when you listen to Pete talk about and Ralph talk about the balance between new visits and price impact on the top line and the impact that we\u2019ve been able to have relative to mitigating, the volatility and the cost of the inputs and the environment we\u2019re operating in, that in fact I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re going to have any great impact relative to any pricing issues in \u201909 than we had in \u201908.  As a matter of fact, I think the cost increase environment, as we\u2019ve talked about earlier, is going to go down yet when you look at consumer confidence being at an all time low it\u2019s critical that we maintain value relationship but we have that across the menu. People are trailing into McDonalds for more reasons than value when you look at the dollar menu.  As I mentioned earlier today, it has remained at somewhere between 13% and 14% since its inception in late 2002 and that\u2019s the barometer that I look at the rest is core menu the value across that menu and where customers are getting pinched everywhere. They shouldn\u2019t suffer that same fate at McDonalds and I think we\u2019re on pace to be able to continue with that model as we move through 2009.\nPeter J. Bensen :  And Steven, regarding our comments around January sales, that means that each area of the world is similar or better than what we posted in December.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Jim Baker \u2013 Neuberger Berman.\nJim Baker \u2013 Neuberger Berman :  I had a couple of questions, one I noticed that your asset disposition and other operating expense was the lowest this quarter and the lowest this year that we\u2019ve seen for fourth quarter or year in a very long time, probably since the beginning of the decade. I wonder if you can shed some light on what\u2019s going on there and what might happen going forward in \u201909? Secondly, I see you had a $5 million impairment charge in the quarter. Could you just tell us which region that was attributable to or whether it was corporate or exactly what was happening there?\nPeter J. Bensen:  We\u2019ve been now on our sixth year of revitalizing the business and the strong results we\u2019ve had throughout that period there\u2019s obviously been restaurants that we\u2019ve had to close, and I think what you\u2019re seeing on the closing and asset disposition line is fewer as a percentage of our base anyway fewer and fewer restaurants that we feel need to be closed. So in addition you\u2019re seeing that the gains from our re-franchising activity.  So, in that 1,000 to 1,500 restaurants that we plan to re-franchise, these are good performing restaurants that were selling at full value and so we\u2019re recognizing gains on those. So I would expect, while we don\u2019t give specific guidance that you\u2019d expect to see the closings be relatively lower as we move throughout 2009 and see us continue to recognize gains on selling restaurants. And regarding the impairment, that was one market in Europe, specifically Greece, and we\u2019re doing some reorganizing of the marketplace.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays\nJeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays:  Just one clarification and then a question, the clarification being on the beverage platform rollout. I think you reiterated comfort with middle of the year for a complete rollout or for the most part. I\u2019m just wondering whether there are any delays perhaps in the second leg of it being smoothies and frappes whether or not the entire rollout is going to be done by the middle of the year or whether some things have been delayed.  And then the primary question is related to G&A, looks like in your forecast you\u2019re looking for it to decline in constant dollars in \u201909 very similar to the past few years. Just wondering if you could talk about some of the major initiative there the biggest corporate opportunities perhaps, and how much of the contribution you\u2019re getting from perhaps this mix towards re-franchising where it could ultimately go long-term?\nJames A. Skinner:  First of all, when you look at the G&A and the efficiencies it\u2019s something that we continue to drive and although our target shows a modest reduction in \u201909, it\u2019s a continuing effort around resource allocation where we expect to get more efficient, and what was the first question?\nJeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays: The beverage rollout.\nJames A. Skinner: I believe that we are on track and it remains to be seen once we get to scale relative to the overall initiative and then, as we talked about, the bottled water and the frappes and the other beverage initiative exactly how quickly we get all those on line, but we're on track on an overall basis.\nPeter J. Bensen: Jeff, and just to clarify on the beverages, phase one had always been to get the espresso-based coffees in by mid-2009 and then roll with the frappes, smoothies and bottled beverages, and so we're still on track to start that second phase, if you will, in 2009. You also had another part of your question on G&A and the fact is, yes as we re-franchise more restaurants, they are less G&A intensive than company operator restaurants. So some of that G&A decline you see is because we're becoming more franchise versus company operated.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank.\nJason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities:  One quick one up front and then just a general question, just could you tell us who your average ticket is in Europe, I guess in U.S. dollars, and if you don't have it overall then maybe just some of the major markets. And then number two, if you could just talk about general daypart trends in the U.S. any change in the areas of strength, which I think has been breakfast primarily any change you've seen there. \nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, do you want to talk a little bit about the average check?\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. On the Europe average check we don't give that information specifically and it varies significantly country to country. Not just because of the currencies, but because of the group size so somewhere like France, our group size is much bigger it's much more of a main lunch and dinner entree a lot less of a snack business. So France has our highest average check, but it varies significantly. If you were to look from an exchange rate point of view, Europe is higher than the U.S. by double digits. When you look at dayparts in the U.S., our performance right now is pretty even. All dayparts were up in the fourth quarter and in December and the performance has been pretty even including breakfast, which continues to perform very, very well.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham: Just on the food cost outlook, which now you're consolidating I guess into a grocery bill, in the U.S. up 5% to 5.5% sounds like it'll be a little less in the back half of '09. Can you give us a sense of what is still driving that food cost basket up so significantly, and is it possible to see you think lower year-over-year food costs in the back half of '09? \nPeter J. Bensen: Mitch, it's primarily the proteins that are driving the basket higher for '09. As you know, in the U.S. we buy from a lot of the big producers and they secure their input costs for significant periods of time and so I'm optimistic. We don't have it in our forecast yet because we haven't seen this materialize in the absolute pricing, but I'm optimistic as they work off those feed stocks and replace them with the pricing that we're seeing today that some of that pressure will come off as we move throughout the year.  I can't yet say that I see a decline in the fourth quarter, but obviously the trends are moving in our direction and we're optimistic that we'll have less pressure on the margins from the food cost side as we move throughout the year.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Tom Forte \u2013 Telsey.\nTom Forte \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group: I had two questions, one was we've noticed in the northeastern portion of the country they've taken the McDouble off the value menu and wanted to know your thoughts on that. And then generally speaking, what are your thoughts are if you are going to see some sort of deflation in proteins in particular in beef, what is your view on pricing, especially for the McDouble and the double cheeseburger?\nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, did we take the McDouble off in the northeast?\nRalph Alvarez: Absolutely not. You may have an isolated store that has that but we're in over 95% of the restaurants across the country, and just like double cheeseburger it was never 100% because you have some unique situations in some areas, and we price for the long term. So the input price on beef goes up or down just like double cheeseburger we held that price for almost six years. There's no intentions of moving McDouble or double cheeseburger along the way.\nMary Kay Shaw:  The next question is from Paul Westra \u2013 Cowen & Company\nPaul Westra \u2013 Cowen & Company: I just have one question and one follow up. I was wondering if you can give us an update on Russia, obviously the economy has been hit pretty hard there, and the last update was that Russia was continuing to outperform European market. And then just a follow-up question on the European franchise margin that was asked earlier, have there been any incremental or sequential acceleration of programs that will boost rents sequentially here and hurt those margins in the fourth quarter more so than the prior three quarters?\nJames A. Skinner:  Paul, this is Jim, I can talk about Russia for a moment and I'll let Pete talk about the margins. If you look at the Russian market, they had double-digit comp sales in the fourth quarter of '08 that represents about 3% of our operating income. They've got 211 restaurants we're going to open 40 in '09. We're very bullish on that marketplace. They've had a little bit of a margin erosion because the inflation in the market and the cost of goods and services, but the fact is still performing very, very well.\nPeter J. Bensen: Paul, regarding rent expense in Europe, as a percentage we have a higher percentage of lease sites across Europe and, unlike the U.S., a lot of those leases have basically inflation kickers so they adjust for the inflation rates every year. So with what was some high inflation throughout 2008, we saw a lot of pressure on rents increasing in the fourth quarter that if inflation starts to moderate next year, obviously those increases won't be quite as bad.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Larry Miller \u2013 RBC.\nLawrence Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: I also had one follow up and one question. Just on the breakfast business, can you guys give us a sense of how breakfast performed in the past when there's been a rising unemployment environment like we have today? And then secondly, we're seeing a lot of sub $1.00 offers out there and you guys talked a lot about this on this call, pulling the value levers, really not just in the U.S. but around the world. Is it still your view that you're going to avoid those price wars at all costs, can you comment on that? \nJames A. Skinner: I think the answer to the last question is yes, but I'll let Ralph talk a little bit about breakfast during recessionary times and the pricing.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. Our breakfast is even more convenience driven as more of it is drive-through and take-out than the rest of our menu, and those things that are convenience driven are much less susceptible. They're much more of a necessity of people's everyday lives than invariable visits or destination visits. So we have not seen an issue at breakfast at all during those times. If any thing it actually performs pretty well.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Howard Penny \u2013 Research Edge.\nHoward Penny \u2013 Research Edge: As you think through the second half of 2009 and the rollout of your coffee strategy, there's allocations to advertising that needs to be I guess reallocated from other parts of your marketing budget. If that's correct, what percentage of your marketing budget or thereabouts in round numbers, however you want to give it, is going to be reallocated to beverages. And if it's not correct, how much are you going to take your marketing budget up in order to accommodate for the new paradigm with beverages? \nJames A. Skinner: Ralph, do you want to talk a little bit about that?\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. It's something we're very sensitive to making sure that our core advertising, our core menu advertising stays strong. The beverage strategy is very much about coffee, which is very much about breakfast, which is a big piece of our business. So it's a benefit that we have that we can talk coffee as we have over the last couple of years with the drip coffee and that has a corresponding positive effect on that business.  So we will advertise in the context of what we would allocate to breakfast. We'll add more on the drink side than the sandwich side, but the rest of the menu will have its fair share of advertising and in general we stay within the same budgets that we\u2019ve had. One of the benefits we will have is, there is a drop on the cost per gross rating point occurring in the U.S. because what\u2019s happening in the media markets and other advertisers that are not as prominent anymore and we\u2019ve been able to improve our buying efficiency and expect that to continue through \u201909. \nMary Kay Shaw: It looks like we have one last question from Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse: Just a quick follow-up for Pete, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail behind the outlook for interest expense to be flat in \u201909 versus 2008? I look at interest rates, especially given the debt offering that you just had not really increasing all that much, FX from an interest expense perspective a little bit more favorable than a lot of \u201908, and your balance is below where it was for a lot of \u201908. I\u2019m curious why interest expense wouldn\u2019t be down in 2009. \nPeter J. Bensen: Keith, it is going to be down just slightly, but what you highlighted the increase if you look at what\u2019s happened to our debt balances they have increased a little bit and so all of that stuff is actually kind of washing out. We\u2019re having a little increase in our average balance, and a little bit of decrease in the rate and a little bit of benefit from currency and when I get done with all that it\u2019s about a 1% decrease for the year, which we consider to be relatively flat. \nMary Kay Shaw: We\u2019re out of time now, so I\u2019ll just turn it over to Jim for a couple of closing comments. \nJames A. Skinner: Well, thanks everybody for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reiterate that the fundamental strength of our global business continues. Our Plan to Win is working in every area of the world. We have the right strategies in place to grow the business for the long-term and are taking the necessary steps to manage through the current environment.  Our globally diversified business positions us to deliver in all types of operating environments and is an unparalleled advantage for our system and shareholders. With that, I remain confident and optimistic that we will achieve our revenue income and return goals for the year. Thank you so much."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-10-22 16:22:09", "content": "Executives: Mary Kay Shaw - Vice President, Investor Relations James A.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me on our call today are Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner, Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen, and for Q&A will be Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez, joining us via phone from Malaysia.  Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I\u2019ll go ahead and turn it over to Jim. \nJames A. Skinner: Good morning everyone. Thanks for being on the call. There is no denying that these are interesting times to be doing business. Yet in spite of the economic and financial concerns around the world, McDonald\u2019s business is growing as we continue to be recession resistant.  For the third quarter we are reporting very strong results. Global comparable sales up 7.1%, consolidated operating income up 20%, EPS from continuing operations is $1.05, a 27% increase. And a 33% dividend increase for our shareholders. These results show that the fundamentals of our business are strong. And October sales trends indicate our momentum continues. Our plan to win and commitment to financial discipline continue to drive performance around the world. We have strong operating results, predictable and growing free cash flow, and above target returns, with a 20.8% return on average assets for the trailing 12-month period. These three aspects of our business add up to sustained profitable growth for our system and our shareholders. Specific to the shareholder return commitments, I want to point out that to date we have returned nearly $11.0 billion of the $15.0 billion to $17.0 billion target we set out to achieve by the end of 2009. We are optimistic about our ability to continue our business momentum. The simple fact is, consumer trends are still in our favor and our plans around the world are designed to capitalize on these trends. People\u2019s lives are still busy and they are only getting more hectic. Value, which has always been important, is mission-critical today. For these reasons and more, the eating outside the home market is still projected to grow over the next five years. We are well positioned to capture this opportunity. In the United States there\u2019s no doubt that today\u2019s environment is challenging for consumers and restaurants. However, we are operating from a position of strength, mitigating external factors and growing our business through targeted growth platforms. The United States posted a comparable sales increase of 4.7% for the quarter and we continue to gain market share by providing relevant food and beverages, great value at all price points, and unparalled convenience. Customers have responded to menu additions in our focus areas of chicken, breakfast, and beverages, the fastest growing segments of the eating-out market place. The southern-style chicken sandwich and the breakfast version on a biscuit are both resonating with customers. Coffee continues to be a major driver of business and we remain on track with our specialty coffee roll out. Today, about 3,800 restaurants are serving McCafe coffees and we expect to begin introducing the rest of our combined beverage business products, smoothies, frappes, and bottled drinks in mid-2009. Now there have been questions about the general credit situation and its impact on our franchisees\u2019 ability to make the necessary investments to implement the beverage platform. Our franchisees are still able to get the financing they need. Our expansive network of national, regional, and local lenders coupled with McDonald\u2019s financial strength and reputation ensures ongoing access to credit. Although processing may take a little longer and costs may be a bit higher, this is the current reality for all borrowers today. The bottom line is our strategies are not being affected. In the area of value, consumers are responding to value at all price points on our menu, our core menu continues to account for the majority of our sales, while the dollar menu is effective in helping us grow traffic and maintain customer loyalty in these tough economic times. Our owner/operators are committed to the dollar menu and we continue to explore options to keep it relevant for customers and profitable for our system. We are currently conducting, as you know, consumer testing to determine the best product offerings for today\u2019s environment and we expect to have a decision in the near future. Looking ahead, we remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to grow the business for the long term, while managing through the credit environment. Moving to Europe, our business momentum continues with a comparable sales increase of 8.2% for the quarter. Nearly every European market is contributing positively to these results. While an economic slowdown is being seen in several European countries, we have not been experiencing this at McDonald\u2019s as it relates to sales and guest counts.  In fact, while there has been a decline in informal eating out visits in the second quarter, the most recent time period for which data is available, visits to McDonald\u2019s increased. And despite the financial events of the last couple of weeks, trends indicate that the visit momentum remains strong in virtually all of our markets. We are confident that Europe will continue to drive growth through the three strategies of enhancing local relevance, upgrading the customer and employee experience, and building brand transparency. Local relevance is brought to light mainly through our menu offerings. For example, the premium hamburger has been very successful in France and Germany and we anticipate the same results in the U.K. where it was just launched this month.  In addition, we are addressing the growing demand for chicken by providing new products at various price points. In the premium tier, we have added the Chicken Legend Sandwich in the U.K. and continue to feature new chicken products on the premium platform in the fourth tier Petite du Jour line in France. Europe\u2019s ongoing restaurant reimaging and convenience efforts help upgrade the customer experience. Since 2003 we have reimaged more than 2,000 European restaurants. A large part of our reimaging this year and in 2009 will take place in our major European markets. In 2008 and 2009 the U.K. will remodel an additional 200 restaurants with an emphasis on drive-thru locations. And Germany will have reached a goal of remodeling or touching all of its restaurants, including about 650 McCafes. Increasing extended hours in drive-thru will also contribute to our growth. Currently about 70% of our European restaurants offer some form of extended hours. Comparable sales during these hours are outpacing the rest of the day and we continue to leverage this opportunity. Nearly half of our restaurants in Europe have drive-thrus. But with just 45% of sales in those restaurants coming from the drive-thru, we have huge opportunity to grow this part of our business by maximizing efficiency, capacity, and order accuracy. And while I have focused my comments on our bigger European markets, it is important to note that that we have opportunity to grow in the new restaurant development in some of these key Eastern European countries. In fact, we plan on accelerating our openings in this region over the next two years, specifically in Poland, the Ukraine, and Romania. These are just some of the reasons we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in Europe. In APMEA (Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa) the momentum remains strong as comparable sales increased 7.8% in the third quarter. Driving this growth today and into the future is a unified focus on four platforms. Food, especially core, menu, and breakfast, value, convenience and the customer experience. Breakfast represents a $450.0 million opportunity across APMEA. China, for example, has increased its breakfast business in the last year by focusing on core menu items like Egg McMuffin and premium coffee. McBreakfast is 7% of total sales versus 20% you see in countries like Hong Kong and Singapore. We still have tremendous opportunity in this market. Japan and Australia are also growing this part with breakfast sandwiches, premium hot and iced coffee drinks and pastry items. Value continues to be another cornerstone of our results in APMEA, as it is in all of our markets. In China, value is executed through a branded affordability menu, smart couponing, and loyalty cards. In Japan our 100 yen menu is driving traffic and trade up. And in Australia we recently rolled out the Value Picks program. We expect the results of all these programs to continue to drive guest counts and growth, especially in this environment. Convenience also continues to drive strong performance in APMEA. 80% of our restaurants in China are operating 24 hours. We also have a growing percentage of leveraging desert kiosks and delivery. In Japan we have 24 hours and almost 1,500 restaurants and we are working on special night-time menus. Beyond that, we are innovating around convenience with mobile ordering, e-couponing, and Pay Pass. We are very optimistic about our future growth in this area of the world, especially considering McDonald\u2019s is just getting started in many of these markets. In closing I want to reiterate that McDonald\u2019s is operating from a position of strength. As we enter the final quarter of the year, I am optimistic about McDonald\u2019s outlook. We are a strong, stable global business and remain well positioned to generate long-term, profitable growth for our system and our shareholders. And now I will turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO, for his comments.\nPeter J. Bensen: Good morning everyone. I am pleased by our strong results and continued momentum in the third quarter. Jim mentioned the strategies driving our sales and guest count growth in each area of the world. At the same time, profitability and returns are benefiting from our unparalled global supply chain, disciplined operations, and strong financial management. Combined operating margins, a key profitability measure, reached 27.5% year-to-date September. This is up 290 basis points over the same period last year, after adjusting for the 2007 Latin America transaction. This significant increase reflects our solid company-operated and franchised margin performance, along with ongoing G&A control. In constant currencies, G&A was flat in the third quarter as lower expenses in Latin America offset costs associated with our brand-building Olympics-related activities. We remain committed to continuing to control G&A, which declined as a percent of revenues for the nine months, as it has for each of the last five years. The strength of our business and the effectiveness of our strategies are reflected in our restaurant margins. Franchise margins as a percent of revenues increased 60 basis points in the third quarter to 82.9%, its highest level since 1994. Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 11% in constant currencies, driven by positive comparable sales momentum in every area of the world as well as our refranchising efforts. Consolidated company-operated margins rose 40 basis points to 18.7% in the third quarter due primarily to improvement in APMEA as well as Europe. In APMEA strong comparable sales fueled the company-operated margin increase of 120 basis points to 17%, its highest level in eight years. The ongoing strength of our business in Australia and China led this performance, although nearly every market contributed to the increase. Australia\u2019s Crispy Chicken line-up and extended hours helped drive double-digit comp sales growth and margin improvement in the quarter. In China we continue to grow margins despite the inflationary environment. Given our menu variety, supply chain efficiencies, and comparable sales momentum, we are well positioned to navigate in this environment and further grow our business. As such, we plan to open nearly 150 restaurants in China this year, a growth rate of about 17%. In Europe, our ongoing sales momentum helped company-operated margins increase 50 basis points to 20%, its highest level since 1999. While labor and commodity cost head winds continue to pressure margins, the growing significance of two of our most profitable European countries, France and Russia, as well as improvement in many smaller markets, drove Europe\u2019s increase. In the third quarter our beef costs in Europe rose nearly 16% and chicken increased 12% but because about 75% of our food and paper cost is spread among 10 different items, our overall grocery bill increased just 9% for the quarter. We believe looking at our total basket of goods, or our grocery bill, is a more complete way to look at how commodity costs impact our food and paper costs. Our full-year 2008 outlook is for Europe\u2019s overall grocery bill to increase about 8%. This reflects a full-year outlook for beef and chicken cost increases of 12% and 9% respectively, slightly higher than we thought in July. Moving to the U.S., our U.S. business delivered a very solid 18.2% company-operated margin. This is down just 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to higher commodity costs. We are very pleased with this result considering the challenging cost environment. It demonstrates both the continuing strength of our strategies and our ability to execute successfully. For the quarter, U.S. beef costs rose 4% and chicken was up 6% contributing to the overall U.S. basket of goods increasing about 7%. This compares quite favorably with the 12% increase in the food component of the PPI for the same period.  For the full year, our outlook for the U.S. grocery bill is also to be up 7%. This includes a beef and chicken outlook similar to that expected back in July, beef up about 8% and chicken up about 6%. In this extremely volatile environment we remain diligent about monitoring the commodity markets. We believe there are opportunities here and we are confident we can continue to effectively manage our input costs in this environment by leveraging our scale and utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and effective risk management practices. It\u2019s worth noting that our goal is to maintain competitive and predictable commodity pricing. We manage our grocery bill like a portfolio, where increases in some commodities can be offset by lower prices on others. Our comprehensive approach to restaurant profitability and margin focuses not only on cost but also price and product mix. This approach continues to be successful, as exemplified by our industry-leading company-operated margins around the world. Our global results are a testament to the strength of our business model and its flexibility to deliver in a variety of operating environments. This enables us to maintain our focus on the long term and continue to invest in key growth opportunities. For example, with our U.S. owner/operators we continue to invest in the roll out of our new beverage business and expansion of our drive-thru booths at the same time. This expansion not only fully enables the beverage business, it also benefits all drive-thru transactions through a more efficient lay out. In addition, we continue to reimage restaurants around the world, improving the overall customer experience and building brand perceptions.  Our ability to take advantage of key opportunities like these reflect our strong financial foundation. Our cash is held around the world in investments that prioritize capital preservation over yield. We maintain a strong credit rating, the highest in the restaurant industry. Our owner/operators continue to have access to credit through a network of national, regional, and local lenders. We have access to, but are a minor user of, the commercial paper markets.  Our $1.3 billion revolving line of credit has sufficient term remaining and is unused and we secured attractive long-term financing in the first quarter to prefund debt that was retired in the third quarter and we have no additional significant maturities until late 2009. Our prudent long-term approach to financial management has given us flexibility and strength in these unprecedented financial markets. We believe it continues to be exactly the right strategy for today and our future and can potentially enable us to seize opportunities when others can\u2019t. One final comment before closing. As a global business, we operate in over 100 countries with different economic cycles and a multitude of currencies. It\u2019s one of our strengths and may in fact be one of the reasons you invested in McDonald\u2019s. It also means we are impacted by changes in currency translation rates. Over the last few months the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many foreign currencies, especially the Euro and British pound. While this means translation will move against us in the fourth quarter the good news is that it seems to be having a positive impact on oil and other commodity prices. We are proud of our results through the first nine months of the year, particularly given the global economic environment. We remain focused on being better not just bigger, while leveraging a business model that operates well in a variety of economic conditions. I am confident that as we continue to focus on what matters most to our customers and maintain discipline in our operations and financial management, we will further strengthen our global business. Now I will turn it over to Mary Kay to begin the Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw: (Q&A Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew Difrisco - Oppenheimer & Co.\nMatthew Difrisco - Oppenheimer & Co.: You mentioned earlier in the call, you used the term that you\u2019re recession resistant. Historically Europe has been a little bit more of a middle-class consumer and I would assume China and Asia, your experience is similar there. Do you think with the line-up and with the change of philosophy with how you are approaching growth in those markets, are you also recession resistant there or do you expect we will see a little more volatility, potentially, if these markets follow the trend of the U.S. consumer?\nJames A. Skinner: I commented a little bit on that in saying that we are seeing some slowdown in those markets today, relative to the economic issues and the financial crisis in the credit markets and consumer confidence, but we\u2019re not seeing it at McDonald\u2019s.  And we have continued to charge forward with our growth in China. For example, we are going to open 150 restaurants in China and next year we\u2019re going to open more and we\u2019re going to continue to open restaurants in Europe. And so we are confident that we will have the same strategic opportunity in those markets and continue to push forward, particularly with value and convenience, that will be able to show that we are as resistant in those markets, relative to recession, as we are in the United States.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from John Glass - Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: We have been in this unprecedented period of FX swings and two questions. Beyond the Euro/pound relationship, which you have highlighted and then sensitivity of earnings, is there material risks to other currencies moving against you and maybe could you quantify it.  And in talking about that, Latin America particularly seems to be an area of concern recently. Do you get paid in dollars for their royalties or are you paid in local currencies and is that a translation risk and is there any further risk beyond just the translation risk? Particularly related to Latin America?\nPeter J. Bensen: I will answer the second part first. We get paid in dollars from Latin America. So our DL partner down there has all the currency risk. So another reason to do the transaction the way we did it. The dollar seems to be strengthening against everybody around the world. The Euro and the pound are the two biggest but if I went kind of sequentially, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar are probably the next two biggest.  We don\u2019t like to forecast exactly what currencies are going to do because they change daily. But as a perspective, if we look at last year\u2019s fourth quarter our average Euro rate was $1.45 and our average pound rate was $2.04. To give you a little order of magnitude of where we\u2019re at relative to last year.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities: Back to the food comments, I guess the beef costs in the U.S. being up 4% in the third quarter surprises me that it was that modest. But then if you\u2019re keeping the full-year forecast of up 8%, does it imply a huge, like 20%, beef cost inflation in the fourth quarter?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes, it does. And that had been our outlook, we knew this was coming kind of September through December but again, to put it into perspective, our basket of goods was up about 7% for the quarter and we expect it to be up 7% for the full year. So the fourth quarter basket will be slightly higher than the third quarter, but not dramatically higher.  And so that\u2019s why we are trying to give a little bit broader perspective on how all of the food costs were going to impact us, not just beef and chicken. And that obviously is just looking at the cost side of the equation. I think our results this year have shown we have done a good job in being able to take price. Our price increases in the U.S. are still below the food-away-from-home. We still think there\u2019s price elasticity there and we have product mix shifts and guest count growth that also impact the margins.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan: In the U.S. the year-to-date comp has been up I think 3.7 and price, as you stated previously, is running up about 4. And traffic, from what I understand, is at least around half of the comp. So could you comment on negative mix that you have seen in the U.S. in 2008 and I guess more importantly, as you move forward, whether things like beverages, change in the dollar menu, and even lower gas prices at the consumer level may actually create a positive mix environment for you as we move forward.\nRalph Alvarez: I wouldn\u2019t call it negative mix. The problem with an average check is you have a lot of different transactions in there. So our breakfast business, as we have said, in the U.S. continues to grow faster than rest of day and breakfast is a lower average check but a higher margin transaction.  The same way with drinks. We were strong in our drink promotions through the summer, as we have talked about. Coffee is up more than 30% and a lot of those end up being transactions that are during off-peaks which are also smaller average checks, or they are only individual versus family purchases. So those things are in the equation you have there and there has been some trade-down, as you would expect during these times, and that\u2019s why we have good value across the whole menu and have actually been strong in pushing our items like Snack Wraps, in order to have an option for our customers.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser - Buckingham: I would just like to understand the margins in the third quarter in Europe and Asia Pac. The comps were generally the same in Europe and Asia Pac in the second quarter versus the third quarter and yet the margin improvement was pretty substantial. I know you mentioned some mix shifts in Europe. Was there incremental pricing in the quarter as well? And do you think these levels of expansion are sustainable over the next few quarters?\nPeter J. Bensen: Europe I will talk about first. That mix shift really did have an impact on the margins. Last September France and Russia, which both have margins over 20%, they were about 17% of the McCopco margin dollars. And now as a result of their growth, as well as the refranchising in the U.K. and Germany, they are now over 20% of the McCopco margin dollars. So we have a higher quality of the remaining McCopcos that are driving that margin percentage for the segment. Pricing was pretty normal and consistent. It was 3% to 4% amongst the major countries in Europe with Russia being higher because of the higher inflation there. As I mentioned in the outlook regarding next quarter, we see, in Europe, a similar cost environment, our basket of good expectations are pretty similar for the fourth quarter as they were for the third quarter. And regarding APMEA, continued strength in Australia and China really led the way, but almost every market had McCopco margin increases. Again, doing a good job of using their strategic pricing to manage the price increases as commodity costs were continuing to come in. So I think they will continue to manage that way going forward as well.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclay.\nJeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclay: Jim, in the U.S. business you mentioned the value focus being mission-critical. I was just wondering if you could talk about your U.S. product pipeline, other than coffee, in coming months and quarters and whether value will be more indicative or evidenced in those promotions going forward, relative to perhaps some context of your peers.  And then you mentioned in the release and on the call the October comp remains strong. I believe that was a global comment. I\u2019m just wondering whether it\u2019s strong relative to September or are you seeing an uptick? We\u2019ve heard recently of mix shifts lately, of comps slowing in the past month or two. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything like that?\nJames A. Skinner: The trend we\u2019re seeing right now is really consistent with what we just reported for the third quarter, for October. So I\u2019m not going to say more about it but I would suggest that that means the trend is strong. We just reported the number for the third quarter and October is on trend to replicate that. Around the world. The other question was on the value. The U.S. company is taking under advisement with their franchisees, over the near term, what to do about the dollar menu. We have been looking at that relative to how to make that continue to be relevant for our customers, at the same time maintaining the dollar menu, but maybe adjustment of the lead sandwich. And they\u2019re talking about that in the near term and I expect to have a decision soon. Other than the dollar menu and then the relationship of the food and the value, across the menu, which we\u2019ve done a good job of representing here in the United States, I think that will continue as we move into 2009.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Lawrence Miller - RBC Capital Markets.\nLawrence Miller - RBC Capital Markets: There is a lot of focus on the credit markets here in the U.S. but it seems to be more of a global issue. And part of your strategy has been to refranchise the U.K. I was wondering if you could give us an update on what the credit markets are doing in that particular market.  And then if you could just fill in a little bit of the sales color in those three markets over the quarter. You know there has been a lot reports that those markets are also seeing a slowdown in other retail sales and traffic.\nRalph Alvarez: First, on the credit markets, we are on plan and our franchisees have access to cash, specifically in the U.K. and Germany where we are doing the refranchising. So those deals are on plan. They were in the third quarter and will continue into the fourth and going forward. So no issues there. It takes a little bit longer to get the credit and it\u2019s a little bit more expensive, as you would expect, but the access is there. As far as the other question, sales in Europe were strong throughout the geographies. We had a very strong summer and October continues the same way. The U.K., as we have mentioned before, has done a tremendous turnaround in the last 24 months and we have not seen any slowdown in that acceleration, even with what we hear out there in the market place. And the same thing with France. Germany had a softer September but it bounced back strong in October and that\u2019s more promotional-related between the years.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: A question on the dollar menu. You mentioned a couple of times you expect a decision near term. That\u2019s clearly something people are going to be focused on, on what you guys do there. You have been testing a bunch of different markets, a bunch of different things. At this point in time how well do you feel you have a sense for what the competitive response might be in those markets, the test markets at this point? And what would you anticipate competitor response to be to raising some prices? Would they follow or would that be a market share opportunity for them?\nJames A. Skinner: First of all, you are assuming that we are going to be raising prices. I don\u2019t know that that decision has been made yet, particularly regarding the overall dollar menu. I suggested that the U.S. is debating this issue right now and deciding which way they want to go in collaboration with their franchisees, who know how important it is to maintain the value relationship across the menu for our customers today. And that decision will be made soon and will then be communicated.  But maybe Ralph would want to talk about what we suspect the competitors might do regarding this.\nRalph Alvarez: Quite honestly, we\u2019re not worried about what they may or may not do. They\u2019ve got the same pressures. You\u2019ve seen their margins. You\u2019ve got to manage this for the long term. We\u2019ll do what\u2019s right for the customers and what\u2019s the right sustainable long-term value.  And dollar menu will stay. There are just probably going to be some tweaks to it. But, as you noticed, in September we advertised the dollar menu strongly. And obviously we wouldn\u2019t be doing that if we would be walking away from it.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Jason West - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank Securities: I know you have historically talked about 6% to 7% annual operating income growth. I just want to get your thoughts on that just given the big currency swing that we may see into 2009. Do you think that is still what you are thinking or is that more of a currency-neutral kind of number and I know you don\u2019t give guidance but just where expectations are, are they reasonable given the big currency swing that we are going to see?\nJames A. Skinner: I think they are. We have not considered changing our targets. I shouldn\u2019t say that, we talk about it all the time, the fact is we think that our stated targets of 3% to 5% and 6% to 7% continue to be relevant and makes sense for us as we look at the future and as we measure the past. And so I think we\u2019re probably going to be staying in that range.\nPeter J. Bensen: And just to clarify, we have always stated those targets exclude FX. So those are currency-neutral outlooks.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: The iced tea and iced coffee introductions are not really introductions in some cases, I guess just broadening of the offerings, and were a big success in the U.S. this summer. I\u2019m wondering to what degree do you think that that lift might diminish as the season grows colder here in the U.S., and conversely, I guess about 25% of your U.S. stores should be ready to start selling specialty coffee beverages heading into the fourth quarter. Could that be a measurable lift to business this winter? Regarding Europe, could you perhaps update us, are you fully rolled out on the bridge operating platform in the Big Three market and could this kick off a more robust innovation cycle perhaps around chicken in the very near term in Europe? And could you comment on currency? Did you take any steps to hedge, like Pearce, Heinz, and Cooke seem to do, over the summer?\nRalph Alvarez: Our drink strategy throughout the summer was strong. It really helped our traffic. And items like the sweet iced tea are more of an everyday type of value. The iced coffee is more seasonal. And that\u2019s where, not as much this winter, but as we continue going forward and we finish with the roll out, then you all into the hotter drinks of lattes and cappuccinos will help fill that gap.  But we have continued with good value on our drinks and our drink volume continues up in October. So we are seeing that not be an issue. On the bridge operating platform, in the major countries we are rolled out enough, or almost at 100%, where we are able to do more of the chicken promotions. It\u2019s part of the U.K. success. They have had premium products along with Snack Wraps and so we\u2019re hitting chicken on both the value side and the premium price, similar to what we have been able to do in the U.S. And so that is benefitting us there, it\u2019s benefitting us in Australia, also, and in Germany as we have been able to put that through the calendar. So you\u2019re correct on that one.\nPeter J. Bensen: And regarding hedging, our treasury folks are constantly looking at the currency markets and our goal is to provide some stability and predictability. We can only hedge certain flows that come back and unlike some other companies, just a portion of our top line comes back to the U.S., so the pool of earnings that we can get hedge accounting for is probably smaller than other companies but we are constantly looking at the markets and being opportunistic when we put on positions.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group.\nTom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group: You have historically talked about the percentage of sales mix you get from the value menu. Can you update that number?  And then when we think about the Monopoly promotion this year and how most of the items that have the game pieces on them are some of the higher priced items, how should we think about how that may perform in the environment now with consumers focusing more on value?\nJames A. Skinner: First of all, the mix on dollar menu remains the same, 13% to 14%, and 70% from core, which is the real advantage of the dollar menu and the opportunity for us to continue to provide value across the menu.\nRalph Alvarez: [As to the Monopoly promotion,] that\u2019s our strategy always with Monopoly, added value for more price and Monopoly is comping against last year\u2019s Monopoly. Only offset by a week. So we did it in October last year and as we have said, the trends are strong, so it\u2019s working well.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Credit Suisse: I would like to ask a question about pricing. We have talked about the value menu. Just for the overall menu, and particularly on the core, one of the things that you have often highlighted has been the fact that your pricing has been running below CPI and this year it has been running well below food-at-home or grocery store pricing. We have heard recently several packaged food companies and a couple of grocers making resistance to pricing, particularly in September. Consider that beef trimmings are off, greens are off, from their peaks, company-operated margins are very high, how do you think about that pricing on the core menu going into next year?\nRalph Alvarez: We have got our demand-based pricing models and so we get pretty good information. Because we have a limited menu and we do a lot of transactions, the data we get is pretty rich as to resistance to price movements as we take them in different parts of the country. And so we understand where that resistance comes in and that affects what we\u2019re willing to move.  And so right now we continue to stay just below food-away-from-home. We think that\u2019s the best index for us because that puts us where we believe value is most important, you know, directly from our competitors. But we do watch food-at-home and our value scores, a big part of our improvement, and they have improved significantly this year and we believe it\u2019s because food-at-home has grown so much higher, that it makes our category a better deal than necessarily eating at home. As we look to next year, our pricing is that inflation will be similar to this year, is what we think right now, relative to food-away-from-home.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Paul Westra - Cowen & Company.\nPaul Westra - Cowen & Company: Can you help us quantify or at least qualify your thoughts on the impact of what gasoline prices will do? Hopefully we are approaching up to $1.00 a gallon less year-over-year. Have you looked into that, how that hurt you on the way up and how it may hurt you on the way down and whether it will act like a stimulus check or not?\nJames A. Skinner: We do keep an eye on it but we have said all along because of our convenience in value we sort of stayed above the noise, relative to the cost of gasoline. But relative to everything else, it is going down. It should help. It should be a positive factor rather than a negative factor.\nRalph Alvarez: And the big positive there is obviously disposable income. You know, we\u2019re not as dependent on traffic as other brands may be, but gasoline is one of those discretionary income items, and that\u2019s where we will get the benefit.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities: One follow up to my first question and then a new one. Just your thoughts for 2009 in terms of food costs and the basket of goods. And could you update on what the renovation costs are, as you roll out the specialty coffee, and what portion of that McDonald\u2019s is paying for versus the franchisees? And what sort of changing as you accelerate the roll out?\nPeter J. Bensen: Regarding 2009, obviously there is unprecedented volatility in the commodity markets right now. And so our supply chain folks are in the process of working through all that with our suppliers. I don\u2019t have a number for you today, I will have a number in January. Directionally, though, with what\u2019s going on today, if we see that continue, I have got to believe the increases will be less than they have been this year but I can\u2019t verify exactly the number for you right now. In terms of our investment in the beverage business, we haven\u2019t changed from what we originally stated at the beginning, which was it would probably cost about $100,000 on average to have the restaurant implement the beverage sale along with the drive-thru booth optimization. About $75,000 of that $100,000 was related to lease-hold improvements and things and $25,000 was equipment. We had agreed to pay up to 40% of the lease-holds. And so all of that is the same as when we rolled out the program. The actual costs are coming in slightly under but not meaningfully under the $100,000. So we think that\u2019s still a good estimate.\nJames A. Skinner: And I think it\u2019s interesting that the number of people that are expanding their drive-thru footprint and putting the full package in place is greater than we had thought originally. And so when you hear this anecdotal information that we don\u2019t have support and buy-in and we don\u2019t have credit, that number is actually higher than what we originally thought it was going to be.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham: I wanted to ask about the specialty coffee program as it relates to the experiences, I guess you\u2019re in about 3,800 stores now. I would think at least 1,500 or so have had the program for over a year. Can you give us a sense of is it meeting your internal expectations? And can you give us a sense of how the drive-thru is working in terms of is it slower, quicker than average, and versus your internal expectations?\nRalph Alvarez: We are on track. We had about 500 restaurants that were on it for a year before making a decision to continue. It then allowed us to refine the operational pieces of the program and really work on the drive-thru booth, which is a big part of the roll out. And that\u2019s why the take on the drive-thru booth has increased, because with those items, it helps improve the whole drive-thru operation and allows us to deliver this.  Our scores that we do through both our internal measurements and mystery shops show that we continue to improve, as we have over the last few years, even in those restaurants that have put this in. And that was one of the key measures for us. We are on track on both the sales and the operational scores and it is a matter of getting the conversions done through the rest of the restaurants between here and sometime mid-next year.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: I just wanted to circle back on the franchisees and their attitude toward the value menu, because I know oftentimes those of us on the outside seem to make a mountain out of a molehill, but when I kind of look at your restaurant level margins in the U.S. year-to-date and see that they\u2019re only down 20 basis points, and sales are up in the 3% to 4% range so cash flow per store is up, and I know that from past conversations franchisees actually have higher margins than the company-operated stores, when I look at the competitive set where sales may be up also in the 2% to 3% or 2% to 4% range and margins are down 150+ basis points, are franchisees really seeing the value menu, are they really pushing back against the value menu or are they seeing it as an opportunity to take market share, given that cash flow per store should up and it\u2019s just those of us looking in from the outside are making something out of something that\u2019s really nothing?\nJames A. Skinner: Ralph and I had the pleasure of meeting with the franchisee leadership just last week and talked through the issues of the environment we find ourselves in today, and of course dollar menu was part of that discussion. But as I said in my comments, the operators are still committed to the dollar menu. And of course, as I said, we\u2019re looking today at how we might make that more relative and continue to be profitable. Ralph, I think you might be closer to it than I am.\nRalph Alvarez: I think the reality is, no different than us. Operators being just slightly up in cash flow does not meet their expectations when they\u2019re doing the investments they\u2019re doing. And we\u2019ve been aggressive on investments, whether it\u2019s been reimaging or rebuild. We\u2019ve done 1,000 rebuilds in the U.S. in the last five years. Or the investment we\u2019re making in the combined beverage business now. So the commodity cost is one of those items that because we don\u2019t control it, and operators don\u2019t either, it is a sense of frustration. And that\u2019s what you end up hearing. And rightly so. But they understand that we\u2019re managing much better than the market place during this time. They understand the importance of everyday value and that we also understand with them that some level of migration on that value menu is important in order to keep the good value scores balanced across the menu. At some point. You can\u2019t raise the price on everything else and leave dollar menu the same, as we have for six years, in inflationary times. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re finding out. What do you do that still keeps the customers coming but keeps the balance of price value across the whole menu and not just great value on the dollar menu and average value on the rest. And those are the discussions that our operator body is having as we speak and that we\u2019ve been having. I\u2019m confident they will make the right decision because we have a lot of tests out there with good, robust data.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Howard Penny - Research Edge.\nHoward Penny - Research Edge: Ralph, you just mentioned that you thought you would have the stores converted by mid-year next year. There are 3,800 stores today. I know there is a fairly rapid acceleration of the number of stores converted. But that sort of implies a significant acceleration of the number of stores converted to be able to get to that completion date, sort of midpoint next year. Is that realistic to think that you can do 11,000 to 12,000 stores in the next six months?\nRalph Alvarez: The biggest part, I always say is have you ever done a remodel on your kitchen at home. You know how difficult it is. Imagine doing 14,000 of them. And that\u2019s what has been going on in the U.S. So the hardest part of that work is getting the drawings drawn for every single location, making sure you get all the fabrication going, etc., the permits and so forth. That part of it, which really is 2/3 of the time frame, we\u2019ve got more than 10,000 restaurants that are completed through that piece. So even though there are only 3,800 open the majority of the restaurants are somewhere in that construction time line and we feel confident that it continues on path pretty close to where we thought we were going to be in the beginning, sometime in mid-year.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question comes from Lawrence Miller - RBC Capital Markets.\nLawrence Miller - RBC Capital Markets: I think it was maybe two years ago Wendy\u2019s tried to move from a $0.99 menu to I think they called it a Value Choices menu or something where the prices went higher. As you study the competition, what do you think maybe didn\u2019t work and you can learn from that going forward? And it looks like after the election there is maybe going to be a Democratic President, Democratic Congress. And as you think about the potential legislation that can go through in 2009, what impact should we be aware of on your business potentially in 2009? It looks like there might be an impact on labor with Check Card and minimum wage. Can you talk about that just briefly?\nRalph Alvarez: What we\u2019ve done is we have studied our customer. We are not sure about Wendy\u2019s customers. We know we obviously trade customers, but we have studied our customers, specifically our Dollar Menu customer, very strongly as to what are the motivating drivers, how much of it is that fact that it is a dollar, how much of the items are transaction drivers or how much of the visits are those are add-ons to, for example, extra value meals. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re making the decision. And we have been pretty up front that at this point we are going to stick with the name Dollar Menu. So that tells you a lot right there. And we think that is an important part of how our customers view this offering today. I\u2019m not sure why they had the impact they had but we think we understand where our customers are on this one and know it\u2019s not without risk, but understand the ramifications.\nJames A. Skinner: And relative to the political environment, McDonald\u2019s is a big company but at the same time it\u2019s 32,000 small businesses. And so we operate in 32,000 communities around the world, and in the United States we operate in 10,000 communities. And it\u2019s really about our franchisees and their ability to operate their businesses effectively, certainly with our support strategically and relative to our customer relevance and focus on the stores. So we\u2019re not concerned, really, about who the next president is going to be relative to how we operate our business. We have been around for 52 years and operated under every administration, obviously successfully. Relative to the Employee Free Choice Act, there is concern in the market place and small businesses about this and particularly large businesses, where as you know, the potential new law would eliminate the requirement of a secret ballot to unionize, making it easier for unions, supposedly, to win elections. Instead of the secret ballot 50% or more of the employees simply have to check off an agreement. We feel, though, that if that legislation is adopted that because of our dispersed locations, the fact that each of these is a small business run by franchisees, with the exception of the 15% or 20% that are company owned, that those have to be done one at a time and that we are able to operate in that environment. And that our younger workers really, when it gets right down to the voting, I\u2019m not sure want to spend their discretionary income on union dues are being unionized and not really a lot of benefit for them. So that\u2019s sort of the way we look at the Employee Free Choice Act.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your final question comes from Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: On the franchise level margins, looking globally across the different regions, the franchise level margins seem to range from 78% or 79% and you\u2019re up to somewhere up to 90% in Asia Pacific. As you continue to refranchise, how do should we think about what the target franchisee margin could be as we get to the end of 2009? Or how much opportunity is there for you to push that on a percentage basis and obviously the actual dollars would increase as well as franchising would become a larger portion of your business?\nPeter J. Bensen: The most dramatic impact we have on franchise margins is obviously driving comp sales. So Asia obviously is a lot higher because we have our Japanese joint venture there that pays us a royalty with no corresponding cost hitting the franchise margin line.  So if you start at this year\u2019s levels, your comp assumptions will be a bit part of where we are going to get to in 2009 because a lot of those occupancy costs are fixed. The disparity between regions is somewhat indicative of where we do more leasing versus property ownership, so you may know that in cases where we own the property we have no costs hitting the franchise margin because we don\u2019t depreciate land, but if we lease sites we obviously have lease expense that is shown as an occupancy cost. The other impact is on our refranchising, as we are putting more restaurants in the hands of franchisees there is a greater proportion of lease sites are becoming franchised. So it is having a slightly negative impact on the franchise margin but by far the biggest impact is what are comps going to do to drive the top line.\nRalph Alvarez: And on that one, because a lot of that early refranchising activity that we did was in the U.K., which is a market place where we have a lot of leases, that actually has had a dilutive impact on franchise margins in Europe, but it has been more than offset by the strong comparable sales.\nMary Kay Shaw: And now I will turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for joining us this morning. In closing I want to reiterate my confidence and optimism for our continued business momentum. McDonald\u2019s is operating from a position of strength. We have the right strategies in place and are on track to grow the business for the long term and are taking the necessary steps to manage through the current environment. Our strong operating results, predictable in growing free cash flow, and above target returns, add up to sustained profitable growth for our system and our shareholders.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-07-23 20:23:10", "content": "Executives: Mary Kay Shaw - Vice President, Investor Relations Ralph Alvarez - President, Chief Operating Officer, Director Peter J.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on our call today are Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez, joining us via phone from New Zealand; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Benson.   Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Ralph, I want to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments today. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph. \nRalph Alvarez: Thank you, Mary Kay and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report that our solid business performance continues and every area of the world is contributing to our growth. In the second quarter, comparable sales increased 6.1%, consolidated company-operated and franchise margins grew for the 10th consecutive quarter, and consolidated operating income excluding the impact of the 2007 Latin America transaction increased more than $240 million, or 17%. That\u2019s 9% in constant currencies. We\u2019ll start by talking about the strategies driving our momentum, then I\u2019ll share some highlights about the business in our primary segments, the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, or APMEA, as we call it. Pete will then go through the numbers in greater detail before we open it up for Q&A.  The entire McDonald's system is aligned and executing our Plan-to-Win. Our ability to continue building our business in every area of the world is a direct result of our better, not just bigger strategy and our capability to execute that locally. Our momentum is driven by five factors that are contributing to our success in every market.  The first is branded affordability. Everyday, predictable low prices are what customers expect from McDonald's. We pride ourselves on being able to provide good value for the money at every price point.  Menu variety and beverage choice is a second driver. Our food pipeline has never been richer. We\u2019re developing products our customers want.  The third success factor is better restaurant operations. An ongoing focus on the fundamentals has improved the customer experience and strengthened brand trust.  Convenience and day part expansion is the fourth factor. We\u2019re serving customers when and where they want McDonald's -- with more than 31,000 restaurants located where people live, work and shop, it\u2019s easy to make us a part of your daily life.  And finally, ongoing reinvestment -- we strive to provide a relevant modern restaurant experience, especially as our customers\u2019 needs continue to evolve. And while we continue to make strides in each of these areas, we believe there are opportunities to do even more.  With that said, I would like to share a few details on how each area of the world is contributing to our success today and positioned to drive results into the future.  In the U.S., we continued to deliver solid results by growing our customer base. Comparable sales for the quarter were up 3.4%, of which 75% came from increased guest counts. And operating income was nearly $800 million, an increase of 6% over last year.  We generated solid results despite a slowing economy, demonstrating McDonald's is well-positioned to perform in these challenging environments. Our three-tier pricing strategy contributes to that success, and the dollar menu, which represents about 14% of sales, is an important part of this strategy. Support for the dollar menu remains strong throughout the U.S. system, in spite of commodity and other cost pressures.  As we balance increasing costs with the need to provide value to our customers, we continue to test other options, as we have since the dollar menu was first introduced over five years ago.  Although we expect our value offerings to evolve over time, any future changes will be guided by our thorough testing processes and of course, mainly by the consumer. And while value is an important part of our foundation, it is only one of the drivers of our business. Our growth strategies of breakfast, chicken, beverages, and convenience continue to deliver results.  During the second quarter, we launched a Southern Style Chicken Sandwich and a breakfast version on a biscuit. Both products have proven popular with our customers and also, the Chicken Biscuit is a key contributor to breakfast sales, which remains our fastest growing day part.  Our second big driver during breakfast hours has been beverages, especially coffee. Total coffee sales continue to increase, led by iced coffee, which is in 12,800 restaurants today. We are very pleased by the growth and momentum of our premium drip and our specialty coffees. Specialty coffees is just one element of the combined beverage business and it\u2019s currently in more than 1600 restaurants.  Throughout 2009, we will add smoothies, frappes, bottled beverages, and energy drinks. The implementation of the entire line of beverages in these fast-growing categories will move us from providing drinks that complement our food to becoming a beverage destination, and the related optimization of the drive-thru area of our kitchen will benefit operations and sales throughout the day.  Overall, we are very pleased with our results in the U.S. and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead.  Now let\u2019s turn to Europe, where we also had another strong quarter. Our top line sales and guest counts are strong and have increased across the segment. Comp sales for the quarter were up 7.4%, on top of a 7.8% increase for quarter 2 \u201907, and operating income increased 13% in constant currencies.  Europe\u2019s overarching strategies of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency, and enhancing local relevance continues to deliver results. European customers are embracing our three-tier menu approach.  From the launch of the premium M burger in France and Germany to expansion of the Petit Plaisir value platform to countries like Portugal, Switzerland, and Italy, we are offering products that meet consumers\u2019 needs regardless of how much is in their wallet.  We also expect convenience will continue to drive business. More than 70% of our European restaurants offer some form of extended hours. Comparable sales during these hours are outpacing the rest of the day and we continue to leverage this opportunity. In addition, nearly half of our European restaurants now have drive-thrus and drive-thrus represent 45% of sales in those restaurants. And given our track record in the U.S., we believe this business will continue to grow at accelerated rates.  Reimaging is another key component of our strategy. Since the beginning of 2003, Europe has reimaged over 2,000 restaurants to provide a more relevant and contemporary experience for customers. Germany continues to make progress against its goal of reimaging all of its restaurants by the end of 2009. Many of these include a McCaf\u00e9, a separate upscale area that offers specialty coffee and desserts. These contemporary additions are helping build our credibility as a coffee destination.  The U.K. is also planning to reimage another 200-plus restaurants in 2008 and 2009, with an emphasis on our drive-thru locations now. It is important to note that our business in the U.K. remains strong. Even in spite of declining consumer confidence in the U.K., our sales, our guest counts, and our margins continued to grow in the second quarter and were a strong contributor to our overall results. We are optimistic about the European business and especially our big three markets of France, Germany, and the U.K., which represent two-thirds of our operating income in Europe.  At the same time, we will keep an eye towards Russia, Europe\u2019s high potential market, where we are in our fifth year of consecutive double-digit monthly comp sales growth. With 143 million people but only 195 McDonald's restaurants today, Russia remains a significant growth opportunity.  We are confident our emphasis on convenience, menu choice, and value will continue to meet the changing and growing demands of the European consumer.  Now let\u2019s turn to APMEA. We delivered an outstanding quarter, with comparable sales up 8.8% on top of a 10.9% increase in second quarter last year, and operating income increased 22% in constant currencies. Margins are up, income growth remains strong, and returns have increased significantly during the last three years.  These results have been driven by strong performances in Australia and China, and positive results in most other markets. Australia continued to deliver impressive results. Their recent introduction of Crispy Chicken across all price points has been very successful, exceeding our expectations. This market success is also the result of our continued focus on operations improvement and momentum at breakfast, driven by Espresso Pronto coffee and a series of menu extensions. And Australia is seeing the benefit of having reimaged nearly all of their restaurants, with the majority including a McCaf\u00e9.  In Japan, sales and guest counts continued to grow, despite a flat and formal eating out market. We are taking market share. The addition of several new items to the YEN100 menu, including premium roast coffee, chicken, and desserts is resonating with our customers, and it\u2019s even easier for customers to go to a McDonald's that\u2019s open when they want it -- more than 1300 restaurants in Japan are now open 24 hours.  Now turning to China, one of our high potential markets, we are quickly scaling best practice initiatives, including extended hours, breakfast, and value. Today nearly three-quarters of China\u2019s restaurants are open 24 hours. Comps continue to grow during these hours and we expect that trend to continue. The benefit of extended hours can also be seen in our breakfast business, which has grown to 7% of China\u2019s sales, a 50% increase since the launch in early 2007. We expect this day part will continue to grow as customers discover the great taste and convenience of breakfast at McDonald's.  As we approach the Beijing Summer Olympics, excitement continues to build. In addition to the four restaurants that we built to feed the athletes, media, and many spectators, our 942 local restaurants are also sharing in the fun with games and food promotions. The Olympics are a great opportunity to support the world\u2019s greatest athletes, while celebrating our people and building our brand. We are proud to be a part of it.  One last topic that is generating a great deal of interest is commodity cost. Like everyone today, we are experiencing significant increases. However, we believe we have a competitive advantage in both our ability to leverage economies of scale and our global supply chain. Our menu is also very diversified -- no single commodity makes up more than 15% of our overall food bill. And our margins are among the highest in the industry, and they are bringing significant dollars to the system.  Our globally diversified business is an unparalleled advantage. It positions us to deliver in all types of operating environments. I am pleased that we have been able to grow market share and maintain high margins in this environment. Our strength continues as the global comparable sales trend is even stronger in July than in June, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver results as we manage the business for the long-term.  And with that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. \nPeter J. Bensen: Thank you, Ralph and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, our global business has delivered strong quarterly results. Consolidated margins are up, we\u2019re controlling G&A, and earnings as well as returns are strong. All in all, I am very pleased with these results.  Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.04, a 44% increase after adjusting for the impact of the 2007 Latin America transaction. These results included a $160 million non-operating gain, or $0.10 per share from the previously announced sale of our minority interest in Pret A Manger, a U.K. based quick-service sandwich concept.  Strong comparable sales increases around the world helped drive total margin dollars to $2.2 billion in the second quarter, up 5% in constant currencies. Franchise margins represented about two-thirds of this amount and accounted for nearly all of the increase.  As a percent of revenues, franchise margins increased 80 basis points to 82.3%. This percentage benefited from last year\u2019s Latin America transaction but was partly offset by the impact of our refranchising strategy. Let me clarify that last point. Since a significant number of our locations around the world are situated on lease sites, as we refranchise restaurants we are transferring more lease sites into our franchise restaurant portfolio. This impacts margin percentages because lease expense and occupancy costs shifts from company-operated to franchise margins.  For owned sites, there is no corresponding operating expense for the land. Accordingly, although our franchise margin dollars grow and the stability of our cash flow improves as a result of refranchising, our franchise margin percent is negatively impacted. The impact on company-operated margins is just the opposite.  Company-operated margins as a percent of sales rose 10 basis points to 17.7%, driven primarily by strong sales growth worldwide, offset by rising commodity and other costs. Before going into company-operated margins by area of the world, let me discuss how we look to optimize margins over the long-term.  We use a multi-faceted approach on both the sales and cost side of the margin equation. On the sales side, we\u2019ve been successful at driving customer visits and increasing market share as we balance price and product offerings. Our strategic approach to menu price adjustments considers consumer sensitivity, as well as the local competitive and economic environments.  And by offering a three-tiered menu featuring relevant value, core, and premium products, with each tier receiving appropriate marketing support, we enhance sales and profits.  For example, in the U.S., our current national Big Mac promotion, at regular price, I might add, complements a local market focus on attractively priced beverages. This balance helps drive traffic and delivers solid margin performance.  On the cost side, productivity and commodities are key areas of focus. We continuously work to enhance the efficiency of our restaurant operations. This includes leveraging new diagnostic tools to enhance restaurant profitability, breakfast and drive-thru optimization efforts, and introducing new equipment, such as a fryer that uses less oil and energy.  As for food, we managed our grocery bill like a portfolio, seeking to achieve the best overall results. Our goal here is to remain competitive and predictable.  Our comprehensive approach to restaurant profitability and margins, incorporating price, product mix, and cost management, gives us flexibility to continue to optimize performance around the world. This approach has proven successful, as exemplified by the U.S., where we continue to deliver company-operated margins that are among the best in the industry. U.S. company-operated margins were strong at 19.1%, down 40 basis points from last year, primarily due to cost headwinds that offset solid comparable sales and guest count growth.  For the quarter, beef cost in the U.S. rose 2% and chicken was up 6%. For the full year, our outlook for chicken is to rise in that same 5% to 6% range, and for beef to increase 8% to 9%.  We will continue to focus on driving customer visits while maximizing the benefit of strategic price adjustments to deliver strong margins and operator cash flow.  Moving on to Europe, strong comparable sales growth contributed to company-operated margins of 18%, the same high level as last year. Our robust sales performance was offset by inflationary commodity and labor cost pressures throughout Europe. For the second quarter, beef prices in Europe rose 6% and chicken increased 8%. Our full year \u201908 commodity outlook is for chicken to be up 7% to 8% and beef costs to rise 8% to 9%.  Despite growing unease over the European economy, we are confident we can continue to drive sales and traffic while effectively managing the cost side of the margin equation.  In APMEA, continued strong comparable sales in virtually every country contributed to the company-operated margins rising 140 basis points. Australia led this performance with its new chicken offerings and longer operating hours, helping to extend its string of double-digit comp sales increased to 12 months. China also performed well in the quarter, with double-digit comparable sales increases and margin expansion. Breakfast, extended hours, and relevant promotions contributed to this result.  G&A control continues to be an area of focus across the entire organization. In the second quarter, G&A was up 1%, but declined 3% in constant currencies, as lower expenses in Latin America offset costs related to our biannual worldwide owner-operator convention.  And we continue to generate a significant amount of cash, and repurchased nearly $800 million of stock and paid a dividend of $420 million in the quarter.  On a final note, we continue to make progress toward our goal of refranchising 1,000 to 1,500 restaurants over the next few years. In the first half of this year, nearly 300 company-operated restaurants were franchised, bring the worldwide percentage of franchised restaurants to 79%.  As we continue to become more heavily franchised, combined operating margin becomes a more appropriate measure of our overall business profitability. Not surprisingly, this improved significantly, rising 320 basis points, excluding impairment and other charges, to 26.7% in the first half of 2008.  This quarter\u2019s strong results are a testament to our global strategy, the Plan-to-Win and its ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. The Plan-to-Win grounds us in what matters most to our customers and creates a framework nimble enough to adapt to their ever-changing needs and preferences. I am confident that as we continue to execute against this framework, our customers, the system, and our investors will continue to benefit.  Thank you. Now I will turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A. \nMary Kay Shaw: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Steve West, Stifel Nicolaus.\nSteve West - Stifel Nicolaus: I just had a quick question on -- maybe a clarification on the commodities. You are talking about the commodities being up about 2% as far as the beef in the second quarter. On your outlook for \u201908, you talk about the beef in the U.S. being up 8% to 9%, but last quarter you talked about it being up about flat. Can you talk about what the big difference is that happened in the quarter that made you change your outlook so much? Thanks. \nPeter J. Bensen: We\u2019ve seen a lot of volatility in the beef market. Some of it we think is short-term but there\u2019s been a spike recently. We\u2019ve seen Russia ban exports from Latin America. That\u2019s causing Russia to buy more U.S. beef and generally, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity with the weaker dollar in countries wanting to buy U.S. beef, so it\u2019s putting a lot more pressure.  We expected Russia to come into the U.S. market some time next year but this has happened a little bit sooner, so it\u2019s a few things that have hit us relatively recently and beef is 15% of our mix in the U.S. and we feel confident our supply chain will mitigate the impact as best they can. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Dave Palmer at UBS. \nDavid Palmer - UBS: Congratulations on the first half of the year. I wanted to ask you about your earnings algorithm, so to speak. You signaled something, maybe it was a year ago when you first started telling us to focus on overall profit margins and dollars, and for our modeling purposes, and I know internally you think pretty far out, should we think that there is a change in your earnings algorithm going forward where your company restaurant margins are relatively stable, even as you execute the game plan in the U.S. and Europe, and you are really left leveraging the overhead to drive earnings. Is that what\u2019s kind of broadly going on here?\nMary Kay Shaw: Pete, do you want to take a stab at that one?\nPeter J. Bensen: David, I think essentially when last November we shifted toward a view of the combined operating margin, essentially that was an acknowledgement that as we have fewer and fewer company-operated restaurants, those margins become less and less a driver of our profitability, and that as you indicated, as we are rebalancing the portfolio and shifting toward a more franchise organization, looking at the impact of our total operating income, which also includes our focus on controlling G&A spending is probably the best way to look at it. So I think that\u2019s a fair way to say. \nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman. \nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. I was wondering if we could just drill down a little bit more into Europe. Given the very strong 7.4% same-store sales for the quarter, margins at the company level flat year over year, I was wondering if you could just drill down and talk a little bit about how did traffic develop in the same-store sales? Was there a negative year-over-year mix shift, maybe a little bit more on the value menu which pressured margins, and is there a disparity between the company same-store sales and the franchise same-store sales, which may be pressuring or keeping the company margins at bay?\nMary Kay Shaw: Ralph, do you want to take that one?\nRalph Alvarez: We were very aggressive in Europe this year, making sure that we continued to drive traffic, so traffic is about half of the sales and that\u2019s where we want it. The margins being flat, we had slightly more impact on the commodity costs in Europe in the second quarter than we did in the U.S. But the other thing you have in Europe is labor rates change as inflation goes up, many of those mandated by government. And so you had, and it\u2019s in our comments, both labor and cost pressures that increase those. And we saw a little bit more of that even in our market in Russia, which is all company. So still very strong margins but our goal actually for the quarter was to try to be at about flat margins because of the amount of market share we are taking. Our company restaurant sales versus franchise are pretty close. That\u2019s not the reason for any kind of difference. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley, Banc of America. \nJoe Buckley - Banc of America: Thank you. I wanted to go back to the commodity comments again. If beef is going to be up 8% to 9% full year in both the U.S. and Europe, what does that imply for the second half? And maybe in conjunction with that, if you could talk about pricing in -- well, I guess in the U.S. because Europe might be too complicated across so many markets. \nPeter J. Bensen: Obviously you hit it that the beef costs will be higher the second half of the year than we experienced in the first half, and again we have a lot of confidence that our supply chain folks will help to mitigate the impact as best they can, but the reality that we are all dealing with is that we expect them to be higher in the second half of the year.  In terms of pricing in the U.S., we look to that food away from home index as kind of a guiding point to not exceed when we are doing menu price increases, and we use a strategic pricing tool to tell us which items we can do and which are going to have the least amount of impact on transactions and traffic growth. So for the -- through June, our pricing in the U.S. has been up a little over 4%, and that is below the food away from home index in the U.S.  As you mentioned Europe, it gets a little harder with 40 countries but with the exception of Russia where Ralph indicated inflation is maybe a little bit higher there, we are in the 2% to 4% range around the major countries around Europe. \nRalph Alvarez: Just to add on the pricing there, Joe, there is no doubt -- you know, we see that food away from home number continues to grow because of what\u2019s going on with the grocery bill. Still, food away from home is significantly below what the cost of groceries are in the grocery store and that provides price elasticity. And we have been able to take that on a pretty regular basis, and so I think you will see a little bit more of that.  The other piece we\u2019ve done in the U.S. is if you look at our marketing calendar here the last three, four months, it\u2019s been full margin chicken sandwiches and full margin Big Macs, while still having the strong value underpinning but making sure that we do that also as we go through. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Lehman Brothers.\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thank you. Shifting gears to the coffee program rollout, which has gotten a lot of attention of late, I think, Ralph, you mentioned being pleased with both the premium drip and the specialty coffee thus far. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give a little more color in terms of perhaps the best and the worst markets. I know it\u2019s still early on but kind of high level, perhaps a discussion on what it would actually take to break even. I know you gave certain sales expectations. Perhaps some franchisee thoughts, just kind of get a feel for how the program is going, perhaps the pace of growth over the next 12 months. Thanks. \nRalph Alvarez: Again, it\u2019s gotten more press than it deserves, to tell you the truth. We\u2019re in 1,600 restaurants on the specialty coffee side. That is only one piece of the combined beverage business. That\u2019s why we call it that. There\u2019s sweet iced tea, there\u2019s the iced coffee, there\u2019s smoothies, there\u2019s frappes, there\u2019s bottled drinks, and some other pieces to that that make us a destination for beverages. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re after.  And then within that is a complete change to our drive-thru booth and operations so that we can deliver our current menu better, which has grown a lot, and this beverage menu, and in a labor efficient way. So that\u2019s really the whole piece and as far as the specialty coffee items, right now we are tracking ahead of what we projected in the test markets that we are in. Specialty coffees, the hot specialty coffees are seasonal, so in the summer you are not going to sell as much as you do in the winter. So if you had our sales now and you see what we are selling in sweet tea and iced coffee and the cold beverages, of course that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our -- is part of what\u2019s driving our business and that\u2019s the balance that we are looking for as we go forward.  We\u2019re very excited about this whole piece as a combination to everything else we do, but coffee is only one piece of that and specialty coffee is only one piece of the coffee equation. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Glass at Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: -- a couple of times your advantage of the size of your supply chain in keeping costs lower than peers. Can you give some specific examples of that? Are you just pushing more of your costs back to your suppliers, or are you able to source globally, for example, for the U.S.? What is it other than just scale that makes your supply chain different maybe than your peers?\nPeter J. Bensen: I\u2019ll give you a little perspective, for example, from last year. The basket of goods that we buy for our restaurants, the produce price index for that basket was up 8.5% and we experienced back door increases of less than 4% to our restaurants. So how does the supply chain accomplish that? It\u2019s a variety of things. It\u2019s working with suppliers to strategically hedge certain items. It\u2019s locking in to some fixed cost contracts that can help preserve the cost. It\u2019s working with suppliers to maybe rationalize and consolidate facilities. It\u2019s looking at opportunities to purchase in different parts of the world where we maybe before were just purchasing something locally.  So it\u2019s a variety. A lot of these suppliers have been suppliers to McDonald's for several years and leveraging those relationships in these various ways is a very effective way and in the primary way that our supply chain accomplishes this. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets: If I could just follow-up on that question and then ask a question; what I\u2019m particularly interested in is how you guys buy beef and chicken, and if you can remind me how you do that, and is there any kind of step functionality with corn, because corn is usually rolling over a little bit?  And then the second part of that question is that you had given us some guidance on what it would take in terms of comps in the U.S. and Europe to run flat margins. Can you update that given the increase in commodity costs? Thanks.  \nPeter J. Bensen: Larry, I\u2019ll answer the comp piece first and then maybe Ralph will give you some more texture on how we buy beef around the world, but we used to say 2% to 3% was about the comp that we needed to hold margins or grow margins, and that was in a normal commodity environment which obviously we\u2019re not in, and so we\u2019re probably double that amount now in terms of our need to grow comps but we\u2019re confident that with our ability to go to the menu board and the price elasticity we have and our supply chain that\u2019s working on controlling those costs, that we\u2019ll continue to look at this and balance the equation as best we can. \nRalph Alvarez: On the beef and chicken, we do it differently in different places but those are both commodities that we more and more have become vertically integrated, with suppliers that take it from -- basically from farm to final processing. We also aggregate our commodity cost buys from different countries and then our processing suppliers take advantage of that combined buy that we did for the system as a whole.  These are our two most important proteins that we buy and we have really gone to consolidating processing plants, consolidating all the way back in the food chain and we believe that\u2019s a significant strength for our system. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. I believe you touched on it a bit, Ralph, just on the value menu outlook for the U.S. I have to think that with the price increases going on across the restaurant landscape that the value menu has got to be more and more attractive, and I would imagine you are seeing some mix down to that. I\u2019m just wondering what your thoughts are there. I mean, how close you guys may be to changing the pricing on that and if you see that as a major pressure point as we move forward here. \nRalph Alvarez: Jason, the surprising piece is we have not had -- the value menu has not, the percentage of sales has not grown significantly but the cost implications of having that value menu have, when you see what\u2019s going on with beef and chicken. And so we\u2019ve been out there testing. There\u2019s more elasticity. You know, the way dollar menu looks today won\u2019t be the way it\u2019s going to look next year. In this current environment, we\u2019ve got to make sure we are pricing smart, not just pricing low. But we\u2019ve got numerous tests out there with franchisees. We\u2019ve got consumer research and we\u2019ll make the move at some point when we know how to make that move in a way that continues to drive traffic. And during these times, continuing to grow traffic is the most important piece and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on. But you\u2019ll see some -- there will be some type of change in what that looks like and our U.S. team is hard at work on that.  We have a lot of experience with this around the world because we have more -- other places that are much more inflationary and so we\u2019ve got a pretty good understanding on how to move from our experiences in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe, J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I did have a question on bridge specifically in Europe, the bridge operating platform. Just an update in terms of where that is in the rollout, if it\u2019s nearing completion and just in terms of company stores, I mean, if there\u2019s any margin benefit that might be possible from that system as we move in \u201908 and \u201909. \nRalph Alvarez: The bridge operating platform is the kitchen platform that we are doing in Europe. We\u2019re 70%, 75% completed, and the major countries will be done by mid-\u201909. Some of the countries are almost completely done.  The biggest benefit to the bridge operating platform is not labor efficiency but it\u2019s ability to handle more menu complexity, and so the chicken strategies that we\u2019ve been so successful with, along with some of the beef products that we are working -- if you go to Europe now, in some cases we can only do those promotional because we can\u2019t sustain that complex a menu in our old kitchen, and so that\u2019s the biggest benefit that we get, the operational improvements and the flexibility to continue to have a more diverse menu. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Tom [Fort] from Telsey Advisory Group.\nTom Fort - Telsey Advisory Group: Thank you. Can you talk a little about the pricing environment, as far as the competition goes? I know for example in the QSR space, someone rolled out a lower price point value menu. In addition, I feel like there\u2019s a lot more promotions going on that involve free product. So can you talk a little about the competition there and how that may or may not affect your efforts?\nRalph Alvarez: We look at having balanced, attractive pricing throughout the menu. If you look, we do limited one-time discounts and have been for the last six years, and that\u2019s why we believe so strongly in one of our drivers being a branded affordability everyday predictable low prices is the key.  Others are jumping in and out of discounts and we prefer to have something that our regular customers get to experience every day, and it\u2019s working, and it\u2019s working and we see it in our trend lines and in our guest count growth. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Difrisco from Oppenheimer.\nMatt Difrisco - Oppenheimer: My question is with respect to the U.S. comp. I\u2019m a little confused. I think you said earlier in the call that 75% of the same-store sales gain was traffic driven, yet pricing is around 4%, so I guess there must be a negative mix shift going on in there but you are not seeing a significant move in percent of sales toward the value meal, or towards the dollar meal?\nRalph Alvarez: There\u2019s a few factors that work in there, Matt. One is our breakfast business is growing faster than our rest of day, and breakfast is a lower average check than rest of day. Second is our growth in beverages, which has been a big focus for us, is also a lower average check because in some cases, those beverages don\u2019t come with a full meal, depending on what time of day it is. And so that also gives a little depression.  And lastly, in general, even with our full price menu items that we\u2019ve been advertising, we have not been focused on our most expensive items during these economic times. So all those items create a little bit of a shift down, even if it isn\u2019t a significant move up on dollar menu. And we think that\u2019s been healthy. We\u2019ve taken the price increases, as we mentioned in that 4% range, and that helps the margins but not necessarily do we want our average check to go up by that during these times. \nPeter J. Bensen: And Matt, just to clarify one point -- Ralph talked about the 75% coming from traffic. That was the quarter. For the year-to-date, it\u2019s about 60% of the comp was driven by traffic, so 60% year-to-date is more in line with the 4% price increase. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: Can you guys talk a little bit about the structural changes that you are making to the drive-thru and how that will help you improve your speed of service, or as you said, run the restaurant more efficiently? Maybe are there any opportunities for you to do more extended hours or what specifically are the changes to the drive-thru and how will they impact your business? Thanks. \nRalph Alvarez: As our drive-thru business has grown over the years, it really is one of the places we have not done a lot of change in the actual drive-thru booth. So our changes are about making the booth almost self-sustaining to be able to deliver the products that are there. Today, in many cases, you\u2019ve got to walk 10, 15 steps to go get a different type of drink, a salad because we don\u2019t have refrigeration right there, we have it on the front counter -- you know, all those items, and then as you add these new beverages, the only space we would normally have would have been to put those behind the front counter. And again, it\u2019s not efficient for drive-thru.  So what we do is we take the drive-thru, we optimize it. We put in drink systems on the carbonated side that make drinks automatically right off the register when it\u2019s rung up and then for the rest of the items, literally somebody only has to move a step or two to make every beverage we have, or to pick up a sandwich or to pick up French fries. And so it\u2019s that efficiency that will give us both productivity and order accuracy improvements as we go forward. So that\u2019s the piece we\u2019re doing.  As far as the open extended hours, et cetera, it\u2019s not a benefit that way other than productivity wise, again we end up being much more efficient with a much tighter space to work in. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser - Buckingham: Thanks very much. First on the commodities, the last quarter and previous to that, you did mention cheese. Could you give us an update on your cheese cost outlook?\nPeter J. Bensen: Sure, Mitch. In the U.S. for the year, we think cheese is going to be up about 21%, and in Europe we think about 25%. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.\nAnalyst for Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse: This is actually Karen [Holstat] on the call for Keith. Looking at the Southern Style Chicken, it seems like there was a pretty significant marketing push behind that in May, and we were just curious how sales have trended since that marketing has tapered off?\nRalph Alvarez: We did -- again, this was a product rollout that was both for breakfast and lunch, and so it got even more of a significant push, especially the breakfast side of the equation, where chicken and breakfast is something that was not as common on two-thirds of the country. And so the performance of both sandwiches have exceeded our expectations and our sales trends are strong. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Paul Westra at Cowen.\nPaul Westra - Cowen & Company: Good afternoon. Most questions asked and answered, but Pete, if you can clarify your comments on the -- I guess the PTI inflation rate of some of the products and what your spread is for your back-of-the-house actual costs. My question is your guidance for beef of up 8% to 9% or so here, is that the commodity cost or is that your back-of-the-house expectation? And then related, given the double-digit spike we expect here, I guess, or you are implying in the second half, is that going to -- is it safe to assume that\u2019s going to lead you to take probably more pricing that you would have normally?\nPeter J. Bensen: Paul, just to clarify, that 8% to 9% I was talking about is our expectation of our backdoor costs right now. But again, this is a volatile market and hopefully that won\u2019t all come true but that\u2019s what we see right now.  And as Ralph mentioned, this is a component of everybody\u2019s grocery bills going up and in that environment, there\u2019s probably a little more price elasticity. But at the end of the day, beef is 15% of our product mix, so while it\u2019s an issue and it\u2019s something that we will watch after, it\u2019s not -- there\u2019s a whole other part of the business that\u2019s not impacted by that; our breakfast business, our chicken business, et cetera. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Omohundro at Wachovia.\nJeff Omohundro - Wachovia Capital Markets: I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us an update on the China development outlook and in particular, perhaps an update on Sinopec and how they are contributing? Thanks. \nRalph Alvarez: Our China development is going well. As we have said earlier in the year that we would open 125 restaurants this year, we will hit that number, probably exceed it. The first half of the year, we have a much more balanced number of openings coming across. We opened 18 restaurants in June, as an example. And so it\u2019s contributing well.  Sinopec continues to be a piece of our development but it\u2019s not a significant piece of all those openings that we are doing, because those deals take longer to work out, you know, both companies having to develop the site and getting the drive-thru permits and so forth. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Howard Penny at Research Edge.\nHoward Penny - Research Edge: Thanks very much. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that expectations from McDonald's senior management was for 2% to 3% comp growth, and Pete, you alluded to earlier that you needed 5 to maintain margins. Is that a number that you can maintain, that 5% comp growth? And then secondly, just on the discounting in coupons, there was a fairly healthy drop of coupons. I think you called it a crave and save here in the Northeast where you are getting two for one, buy one get one free Big Mac and a few other products. Was that a national thing or was that just local here in the north? Thanks. \nPeter J. Bensen: Howard, the coupons are definitely a local thing, so as you know, 60% or so of our advertising in the U.S. is done in our local advertising co-ops and they use various techniques to respond to local competitive and economic situations, so -- and really, because we are 85% franchised in the U.S., a lot of those co-op decisions are made by the franchisees.  Regarding comps, you know, we have given our long-term outlook at to gross sales, 3% to 5% with half of that being from comps. And again, that\u2019s a long-term look over time. That doesn\u2019t contemplate the commodity environment and the inflationary environments that we are finding ourselves in in certain of these markets. So to the extent that -- we still think that\u2019s the right model for us to look at and the right targets to be looking at, but certainly in times when all costs are going up significantly, I think our expectations will increase as the costs are increasing significantly.  So it\u2019s really not \u201908 guidance, it\u2019s not a specific year\u2019s guidance, but it\u2019s just a longer term look at how we think about the business. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Thanks. Some other global consumer companies have seen some slowing in consumption in places like Eastern Europe, and one would expect to see in places like the U.K. and Germany, some changes in consumer patterns. Are you seeing anything that has you standing more vigilant these days in markets like this? Any change in buying patterns? And to the degree that you are maintaining traffic growth, what do you think is working for you these days? Thanks. \nRalph Alvarez: We have not seen a slowdown, but are very vigilantly looking at it because economic conditions affect business. Our business is strong in the U.K., in Eastern Europe, and I believe it\u2019s a combination of the fact that we have put in strong, predictable, branded affordability and we have good mix of promotions across the different price ranges. Plus in those different marketplaces, we significantly improve the quality of our restaurants and our operations, and that\u2019s given our brand -- if you look at our brand scores in the U.K., they\u2019ve gone up significantly and that\u2019s definitely changed the trajectory of our sales trendline. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. Another question from Larry Miller at RBC. \nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets: Ralph, can you talk about how the franchisees might feel? You know, they are clearly getting pinched from some of the same cost issues that everyone, and that you are talking about on this call, and how do they feel about getting behind some of these larger programs to drive sales over the next year to two years? What are they telling you?\nRalph Alvarez: Well, they are concerned, and rightly so. We\u2019re seeing commodity cost increases that we haven\u2019t seen in a lot of years, so the balance of being able to take price increases on a more regular basis but still below what\u2019s happening out there, and doing that well is something that luckily, we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at over the last two, three years.  From a promotional point of view, we\u2019ve got to be much more careful in balancing, driving traffic while maintaining margins and that\u2019s the work that we are doing with the franchisees, and then eventually still having a very strong branded affordability menu but what sits on that menu will look different than now because it has to be profitable.  The number one metric we look at for health of the system is individual restaurant guest count growth and profitability, because as a franchisor with 80% of your restaurants franchised, those two things have to be growing for the brand to be doing well and for your franchisees to continue to invest. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. A question from Tom Fort from Telsey.\nTom Fort - Telsey Advisory Group: Thanks for taking my second question. You said before that the challenging economic environment in the U.S. that in past times has meant perhaps a drag of comps of 100 basis points to 200 basis points, and I wanted to know if there was anything different about the current weakness that would suggest that maybe the drag is higher than 200 basis points?\nRalph Alvarez: On what, Tom? I\u2019m sorry, drag on our comp sales?\nMary Kay Shaw: I think what he\u2019s talking about is what we said in -- I think it was the year-end call, maybe. We said we thought the economy might hurt us by one to two points. \nRalph Alvarez: Let me answer that. I think what\u2019s different in these for now in the current situation is unemployment is still not a big number, and that\u2019s one of the most important things for the economy, so people are employed, yes. There\u2019s other issues of inflationary pressures and some of the other items that are affecting disposable income, but in general we are pretty close to full employment and because we are such a strong price value, combined with for us, dealing with the gas price piece, the fact that we are very close to our customers with our distribution, we\u2019re not seeing the impact that we would have seen in previous years during times I guess when you would have had a higher unemployment and maybe not the ability to pass on cost increases. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Another question from Jason West at Deutsche. \nJason West - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. I just want to follow-up again on the beef question, just give the magnitude of the change on the outlook there. How fluid is that number, given that corn has come back a lot? I think some of the spot beef pricing has come down a bit -- I mean, could that number come back down pretty significantly over the next few months, or is that now more of a locked in number for the rest of the year?\nPeter J. Bensen: Jason, that is not a locked in number for the rest of the year. We constantly get updates on these costs and they move as the markets move in some of these cases. So like I said, I\u2019m hopeful maybe they\u2019ll come back but the reality is sitting here today, this is our best look at what we think for the rest of the year. \nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, we have one last question, another repeat from Mitch Speiser.\nMitch Speiser - Buckingham: Just another question on food costs -- any thoughts about the O&I cost outlook? Several or a few restaurant companies out there have said expect more of the same in \u201909. Are you seeing the same thing? And if I could just slip in a second question, with that 4% pricing in the U.S., is that just the company-owned stores? Any comments on what maybe generally franchisee pricing is? Is it above that level or below? Thank you. \nPeter J. Bensen: In terms of \u201909 costs, Mitch, we aren\u2019t ready to predict what\u2019s going to happen to pricing in \u201909. Things are pretty volatile but I would say that I think the -- after going through a long period of relatively stable food costs, that our expectation is that this higher level of commodity and food cost is probably with us for the foreseeable future. A good part of this is being drive by global supply and demand that will take a little while to settle out.  I know there is some -- there are some financial speculators that are in some of these markets but a good part of this is the overall global supply and demand that will probably be with us for a little bit. \nRalph Alvarez: The pricing, the number we quote is system, both company and franchise and our price increases between the two of us are pretty comparable, actually. \nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, thanks. We are out of questions and about out of time, so I\u2019ll go ahead and turn it over to Ralph for a few closing comments. \nRalph Alvarez: Thanks again for joining us this afternoon. As we said, we are pleased with our strong performance for the second quarter and remain optimistic about our ability to deliver results for the remainder of 2008 and beyond. Thank you and have a great day. \nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks a lot.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on our call today are Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner; Chief Financial Officer, Pete Benson; and joining us for Q&A will be Ralph Alvarez, our Chief Operating Officer. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always, forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available on investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks, Mary Kay and good morning. I am pleased to report that the fundamental strength of our global business continues. In the first quarter, comparable sales increased 7.4%, consolidated company operated and franchise margins grew for the 9th consecutive quarter, and earnings per share were up $0.81, or were $0.81, a 31% increase from the first quarter last year. So a great quarter in which every area of the world contributed. Let\u2019s begin with this quarter\u2019s system leader, Europe. Our second-largest business unit delivered first quarter comparable sales of 11.1%. We are pleased with our results across the markets and in particular with the continuing strong performance in the U.K., France, and Germany. The European Plan to Win strategies of strengthening local relevance, upgrading the customer and employee experience, and building greater brand transparency continued to deliver results. The local relevance strategy is being executed across Europe, mainly through the menu. A balance of premium products, classic favorites, and everyday affordable items that appeal to local taste has been very successful, and we are excited about a new premium burger call the M that we recently launched in France and Germany. To support our menu strategy, implementation of the bridge operating platform continues. It is currently in more than 3,500 restaurants and markets around Europe, including France, Germany, and the U.K., and we expect it will be in most all markets or all restaurants by the end of 2009. Initiatives to upgrade the customer experience include our ongoing reimaging efforts. U.K. began two years ago by reimaging the majority of their heavily traveled High Street locations. In 2008, they will reimage 200 more restaurants with an emphasis on those with drive-thrus. And Germany will continue their aggressive reimaging program with the goal of having 100% of our German restaurants reimaged by the end of 2009. Convenience initiatives also enhanced the customer experience. Today\u2019s buys consumer expects and needs us to be available on their terms. Currently about 70% of our restaurants in Europe offer some type of extended hours. As we further build our breakfast business, we have significant opportunity to increase the number of restaurants opening earlier and with only about 600 restaurants open 24 hours, this will be a major area of focus. And lastly, Europe has done an exceptional job building brand transparency and gaining trust in the marketplace. Whether we are willing -- whether we are telling our quality story, setting the facts straight regarding employment, or supporting green initiatives, we are visible and in touch with our customers. Now moving on to our business in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, significant momentum continues with a 9.4% increase in comparable sales for the first quarter. Nearly all markets contributed to this increase. Initiatives around value, convenience, breakfast, and core menu will continue to drive results. Let me highlight just a few of these initiatives and how they are working in our top three markets. Starting with China, we are excited by how quickly successful initiatives are being scaled and executed. For example, in the area of convenience, about 75% of China\u2019s restaurants are open 24 hours and we are seeing very strong comps during these extended hours and expect that to continue into the future. In addition, we\u2019ve seen significant growth in our breakfast business. We have an opportunity to grow this day part exponentially when you consider that many of our existing customers have yet to discover breakfast at McDonald's. It\u2019s a huge opportunity that we are well-positioned to optimize and leverage. Australia continues to deliver strong comp sales growth. The launch of our premium chicken strategy in November of \u201907 has been extremely successful, with results far exceeding our expectations. And we are on pace to double our chicken business in Australia in just three years, plus we\u2019ve added addition convenience with 24 hours in more than 30% of restaurants and improved drive-thru operations are also contributing to this market\u2019s results. In Japan, our momentum continues. New food news on the 100 YEN value menu and the McWrap on the breakfast menu have proven popular with customers. And Japan now has more than 1300 restaurants on 24-hours with more scheduled to go on this year. Turning to the United States, we delivered solid comparable sales for the quarter of 2.9%. [For three months], we did see some ebb and flow in sales, partly as a result of the current economic environment and play on days because of the Easter shift. While March\u2019s comparable sales were down slightly, we estimate April comparable sales will improve to about 2% to 2.5%. In this environment, our strategy of everyday affordability becomes even more important and we will continue to emphasize our value offerings. As we\u2019ve said before, we believe our U.S. business is not recession proof but it is recession resistant. That\u2019s why I remain confident in our ability to manage through these economic times and most important, so do our operators. This past week I had an opportunity to meet with many of them and I am pleased to say that while they too feel the impact of this environment, they are also optimistic about the business now and into the future. I also want to point out that while we can and will respond to the current business environment, we continue to manage our business for the long-term. We believe our U.S. growth strategies of chicken, breakfast, beverages, and convenience will continue to deliver results today and into the future. Our important breakfast business continues to thrive. Looking ahead, we are advancing both our breakfast and chicken strategies with the May launch of our new Southern Style Chicken. We will offer a chicken biscuit sandwich at breakfast and a new chicken sandwich the rest of the day. Additionally, this summer we will highlight beverages with an emphasis on building traffic and add-on purchases by promoting McDonald's Sweet Tea and Iced Coffee in conjunction with core menu favorites. And the introduction of specialty coffee continues. We are currently in about 1300 restaurants and expect the rollout to accelerate and pick up pace later in the year. So that\u2019s a look at McDonald's around the world. Our global Plan to Win is working and I am confident our global momentum will continue. I am confident because our globally diversified business positions us to deliver in all types of operating environments. It is an unparalleled advantage for our system and our shareowners. This system strength was on display last week when 13,000 members of our system, owner-operators, suppliers, and company people, gathered for our worldwide convention. Everything about the time we spent together was aimed at growing our business, at getting even better at being better. The 700,000 square foot exhibit floor provided the tools to drive restaurant performance today. We highlighted proven Plan to Win business drivers, including the best strategies to deliver everyday value and predictable affordable prices, the latest new menu items from around the world, best practices to expand and execute our convenience offerings, relevant and contemporary restaurant decors for ongoing reinvestment, and tools and training to continually improve restaurant operations, including a focus on our people and their development at the restaurant level and beyond. The floor also provided a look at future innovations in our pipeline. Specifically, we are focusing resources on increasing restaurant capacity, efficiency, and relevance. But for me, the most exciting part of our convention was the alignment, collaboration and calibration across the system and subsequent idea generation. But most important -- the focus on execution at the restaurant and providing our customers with a better experience. This energy I experienced at our worldwide convention, coupled with our current business momentum, reinforces my confidence in the direction we are heading and my optimism that our global business will continue to deliver on our revenue, income, and return goals. Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Bensen.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. Today we are reaping the benefits of our disciplined customer centered approach to managing our business. This approach is reflected in how we continue to connect with customers to drive sales growth in each area of the world, how we operate our restaurants and collaborate with suppliers to deliver solid margin performance, how we balance our ownership mix to achieve greater local relevance and a more stable revenue stream, and how we leverage the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet to further build our business and return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. Each of these elements requires a long-term focus to sustain our momentum but it all starts with building greater consumer relevance to drive increased visits and sales. Our results for the quarter continued to prove that this is the right approach for McDonald's. Combined operating margins, a measure that captures company operating and franchise margin performance, as well as G&A control, rose nearly four percentage points to 26.1% in the first quarter. Positive comparable sales were the key factor behind the quarter\u2019s strong performance. Company-operated margins as a percent of sales increased 60 basis points, driven by Europe and APMEA. This also included a 20 basis point benefit from the transition of Latin America to a developmental license structure in August 2007. Europe\u2019s 11% comparable sales increase in the quarter helped deliver a 60 basis point increase in company-operated margins. The U.K. and France were the main contributors to Europe\u2019s improvement, partly offset by Russia, where inflationary cost increases were higher than the rest of Europe. Europe achieved this strong result despite continuing labor and commodity cost pressures. Regarding commodity cost in Europe, during the quarter cheese was up 36%, chicken up 3%, while beef declined 4%. For the full year, our outlook for chicken continues to be up 6% to 8% and cheese to be up 20% to 25%. And now we expect beef to be up 3% to 4%. APMEA had an excellent first quarter with comparable sales up 9.4% and company-operated margins up 170 basis points. China and Australia were key drivers of this performance, along with many other markets. I am extremely pleased with the ongoing contributions of this important business segment. U.S. company-operated margins were relatively strong at 17.8%, driven by comparable sales growth of 2.9%. Higher commodity cost more than offset the comp sales increase, netting U.S. margins down 20 basis points for the quarter. In the first quarter, U.S. cheese costs rose about 30% while beef and chicken both increased nearly 4%. For the year, we currently expect U.S. chicken prices to rise 5% to 6%, cheese to be up 13% to 14%, and beef to trend downward and end the year relatively flat. Around the world, we serve a large variety of products -- beef, chicken, fish, eggs, buns, cheese, and many other items. In general, about 75% of our grocery bill is comprised of 10 different commodities, of which no single item individually represents more than 15% of the total. As a result, no single commodity materially impacts margins. Consolidated franchise margins were up 140 basis points in the quarter, also driven by strong global sales. In addition, the 2007 Latin America transaction benefited margin growth by 60 basis points. We believe locally owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage and make us not just a global brand but a locally relevant one as well. To that end, we continue to evolve to a more heavily franchise structure. Today, our worldwide system is 78% franchise, up over four percentage points from first quarter 2007. We expect this percentage will continue to increase as we make progress on our goal to franchise 1,000 to 1,500 company-operated restaurants over the next few years. In the first quarter, we refranchised about 130 restaurants, primarily in our major markets. Our refranchising efforts help us provide customers a more locally relevant experience and while it has direct positive implications for the predictability and reliability of our cash flow, it initially impacts total revenue dollars because we only collect rent and royalty income versus 100% of the restaurant sales. This more stable revenue stream supports our goal to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders from 2007 through 2009. Last year we returned $5.7 billion. In the first quarter, we were opportunistic with our share repurchases, buying back $2 billion in stock. We also paid a quarterly dividend of nearly $430 million. Our ongoing share repurchases and disciplined compensation practices combine to decrease diluted shares outstanding by 57 million shares, or 5% year over year. This decline contributed about six percentage points to the quarter\u2019s EPS growth rate. Looking ahead, we expect our share count will continue to decline and benefit our EPS growth rate. Our commitment to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders is not a barrier to restaurant growth. Our robust global business generated nearly $5 billion of cash from operations in 2007 alone. In addition, our healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating gives us ready access to capital. We demonstrated this in the first quarter when we secured attractive financing earlier than needed to pre-fund certain debt maturing in the second half of the year. As a result, cash and long-term debt will be substantially higher on March 31st than we expect it will be at year-end. Accordingly, our current outlook for interest income and interest expense is higher than initially projected at the beginning of the year. It\u2019s our better, not just bigger strategy that influences our capital expenditure plans. This strategy guides our decision on the amount, location, and nature of our capital investment. In 2008, our planned capital expenditures of $2 billion will be almost equally divided between new restaurant openings and reinvestment, including reimaging and other opportunities such as the combined beverage business in the U.S. We expect to open about 1,000 new restaurants this year, up 20% from the number we built in 2007. This increased number of openings reflects an aggressive 20% to 25% unit growth rate in our high potential markets of Russia and China. So far this year, nearly one-fourth of the 170 locations we\u2019ve added were in China. Our restaurant addition target also includes higher new unit openings in affiliate and developmental license markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where we invest no capital and collect a royalty based on sales. Looking forward, we continue to run our business with disciplined fiscal practices, balancing growth from comparable sales and new units to drive strong cash flow and returns. From ongoing initiatives to deliver great customer experiences to strategies that strengthen cash flow and returns, our disciplined business approach is working. I am confident that as we maintain this focus, we will continue to deliver shareholder value into the future. Thank you. Now I will turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Pete. I\u2019ll now open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Steve West at Stifel Nicolaus.\nSteve West - Stifel Nicolaus:\n :\nJames A. Skinner: Thank you, Steve, for the question. First of all, McCafe is a pretty small part of our overall strategy but I\u2019ll let Ralph talk a little bit about the numbers, if you will, Ralph.\nRalph Alvarez: Steve, we have 1,300 in some version, and this was part of our initial testing and early rollout, so some are in different stages of development. The rest, what we\u2019ve said is will be completed at some point in \u201909. We\u2019re not going to give specific timeframes. It\u2019s a complicated process through zoning and everything else and what we do know is that we\u2019ve done our thorough testing, is that we are hitting or exceeding our targets in different geographies around the country.\nJames A. Skinner: And it\u2019s specialty coffee and not specifically McCafe. I think that\u2019s another distinction that\u2019s important to talk about, is two different strategies, really, specialty coffee and McCafe.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. Can you give us a run-down on check increase versus traffic increase, maybe in the three main regions -- the U.S., Europe, and APMEA please?\nPeter J. Bensen: You know, we had traffic increases across all the segments so that obviously is very good, and it ranged from maybe a little more than a third of our growth came from traffic in the U.S. to close to 50% from traffic in Europe and nearly 60% in APMEA.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Next question, Jeff Bernstein, Lehman Brothers.\nJeff Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. A question on Europe specifically; just looking at the company operating margin line, you\u2019ve got a 60 basis point improvement but yet an extremely impressive 11% plus quarterly comp. The increase I guess in margins is well below the prior three quarters on an absolute basis, as well as just on an incremental basis. I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk about the drivers. I know you mentioned obviously commodities and labor but if you could talk about what you think are the specific drivers for limiting the margin growth, perhaps your outlook on that line, maybe what the U.K. contribution was, that total. Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: You know, we were pleased with the growth we had and the performance across the different segments of Europe. Commodity costs, as you know, and Pete went over, are pretty high. Normally if we had a 3% or so comp, we would cover our costs in Europe but with the higher commodity costs, that number right now for the -- would have been more in the 5-plus range for the first quarter. And we -- so that was part of the reason you did not see a higher performance. Our controls were in line, our strategies were in line. On a secondary basis in Russia, which is becoming a bigger piece of Europe, just the way we do our price increase there, that\u2019s a much more inflationary environment. They don\u2019t always stock up exactly when we get increases, and so the number fluctuates a little bit more quarter to quarter, but we feel we know we\u2019ll be in line by the end of the year.\nPeter J. Bensen: And Jeff, specifically you asked about the U.K., they benefited margins by about 30 basis points in the quarter.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Glass at Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask for a clarification in front of my question; the clarification is just on Easter. In March, it was bad for the U.S. but good for Europe, and then the reverse happens. If you could just clarify that -- in other words, the two markets don\u2019t respond the same to Easter. And then the question is on Europe, could you just in aggregate talk about the number of stores, the percentage of stores, let\u2019s say, in total that have extended operating hours and again the percentage of stores that have been reimaged. You talked about additional hours and additional reimaging, but where are we in total on those two metrics?\nPeter J. Bensen: I\u2019ll talk and clarify the Easter first -- you are correct. It is a negative to the U.S. and a positive to Europe, but the magnitude is much different. In the U.S., it\u2019s less than five-tenths on sales in terms of the Easter impact. But in Europe, it\u2019s more like a 2% impact because a lot more people travel and plan their holidays around Easter in a very concentrated timeframe, so we see a 2% benefit around Easter in Europe and a less than 5% negative in the U.S. around the Easter holiday. Your questions on the extended hours and reimaging --\nRalph Alvarez: I\u2019ll take those.\nPeter J. Bensen: Ralph, you\u2019ve got the numbers?\nRalph Alvarez: John, on extended hours, in Europe we have about 8% of the estate is on 24 hours and we hadn\u2019t done a significant amount of extended hours. As you may know, other than the U.K., we don\u2019t have much of a breakfast business over there except where we started to put McCafes in Germany, so it\u2019s still a pretty big future opportunity for us, both extended and 24-hours. On reimaging, at the end of March, we were close to 2,000 reimaged restaurants of the total restaurants in Europe and planning another 700 or so by the end of this year. And that\u2019s about the pace. We\u2019re on a pace of doing about 800 or so, 900 per year and that allows for the whole estate to stay current on a cycle that\u2019s about a 10-year cycle.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is Jason West, Deutsche.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank: Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the labor cost environment. I know you see a lot of press about food costs but labor was actually more inflationary in the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything specific going on in Europe or the U.S. on the labor line that\u2019s going to roll over here, or is this kind of the way it\u2019s going to be for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: Well, we\u2019ve had some compression on labor, as you know, and our average rate is up significantly in the U.S. and around the world, of course. They never go down. They are always going up and the cost of doing business is increasing. It\u2019s one of the factors relative to our margins, but I\u2019m going to let Ralph talk specifically about the numbers, Jason.\nRalph Alvarez: One thing that throws the number off for the quarter, Jason, is with the refranchising of the Latin America business, which had a big McOpCo base and had a low labor rate, it\u2019s a 90 basis point effect in the quarter on the labor rate, so it kind of throws the number off as having a greater impact than it really does. So that\u2019s something you will need to factor into the numbers and what Jim said on the rest, is what we deal with and we cover the majority of it through price increases just below inflation.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Kron at Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. I had a question on the U.S. margins. On a year-over-year basis down 20 basis points, seems to have held up relatively well compared to what it\u2019s been doing over the last say four quarters, despite maybe the comp being a little bit less. So recognizing commodity cost is certainly inflationary, is there anything that we should be aware from a cost control standpoint with the four walls of the company-operated stores that is helping to protect those margins? It seemed to come in a little bit better than I had anticipated.\nJames A. Skinner: Steve, we do a lot of things to mitigate the cost of increasing commodities, a lot going on in the market place today regarding those costs. And of course we have great work being done by our treasury group and supply chain group to mitigate those costs over time, but we don\u2019t get all of them. And then of course we have our price increases and our pricing tool models to be able to protect our consumer value and at the same time take price increases that are appropriate for the business and our customers. Ralph, maybe you want to talk a little bit about --\nRalph Alvarez: I think in general the margins were predictable across all three months and we also had an emphasis on breakfast, which you know is a high margin business for us. And so overall our long-term strategy of chicken, beverages, and breakfast helps during these times also.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Thank you. Many economists are saying that consumption growth in Europe could slow and some companies have cited there may be some signs of slowing there already. I\u2019m wondering, are you seeing any evidence anywhere in your European business of diminished consumer strength? And to the degree that this occurs, or is occurring, do you see your business there being somewhat more cyclical than the U.S. and perhaps you would make a change in your strategy away from premium innovation to something else. Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for the question, David. Of course, we manage our business for the long-term so I don\u2019t expect to see any change in strategy, that\u2019s to answer your question number three, or the third part of your question. And currently, and I talk with Ralph and the European leadership about this every day to see whether or not we are seeing any slowdown, as others are expecting to see a slowdown in Europe and the answer in our business right now is the only thing we can really look at is that no, the trends currently are very strong and we feel good about where we are there. And I\u2019ll let Ralph talk a little bit about the economy over there. He\u2019s been in all the markets and spent time directly with the leadership, so it might be appropriate for him to comment.\nRalph Alvarez: David, our performance was strong across our four major markets and we are not seeing that effect. And as you know, we\u2019ve had a fairly strong premium product focus. We had good every day value in the marketplace but our new products that we have out there have been good performers and we have a nice balance between average check growth and traffic in the number. Pete mentioned it\u2019s about 50-50 right now in just about all countries, the major countries in Europe. So we are not seeing it. We keep a very close eye on it but we are investing there for the future. We have -- we are building great brand strength?\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jim Baker at Neuberger.\nJim Baker - Neuberger Berman: I have two questions; can you comment on your SG&A expense, where you had a pretty good leveraging of that. And although I am wondering what that might have been sort of on a pro forma basis if you had the Latin America SG&A out of first quarter \u201907. And then separately, could you just comment on the operating income performance of Canada and Latin America separately? Would Latin America have been -- did you benefit from the Lat-Am transaction, or was that a detriment this quarter?\nJames A. Skinner: I\u2019m going to let Pete talk about the details but we feel good about where we are with the G&A and our goal, of course, is to be more efficient and we achieved that in the first quarter and we feel good with what we have ahead of us for the year relative to the G&A. And some of that is being contributed really by the Latin American transaction relative to reduced G&A costs from that segment. Pete, do you want to talk a little bit about the specifics?\nPeter J. Bensen: Jim, you asked if you were to exclude the Latin transaction, G&A would have been up only 3% constant currency, which considering the sales growth we think is a great accomplishment for the first quarter and as we had indicated in our annual guidance, we expect G&A to be down in relative terms for the full year, so this was in line with our expectations and not only reflects the Latin transaction but the ongoing discipline and focus around controlling the G&A. Your second question was around splitting out Latin and Canada and while we are not going to really get into a lot of those details, Latin was relatively flat with the first quarter last year, which considering it was 100% owned and we had all the company-operated restaurants last year, it was a few million dollars worse this year compared to last quarter but not terribly significant.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Omohundro at Wachovia.\nJeff Omohundro - Wachovia Capital Markets: Thanks. Just a question on the new Southern Style Chicken product. Just curious about the product development around that, what your testing said about price value and pricing relative to the primary competitor in that sub-segment, and whether you think you might see some skewing of results geographically with that product. Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: Sure, Jeff. We do our pricing based on what customers expect to pay in our restaurants. We do look at what other products are out there but the most valid data point is expectation at McDonald's for the specific product is what gives us the best accuracy and then how that plays with the other products on the menu that may be similar -- in this case, obviously chicken. We tested geographically dispersed on this -- we had 2,000 restaurants for this test, more than we normally have because we knew how it would perform in the south but we needed to get a better handle out west and north, and so we felt strongly enough that it\u2019s something that we believe we can do nationally, obviously with an expectation that we are going to sell more units in the south where people are familiar with it initially but that long-term, this makes sense for us across the country.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe from J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. It sounds like average ticket is up a little bit less than pricing in the United States. If I understand, I think pricing is running 3% to 3.5%. And I just wanted to understand perhaps a few implications of that. Is dollar menu up year-on-year? I think you said breakfast is doing better, so I\u2019ll take that as a yes, but do we continue to expect an increase in the average ticket less than pricing and does this influence your decision on future pricing?\nPeter J. Bensen: You are right in that the average check is up a little bit less than the average price increase and we are seeing a little more activity on the dollar menu but it still remains remarkably consistent in that 13% to 14% of sales, so when we look at our dollar menu activity, while the units may be up a little bit the percentage of total sales are in that 13% to 14%. So we are very comfortable that in this environment we are continuing to get -- keep traffic coming in the restaurants with our strategy of focusing on the value. As you know, it\u2019s much harder to get those customers to come back than it is to keep them in the restaurants, so that\u2019s an important part of it. But as we look forward, we use the pricing tool that Ralph alluded to that looks at the food away from home, it looks at the impact it would have on traffic, and so we are very cognizant of making our price changes not detrimental to our traffic or not getting away from that food away from home number. So we are pretty comfortable with the current environment that we\u2019ll continue to be able to get some price increases, maybe not 100% of our cost increases but still cover most of that margin as an investment for the future.\nRalph Alvarez: I think also a small piece in that right now is if you compared the last three or four years of what the U.S. marketing calendar has been, it\u2019s been very premium product focused and we consciously have been focused on breakfast and/or a value during these current times. And so that has a little bit of an effect also, as we kick into the Premium Chicken Sandwich, the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich now, a little bit of that will come back.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Speiser at Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser - Buckingham: Thanks. Two questions; first in Europe and in more generally outside the U.S., you did touch on breakfast and drive-thru. Can you give us a sense of what the sales mix in Europe is, all of Europe for breakfast and for drive-thru and how quickly they are growing versus the base?\nRalph Alvarez: I\u2019ll start out with breakfast, Mitch, in Europe. Again, it\u2019s a very small number, 1% to 2% except for in the U.K. where it\u2019s closer to the 10% range. Again, they are much more of a traditional English breakfast and that, when you go into the rest of Europe, it\u2019s much more of a continental breakfast focus, which is not what our core menu is, which is also why we\u2019ve gone after the McCafe strategy versus as much of our traditional menu. On a drive-thru basis, it really varies significantly throughout Europe based on the estate that we have, so it\u2019s not as much as a percentage of sales in the individual restaurant as how we develop the estate. So somewhere like the U.K., we had 400 restaurants in high streets before we ever build drive-thru number one. And in France, we have -- and Germany, a much higher drive-thru percent. So I think the number is more in the 30 -- I think overall sales is like 30% or 35% range for -- of the total sales for Europe, but it\u2019s higher in those restaurants that have drive-thru.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. The next question is from Matt Difrisco at Oppenheimer.\nMatt Difrisco - Oppenheimer: Thank you. Can you just give us a little bit of an update on -- I think you said 1,300 stores with the beverage rollout now. Is that assuming then all company-owned stores and then a couple of franchise? How does that break down and how does that hit your last stated goal, I guess, of domestically expecting by the end of \u201909 to have it completely rolled out. And then as far as a test thus far through those 1,300 stores, are you seeing that $100,000 beverage business, are you on pace for that that you thought you would be seeing in the earlier tests?\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks for the question. As we mentioned earlier, we are in 1,300 restaurants. We are on pace. We expect to do what we say. That will be implemented in 2009 in 100% of the restaurants. It\u2019s spread across the board. It\u2019s not McOpCo first and then franchise. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s more franchise than McOpCo along the way. And we\u2019ll be done when we said we would be done in \u201909. This is why I mentioned earlier that right now in \u201908, it is not a big part of our strategy in terms of growth because we are in the implementation stage and we are seeing the results, I think Ralph mentioned earlier, that we had expected from this, and we are in good shape on this strategy.\nPeter J. Bensen: And Matt, remember that $100,000 plus lift in sales is a combination of not only the specialty coffee which is the initial part of this rollout but then the broader beverage business, which includes the bottled beverages, the smoothies, the frappes, the sweet tea. So it\u2019s more holistic and so you\u2019ll see that come on in pieces.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Rachael Rothman at Merrill Lynch.\nRachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in the U.S. and the actions that you\u2019ve seen out of maybe some of the other fast food competitors? Is it similar to what you were seeing the last time we heard from you guys in January, or have you seen competitors\u2019 propensity to discount increase? Has there been any change in that? And then, could you talk a little bit about how quickly you are able to adjust either your pricing or promotions in reaction to that? Is it a six-week window or a three-month window or how you guys go about evolving your strategy in reaction to what\u2019s going on in the marketplace? Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: I\u2019ll just make a headline comment and then I\u2019ll let Ralph tell you about the details relative to the competitors, but we don\u2019t see a lot of change in the environment and most importantly when it comes to our strategies, we lead with our strategies relative to the long-term and the expectation over -- if you looked at \u201908, for example, our strategies are in the can. We don\u2019t expect if you look at everyday affordability and the value that we have on our plate today and providing our consumers and then the other initiatives around the sandwiches and the beverages, our strategy is in place. We don\u2019t expect that we are going to have to do any reacting to what the competitors are doing. But having said that, I\u2019ll let Ralph talk a little bit about what he sees in the competitive environment.\nRalph Alvarez: We saw the normal pick-up that we see every January/February when it\u2019s winter and we all [review] sales on a per day basis and people have less money in their pocket books but not anything that is significantly different than what we see every first quarter. And so -- and a reaction basis, again we don\u2019t react to them but we would react if we saw something in our business or consumer reaction that we should adjust. We stay in tune with the customer very carefully and we can do that very fast. It\u2019s not quarterly or six months. We can move on a dime in that. We have our -- 60% of our money is spent locally, which allows us to react geographically, which is very important. We are not heavily nationally buy from a media point of view, which is -- gives us that flexibility. We believe that\u2019s very important.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets: I wanted to ask that competition question from a different angle; not as it relates to discounting but as it relates to product, a lot of guys have been taking your successful snack wrap and rolling it out through their systems. Do you think that might be contributing based on your experience here to the slowdown that we are seeing in the U.S.?\nJames A. Skinner: I don\u2019t think so, Larry, and of course -- you know, what\u2019s new? This has been happening for 50 years around here but I don\u2019t really see any impact directly on these new initiatives in terms of the menu. Ralph, maybe you have seen something but I don\u2019t think so.\nRalph Alvarez: No, but you know, we look at our product mix and our product mix are strong in these different items and you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that happens when you have success. So we understand that and we\u2019ve got our next two- to three-year pipeline of different items that we\u2019ll have ready when the time is there.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Keith Siegner at Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Credit Suisse: Thanks. One more quick question on the margins; unit closures and refranchising kind of came in a little bit ahead of our expectations. Can you just outline what if any benefit these had to the company-operated margins for the quarter and if any, then how that might trend into 2Q?\nPeter J. Bensen: You know, we did see a little bit of benefit in the U.S. on our company-operated margins from some of the refranchising, but there isn\u2019t a specific target or goal that they have. So while I think probably throughout the rest of the year we\u2019ll see a slight benefit to that, it really depends on the mix of stores that they sell. They aren\u2019t specifically selling restaurants because they are poorer margin performers. They are looking more holistically at the marketplace and which doors should we operate, which ones should franchisees operate, et cetera. So while there is a slight benefit, that isn\u2019t the primary goal and something that we\u2019re necessarily focused on.\nRalph Alvarez: And on closures, we had a few in Japan as part of the plan we\u2019ve had in Japan. We also were -- we\u2019re building much more of the restaurants today with drive-thrus that we need. We had a lot of smaller inline locations and as those leases come up or we can replace, have a place for the customer base to move, we\u2019ve been doing more of that in Japan.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley at Bear Stearns.\nJoe Buckley - Bear Stearns: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question on breakfast. It has consistently been one of your stronger day parts over the last couple of years and obviously there\u2019s lots of activity in the space. What does your research show in terms of why breakfast is growing when much of the rest of the dining out market seems like it is not?\nRalph Alvarez: It\u2019s breakfast away from home that is growing. It is not breakfast in general, so if you look at coffee as a great example, coffee consumption is down overall. It\u2019s down a lot at home but it\u2019s up away from home. And so just -- you know, societal changes with less of a structured work place and people out and about. The biggest thing we see with our breakfast business, it no longer comes just at that rush we used to get. It\u2019s very steady throughout the hours we are open.\nJames A. Skinner: And Joe, if I could, breakfast has always been a great opportunity for us to deliver the best service, the best quality, and a variety of products that are very affordable. And I think we get some of our best experience delivered to our customers at breakfast and it\u2019s been that way for some time. And so we\u2019ve been in breakfast, as you know, for 30-plus years and it\u2019s a great experience for our customers at that time and it continues to get better.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Next question, David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS: Thanks. It appeared that in the first quarter in the U.S. that McDonald's same-store sales began to kind of close in with that of the industry; your share gains perhaps weren\u2019t as rapid as what they were in much of \u201906 and \u201907. And I\u2019m wondering if the lift -- do you see that the lift to your sales from breakfast and late night in particular may be diminishing and we might be in one of those time periods where those platforms may not be the lift that they were, we\u2019re waiting for this beverage initiative to get to scale, and we just may have a lower growth rate in between? Thanks.\nJames A. Skinner: David, first of all, when you look at our report this morning and when you consider the fact we are coming off of five consecutive years of growth, contributed by all day parts, including extended hours, and then the environment we are operating in here in the United States, because I\u2019m assuming your question is more about the United States as around the world, and when you look at those numbers and you look at the results, we have to be fairly pleased with where we find ourselves when you look at the backdrop of five years of success and the thresholds in terms of the law of big numbers and where we found ourselves. And so I think the answer to that question is no, other than the normal slowdown that you are seeing regarding the economy here in the United States, which I talked about in January. Ralph, I don\u2019t know if you want to say anything about those --\nRalph Alvarez: The early numbers we have, we took market share in the first quarter again and so that\u2019s -- from an absolute sales number, we were lower obviously than we\u2019ve been the last five years but we took market share and we measure that on traffic, as you know, not on sales, and our focus is on traffic because that\u2019s the critical component. You know, we get them in the restaurants, we\u2019ll figure out how to get the successful average check from them down the road.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, it looks like we are out of questions, so I\u2019ll go ahead and turn it over to Jim for a few closing comments.\nJames A. Skinner: Thanks to everybody for being on the call. In closing, I just want to reiterate that the fundamental strength of our global business continues and we\u2019ve delivered very strong first quarter results. Our Plan to Win is working in every area of the world and we\u2019ve had the right strategies in place to provide sustained, profitable growth. Our globally diversified business positions us to deliver in all types of operating environments and is an unparalleled advantage for our system and shareholders. We remain confident and optimistic that we will achiever our revenue, income, and return goals. Thank you very much.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you."}], "2010": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2009, "date": "2010-01-22 18:06:09", "content": "Executives:  Mary Kay Shaw \u2013 Vice President of Investor Relations James A.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation there will be a question and answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation.\nMary Kay Shaw: With me on the call this morning are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim I wanted to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on investor.McDonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.\nJames A. Skinner : I am pleased to report that our business growth continued in the fourth quarter contributing to another strong year for the McDonald\u2019s brand. Global comparable sales were up 2.3% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Constant currencies operating income grew 14% for the quarter and 10% for the year. 2009 marked our sixth consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our plan to win business strategy. In January, we expect to post another month of positive global comparable sales with both Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa positive and the US relatively flat. In this challenging economic environment we feel very good about our trends and we continue to grow by adapting to our customer\u2019s needs and elevating the key drivers of our plan to win those being more menu variety and choice, better restaurant operations, greater convenience and day party expansion, every day predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant investment. In all these areas we\u2019re innovating and improving and pushing ourselves to stay in step with consumers in order to give them the most outstanding dining experience in every way. This strategy and alignment helped us achieve strong results across the system in 2009. In the US comp sales increased slightly for the quarter and up 2.6 for the year contributing to an operating income growth of 5% and 6% respectively. We\u2019re proud of these results especially given the high unemployment and its impact on consumer spending. In the US last year our comp sales gap against the industry was positive every week of the year. Despite an overall decline in the informal eating out category we increased our market share and strengthened our leadership position. We drove results by delivering exceptional value, menu choice and convenience. The US maintained a strong focus on value at every level from the dollar menu to mid tier and premium offerings. This continues to make us a compelling choice for customers in this uncertain time and we continue to win through menu choice with a balance of familiar and popular core products as well as new items to keep us relevant. From our caf\u00e9 specialty coffees and our line of premium angus burgers were new offerings in 2009 and they helped us make McDonald\u2019s a more clear destination for outstanding quality at the best value. We\u2019re pushing ahead with more choices including the national launch this month of our Mac Snack Wrap and breakfast dollar menu. The Mac Snack Wrap is a snack version of our Big Mac. It is a four tier product with a good margin and it fits well in to our growing snack day part or as an add on to a meal and certainly can be eaten on the go. The breakfast dollar menu introduced in collaboration with our franchisees gives us a national voice on value at breakfast. Both of these highlight our commitment to keep modernizing our menu and provide the products that our customers are looking for. This month, we\u2019re also launching free wireless Internet access at nearly all of our US restaurants. This will make us the largest provider of free Internet in the country and make our restaurant experience even more valuable. Now, turning to Europe comparable sales were up 4.8% for the quarter and 5.2% for the year. In constant currencies operating income grew 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Europe\u2019s guiding strategies of upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency and enhancing local relevance continues to drive results. In the fourth quarter we grew our market share in the informal eating out category across Europe including the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A key to this growth was the continued focus on our three tiered menu platform everyday low price, core and premium delivering choice and value across the menu. In addition, we continued to enhance our four tier menu platform by delivering a category of smaller premium affordable products. We expanded our line of popular Petite du jour and our little taster offerings in the UK and we\u2019ve introduced fourth tier products to other markets such as Germany with the snack deluxe. All of this is building greater relevancy for our brand and stronger results for our bottom line. We also saw success from an increased emphasis on day party expansion, particularly breakfast. In Germany we expanded our breakfast line up with classic and new offerings as part of our easy morning breakfast launch and it is yielding solid results. In the UK, our number one breakfast market in Europe, strong media support helped generate some of our highest breakfast sales to date. In addition, Europe\u2019s ongoing coffee strategy including the stand alone McCafe concept is resonating with European consumers with McDonald\u2019s now being the number one seller of coffee in Germany. Many of these opportunities are enhanced by Europe\u2019s leading role in the reimaging whereby the end of 2011 85% of Europe\u2019s 6,800 restaurants will be reimaged. Let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA which delivered $1 billion in operating income in 2009. This is a long way from the $345 million they delivered in 2005. For the quarter and year comp sales were up 1.5% and 3.4% respectively. Operating income also continued to grow up 28% for the quarter and 23% for the year in constant currencies. Our growth across the region continues to come from strong execution, convenience, value, core menu and breakfast. Australia remains one of the top performing markets in our system. They\u2019ve reimaged their entire asset base, setting the stage to drive strong results with premium offerings like the popular angus line and the M Burger selections. They also launched the next version of their value picks menu as well as enhanced the drive thru experience leading to better operations and service times. Now China, although their economy is improving and we delivered an increase in comp sales and guest counts in December, we expect it will still be sometime before consumers regain confidence and are willing to spend more. In the meantime, we\u2019re making the right moves to grow our business and strengthen our connection with our Chinese consumers. We\u2019re improving operations which is differentiating our brand on service and helping build capacity during peak hours. We also launched the highly popular value lunch initiative that is helping drive guest counts and incremental sales and as we announced recently we\u2019re adding to our footprint by planning to open 150 to 175 restaurants in China in 2010. So, we remain excited about our potential growth and expansion in this region. McDonald\u2019s Japan made solid progress last year in the face of significant economic headwinds delivering positive comp sales across the majority of months. Our results were driven largely by the introduction of the Quarter Pounder, the launch of premium roast coffee and a strong focus on affordability highlighted by our popular value lunch. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we made gains through a focus on drive thru, the relaunch of McChicken and the continued success of our premium coffee products. So those are some of the recent highlights from around the world. As we turn to the year ahead I want to say a few words on our continued commitment to financial discipline and enhancing shareholder value. In 2009 we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends for a three year total of $16.6 billion in our $15 to $17 billion three year target. Going forward our philosophy regarding the use of our cash flow remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business, after that we would expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Our reinvestment strategies, our financial discipline and especially our plan to win are the mainstays of our success and the blueprint we will continue to follow to drive future growth. We\u2019re pleased with 2009\u2019s results. We remain confident in and committed to our plan to win and our customer focus strategies and as always we feel that we have the very best leadership team in place to help us achieve our goals. As you all know Don Thompson recently became our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Don has a deep knowledge of the business and has done an outstanding job leading our US business and Don will continue to drive value for the brand in his new role. At McDonald\u2019s we pride ourselves on our commitment to talent management, leadership development and always having a deep bench of strong, capable leaders. We have a great management team in place that is highly talented, well aligned and ready to deliver results. Moving forward, we\u2019re all focused on the appropriate business drivers to be more relevant to our customers every day from the best tasting food and beverage offerings to the greatest value and convenience to an unparalleled restaurant experience with our franchisees, suppliers and employees all working together I am certain we will continue to succeed on all these fronts and I am confident we will keep delivering positive results for our system and our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Pete Bensen our CFO.\nPeter J. Bensen : Every day more than 60 million customers around the world count on McDonald\u2019s for convenience, variety and value while our investors count on us to drive growth, cash flow and returns. I\u2019m proud to say that we delivered for customers and investors alike in 2009 with sales, operations, profitability and returns all improving amid a historic economic down turn. For the fourth quarter and the year we delivered double digit constant currency earnings per share growth. Even after adjusting 2008 results for the gain on sale of Pret of Manger and 2009 results for the income related to the Redbox transactions and the resolution of certain Latin America liabilities, earnings per share rose 10% in the quarter and 13% for the year in constant currencies. During the fourth quarter, primarily due to the resolution of certain Latin America retained liabilities we recorded $65 million of pre-tax income as well as a $22 million benefit in tax expense mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In total, this resulted in an $0.08 benefit to earnings per share and a 240 basis point benefit to the effective tax rate for the quarter. Combined operating margin improved significantly in 2009. At about 30% our combined operating margin is significantly higher than that of many global consumer companies. This combined operating margin performance reflects our ability to drive strong franchise and company operated margins while controlling G&A spending. Total margin dollars for McDonald\u2019s restaurants reached a record $8.8 billion in 2009, up about 6% in constant currencies. Franchise margin dollars which represents nearly $6 billion of the total grew at a faster pace as we continued to execute our refranchising strategy. As a percent of revenues, franchise margins were strong at 82.1% for both the quarter and the year. Over the last two years we\u2019ve refranchised more than 1,100 restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy and today more than 80% of McDonald\u2019s restaurants worldwide are franchised. We expect to refranchise a couple of hundred more restaurants in 2010. Company operated margins were up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.8% driven by positive comparable sales, lower commodity costs and refranchising. For the year, company operated margins increased 60 basis points to 18.2%, the highest level in a decade. Throughout 2009 our US business outperformed the overall informal eating out industry and the fourth quarter was no exception. Easing commodity costs benefitted margins in the fourth quarter as our grocery bill declined about 4%. Refranchising also enhanced the margin increase. As a result, our US business delivered outstanding company operated margins of 20.3% for the quarter and 19.4% for the year. Strong company operating margins are a key indicator of our business health and restaurant level cash flow. In 2009 average restaurant cash flow growth for our owner operators was the strongest in 15 years. We closed the year with average annual pre-debt cash flow approaching $320,000 per restaurant. This stronger owner operator cash flow helps enable future reinvestments in the business like support for breakfast dollar menu or reimaging. In Europe, company operated margins increased 130 basis points in the fourth quarter driven by strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and utility costs. The UK, France and many other countries drove this improvement as our menu, variety and value continued to appeal to customers. While Europe\u2019s local currency grocery bill declined 3% in the quarter, currency rates continued to pressure commodity costs in Russia and other eastern European countries making the net impact of food and paper costs slightly negative. For the year, company operated margins rose 40 basis points in Europe, reaching a 10 year high of 18.4%. In Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, company operated margins increased 260 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year company operated margins rose 90 basis points to a very healthy 16.8%. Our sustained strong performance in Australia and operating efficiencies and lower commodity costs throughout the segment drove the improvement for both periods. We are confident we can deliver strong company operated margins going forward as we continue to execute our strategies related to price, product mix and promotion while driving efficiencies and managing costs. As it relates to food and paper costs, our initial outlook for 2010 is four our basket of goods to be relatively flat in the US and Europe with easier comparisons in the first half of the year. Turning to G&A, in constant currencies G&A was up slightly for the quarter and down for the year. 2009 marks the fifth consecutive year that G&A declined as a percent of both sales and revenues and we expect G&A as a percent of sales and revenues will continue to decline in 2010. While total G&A dollars will be up slightly on a reported basis at today\u2019s exchange rates, G&A should be relatively flat in constant currency. The timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our Bi-Annual Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention will impact the quarterly comparisons. Our proven ability to drive sales, deliver strong margins and control spending along with our franchise business model all have positive implications for our cash flow. As we continue to be disciplined in how we use this cash, our philosophy has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business as Jim said. We have the financial capacity and the local talent to invest capital back in to our business when many others cannot. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to leverage to further differentiate the McDonald\u2019s experience. In 2010 we will invest about $2.4 billion in capital expenditures. Our goal is to elevate our brand to drive sustainable growth while continuing to earn strong returns. Approximately half of our capital expenditures will be used to open about 1,000 new restaurants around the world including roughly 500 in Asia Pacific, 250 in Europe and 150 in the US. The other half of our capital expenditures will be allocated towards reimaging over 2,000 existing locations. Nearly half of these remodels will be in Europe, 600 in Asia Pacific and 500 in the US. Reimaging has a direct positive impact on sales and market share as our experience in the US, France and Australia demonstrates. In 2010 our reimaging efforts will be focused on both the interior and exterior of our restaurants. As we\u2019ve done in the past we will co-invest with our owner/operators in these high impact reimaging efforts. It\u2019s important to remember that as we make these investments we are also upgrading our asset base. This is because we own the land and buildings or hold long term leases on the property underlying our restaurants. In addition, by sharing in the investment we can accelerate initiatives, reach scale faster and positively impact our business sooner. On a final note, as you know for most of 2009 currency translation was a significant headwind negatively impacting full year earnings per share by $0.15. However, this headwind became a tailwind in the fourth quarter, a benefit we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters. Based on current rates, we estimate that currency translation will positively impact first quarter earnings by about $0.05 or $0.06 per share and the full year benefit is estimated to be approximately $0.06 to $0.08 per share. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a strong balance sheet and cash flow and owner/operators and suppliers who are aligned and focused. As we move forward in 2010 we will continue to leverage our competitive strengths to extend our lead in the marketplace and drive value for our shareholders and global system. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw : I\u2019ll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll come back to you for follow up questions as time allows. Your first question comes from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS: I guess this is a simple question but could you comment on your traffic trends per restaurant and how your same store sales trends have trended versus the industry? I remember during your analyst day you showed a wider gap at the end of the year versus the competition and that\u2019s obviously US specific but perhaps you can comment as whether that gap as remained as wide recently?\nJames A. Skinner : Our trends have remained the same and fortunately we had traffic growth or guest count growth in every segment of the business last year and much of that was because we were capable of sort of keeping the average check in place. We didn\u2019t take as many price increases, we don\u2019t have the pricing elasticity and of course, our consumers today around the world deserve a break if you will relative to pricing around food away from home and we\u2019ve kept the line on that very well and we have therefore been the recipients of this guest count growth if you will.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.\nMatthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Can you just tell us where in the 2010 plans do you expect to do the refranchising? Then also can you just give us some commentary or greater detail as far as looking at the contraction on the franchise margin, especially in the US, what is behind that just so we can have better modeling purposes?\nJames A. Skinner : I\u2019ll let Pete talk about the franchise numbers relative to the financials but you\u2019re not going to see the same kind of wholesale activity that we\u2019ve had in the past relative to refranchising. We\u2019ve done the bulk of it already but it will continue to be done in the same markets that we\u2019ve done it in over the past. As stated, we are going to refranchise about 1,500, we\u2019re well past the 1,100 almost 1,200 mark now and so it is across the markets and it is not significant really in the scheme of things so the relationship is going to remain about the same.\nPeter J. Bensen : Matt, regarding the franchise margins in the US, the comp was a little bit lower in the quarter and there is a lot of fixed costs in that margin so we had a little less leverage on that. But also with the investments in the beverage initiative we\u2019ve had a little higher depreciation and amortization but we also saw a little bit less impact from owner/operator incentives. Hopefully that helps.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from [Sara Cenatour] \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.\n[Sara Cenatour] \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Just a question about comps because you gave us an update in January, first just generally speaking in the US it got a little better in December and then it looks like you were saying sort of flattish in January. Is that just calendar shift and overall trends have been pretty stable or are we seeing something different December to January because I know it is sort of a choppy environment out there. Then jumping over to the other side of the world to China you said traffic was up and it looks to me like deflation is trending down so should we expect to see pricing get a little better there too?\nJames A. Skinner : First on the United States and then I\u2019ll let Pete talk a little bit about the pricing and the relationship in China. But, I think in the US the trends are actually better in January when you factor out weather. Weather has had a tremendous impact on our trends here in January. We don\u2019t normally like to talk about weather but we can\u2019t avoid it when you look at the first 14 or 15 days of the month and the severity of the weather, I think it was impacting us probably around 3% a day in the sales because whenever we had the weather that was normalized we saw much better results. So if anything I would say the trends are a little bit better than they were in December.\nPeter J. Bensen : Sara as far as China a couple of things, yes we did report positive sales and guest count movement in December. You won\u2019t see that in January though because we have the shift of the Chinese New Year so last year that was in January and this year it will be in February so by comparison that will be a little bit choppy. But, we\u2019re optimistic in what we\u2019re seeing with the trends. We\u2019ve talked about China in the south, and the central and the north so we saw all three of those areas improving in December and are kind of cautiously optimistic as the consumer starts to spend a little bit of money there that we will then be able to get a little bit more out of price and get a little more traffic moving there so that\u2019s a perspective for you.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.\nDavid Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Another follow up question on the US comp trend, it looks like traffic might have picked up fairly considerably when you adjust for pricing rolling off in December and the weather comment you just made. What do you think is driving that trend? Is it the industry trends are getting better or do you think that it is some of your initiatives such as maybe more marketing allocation towards the dollar menu?\nJames A. Skinner : I think as you know we launched the dollar menu at breakfast nationally. We have a very strong national voice against breakfast right now. All of our franchisees are on board and we have a lot of messaging out there about the dollar menu not only all day but now at breakfast. Then, the Mac Snack Wrap that we talked about. So I think it is more about our initiatives and the communication around the menu because really when you look at trends in the industry and you look at the spending of our consumers and the consumer confidence even though it has edged up the last couple of months, with the unemployment where it is until we start to see job creation and we start to see people get comfortable with the fact that they have a place to go to work and have a steady income we\u2019re not going to see in my opinion enormous pickups or big change relative to the trends and the consumer spending.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Steve West \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nSteve West \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Real quick, can you give a little bit of color on the McCafe, the phase two that you guys have been rolling out? How many stores do you have that in now and when can we start expecting to see the TV advertising campaign pickup for that phase two?\nJames A. Skinner : Well our McCafe project has gone very, very well for us certainly on the coffee side. We\u2019re now in to smoothies and frappes introducing those in to the restaurants and we\u2019re well on our way with the frappes, the smoothies are a little bit behind that but we expect to be ready to go in the summer time. I can\u2019t tell you exactly when they\u2019ll be messaging around it but we\u2019re going to be pretty much ready to go in the summer.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Just one quick follow up on the breakfast menu, the value menu, can you tell us what you expect that that will mix as far as contribution to revenues and what the economics of that product are? Then, on the US margin side for the quarter 20.3% company operated margin, I think that is the best quarterly margin you\u2019ve put up, at least as far back as my model goes. I recognize commodity costs are a big driver of that but in anticipation of maybe the environment getting worse did you guys get more aggressive and pull other levers to control the margin side of things?\nJames A. Skinner : I\u2019ll let Pete talk about the margin in a minute but the mix on the dollar menu and the contribution of that and the Mac Snack Wrap for example now is too soon to tell. We just started it, we really don\u2019t have a good feel for how it\u2019s going to shake out over time but we are very pleased with the economics around it otherwise we probably wouldn\u2019t have done it, one. Number two, with the support of our franchisees and everybody being all the way in on this we think it gives us the opportunity to deliver fairly well around that dollar menu but it is too early to really tell you exactly what the details of that are because we don\u2019t have the data.\nPeter J. Bensen : Steven on that before I get in to the total margin question, it was a relatively low increase we need in transactions in the US from the dollar menu breakfast to be margin dollar neutral and so we feel pretty confident we\u2019ll be able to hit that. But in terms of the total margin in the US for the fourth quarter, the 20.3% it was 75% of that was driven by the commodities and then the rest basically the refranchising. You saw comps were relatively flat so we really didn\u2019t get anything out of the sales line so it was really the costs and the refranchising benefit. There were no other special levers or anything like that which gives us confidence in the environment moving forward with the commodity costs remaining benign. As we can move that top line a little bit more we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: [Inaudible] about growing share in a declining market in the US but your systems sales grew 3% so you clearly actually were more than sort of neutral there. So can you talk about how much share you think you took in 2009 and how much you think the informal eating market contracted this past year?\nJames A. Skinner : Well, it varies by market but we grew our informal eating out market share really in every segment of the world. If you look at the US for example we were up about 2/10ths or 3/10ths of 1% to about 11.3%. When you really look, that\u2019s a pretty big number when you really think about the size of the informal eating out market. It varies around the world but we had increases in every market. I can\u2019t tell you how much informal eating out declined in every market around the world because it certainly varies but it has either been stagnant or shrinking in most markets. Most of our growth in 2009 came from share growth around the world.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Mark Kalinowski \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC.\nMark Kalinowski \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC: [Inaudible] further in to sales trends dynamics in China. The sense I\u2019m getting is that lower priced chains like McDonald\u2019s, KFC are generally struggling but higher priced chains might be struggling even worse. There\u2019s a fair amount of discounting going on in the quick service environment, if you could talk about some of those details that would be great.\nJames A. Skinner : I think on an overall basis the pricing relationships in China in the quick service restaurant industry are in an interesting dilemma because of who you are competing against which is a very low price menu on the street from the non sort of chain restaurants and food available. We are not necessarily discounting but what we are doing is getting our price right in relationship to the economic time that we find ourselves in which is an ongoing pricing relationship as compared to a discounting of our food. It moves up and down the scale depending on where we find ourselves in the consumer spending. As we\u2019ve said, I think the environment of China which basically fell off a cliff after the 2008 Beijing Olympics. We\u2019ve adjusted accordingly along the way to be relevant with our consumers and its worked well for us.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Jeffrey Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.\nJeffrey Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I was just wondering if you could talk to the strategies that you were pursuing to support check just given the step up both in the breadth of value offerings and as well your marketing support of those efforts?\nPeter J. Bensen : Specifically I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the US but these kind of comments apply around the world. As you know, it\u2019s a market share battle out there so focusing on driving customer counts is important but we need some other elements to help keep the average check from falling off a cliff so things like in the US the Mac Snack Wrap which is both a transaction driver and also something that can either trade people up from the dollar menu or add on to an extra value meal is a margin enhancer. You think about the next phase of the beverages rolling out in the US, the frappes and the smoothies, those are very nice margin and average check enhancers if you will. It\u2019s early in these tests but we\u2019re seeing a nice trade between the espresso based coffees which are over 50% in the morning and these smoothies and frappes are a much smaller percentage in the morning and a much greater percent in that kind of snack day part which should help fill in there. In the US also you think about the angus burger, that wasn\u2019t necessarily a traffic driver but it was a trade up mechanism that delivered more in the margins. So taking that and summarizing for the rest of the world kind of that focus on some premium products, the focus on beverages, the focus on fourth tier menus are some of the things that we\u2019re doing that are helping balance that check and traffic part of the equation.\nJames A. Skinner : If I could, I think a number of these frappes, smoothies and even in McCafe have generated some new visits and those new visits have also generated food sales and so that\u2019s been helpful. But, at the same time the dollar menu experience and the trading against that has remained about the same so all of these other items that are on the menu have picked up our opportunity relative to average check.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Jeffery Farmer \u2013 Jefferies & Co.\nJeffery Farmer \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Just a follow up on some of the commodity questions, it looks like your consolidated food and paper cost fell by about 180 bips in the fourth quarter so how should we think about that number in 2010 given the outlook for relatively flat commodity costs this year?\nJames A. Skinner : Jeff, we don\u2019t provide that kind of forward-looking guidance. There are so many moving parts, how much are prices going to increase, they\u2019re going to impact the base that we are measuring that food and paper change off of and product mix also impacts that so we\u2019re not really forecasting that. But, we are optimistic obviously with the commodity costs at the levels that we\u2019re seeing them.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I have a question on the European company margins, Pete you shared with us that because of the importing of food in to Russia and some of the eastern European markets that the food costs were slightly negative, you mentioned labor and utilities being negative, you got a big positive bump in the company margin, I\u2019m wondering what else is left there that you leveraged?\nPeter J. Bensen : While the food and paper cost had a slight negative impact for the quarter, compared to the previous quarter if you\u2019re looking sequentially they were over 100 basis points better, the food and paper impact so a lot of the impact is coming from more benign food and paper costs and thee strong comp we had there in the quarter and refranchising so that\u2019s really the items.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.\nJason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Just a little more color on the outlook for food costs and pricing, we\u2019ve seen some of the commodities starting to lap the more favorable trends from 2009, particularly cheese and ground beef. I\u2019m just wondering how high your confidence level is in that flat number? I mean you guys have some of the big items pretty much locked in for the year? And, just your thoughts on pricing if you were to see some movement in some of these items against you do you feel like you could take some price at this point?\nPeter J. Bensen : As we look at how we finished 2009 I would say generally around the world we probably had about a percent left in price on average between the US and all the major markets and as we head in to 2010 it is probably going to be a little less compared to 2009, probably where we are or down a little bit. You appropriately point out that we look for opportunities to lock in our costs when we can. We\u2019re able to do a little more of that in the US versus Europe and APMEA but we\u2019re becoming more active in those markets as well. We\u2019re constantly looking at the marketplace to see do we have opportunities to raise price without negatively impacting the traffic. It\u2019s quite interesting when you look at the difference a year makes, a year ago we had all our teams around the world doing scenario planning for what\u2019s going to happen if the environment gets a lot worse. Today, those scenario planning discussions are around being able to make sure we can catch the upswing when it comes and how are we going to be able to take advantage of that. We are really focused on being able to maximize that top line when we do see the rebound.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Mitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research.\nMitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research: A couple of questions on beverages, Pete I believe in the third quarter in the US company margins were up about 110 bips and then up 150 bips in the fourth quarter. Is there any way to pull out what the increasing beverage mix contributed to that margin expansion? And, with the smoothies and frappes coming out is that in fact a margin enhancer, a percent margin enhancer as well?\nPeter J. Bensen : Mitch, no is the short answer to the first part but that sequential change it was definitely an improvement in all commodity costs that helped the margin in the fourth quarter offset by less sales in the fourth quarter. As we look at the impact of the frappes and smoothies going forward we are optimistic on a per unit basis that it is accretive to margins on a percentage basis and in tests, while it is early, we aren\u2019t going to give movement units but if you think about those two products they are a lot closer in to the core McDonalds customer and the core McDonalds menu compared to the espresso based coffee so we are starting to see some pretty nice movement in the test markets so we\u2019re optimistic on the impact it can have later on in the year.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Obviously remodels are increasing in importance in fiscal \u201910 and that will be a multiyear process for you. As you begin to finish Europe I presume that the US will receive more of the attention longer term. Is it possible for you to talk about what your remodel cash contribution is in the US with the franchises are what kind of sales lift that you\u2019re seeing from that expense?\nJames A. Skinner : Let me just start and then I\u2019ll let Pete talk about the contribution mechanism that we\u2019ve used over the years, it varies by market of course, we\u2019re still wrestling with it here in the US but he might be able to add some more texture to that. We\u2019re reinvesting more in reimaging and remodeling across the board. We don\u2019t wait for Europe to be finished and then give more allocation to the United States, everybody has their own plan. We\u2019ve accelerated the plan across the board and so it is not about waiting for one segment to get done so we can start so we can start the other. We have plenty of wherewithal to do it on a consistent basis in every segment. Pete, do you want to talk about the contribution?\nPeter J. Bensen : We know John that reinvesting with our operators is the right thing to do to help accelerate these initiatives and give them the scale more quickly and we know from our test markets that there\u2019s plenty of cash flow and return for both us and the owner/operators. On the specific US imitative that is going to move forward, we do not have a final decision on what that contribution is going to be. Once we get that figured out we will be able to communicate that but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be dramatically different from what we\u2019ve done in the past or dramatically different from what we\u2019ve done with something like the beverage initiative. But until we get that worked out and finalized we don\u2019t want to share that but definitely it is focused on allocating returns at appropriate level for us and the owner/operators. When we do the full reimage we don\u2019t have a whole lot of them done in the US but we do know from other markets generally we see a 6% to 7% sales lift relative to the rest of the marketplace. When we do the holistic reimage meaning a really nice blow out job on the dining room and the inside along with the exterior of the building and the landscaping and everything.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Gregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citi.\nGregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citi: Just assuming no real change in the macro in terms of unemployment, how do you see your kind of message going forward over the next quarter or two in terms of really focusing it on value? Do you see that increasing or about the same?\nJames A. Skinner : We expect to keep the peddle to the metal if you will relative to value everywhere in the world because I don\u2019t see much changing. More importantly, we\u2019ve had a fairly steady contribution relative to value messaging over the past few years in recessionary and non-recessionary times because it is extraordinarily important for our customers to understand everyday affordability at McDonald\u2019s exists in the good times and the bad times which is why it was fairly easy for us to continue to support the dollar menu across the United States and then across our every day affordability in other segments of the business because that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve structured our menu and the understanding of the consumer expectation.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse: Just one follow up question on kind of the approach to promotional activity and pricing, we\u2019ve talked about unemployment, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about commodities, when you think out what the determining factors will be that are going to influence your approach are those the primary things? Is a return to inflation at the at home food markets, does that help? How do you rank the determining factors that influence your approach to pricing and promotional activities?\nJames A. Skinner : Let me just say in some cases we would like to say it\u2019s that scientific. It really is as much an art as it is a science because we do take all of those things in to consideration and factor but on a wholesale basis it\u2019s intuitive to understand our pricing relative to the consumer so when we talk about not having as much pricing elasticity that Pete had talked about earlier because of commodities and other kinds of things in the past or certainly the inflationary environment and more importantly the consumer confidence and the unemployment, we don\u2019t have as much pricing power as we might have had. So we really don\u2019t even talk about how we\u2019re able to pass on any costs that we might have to absorb when we do our pricing models and how we communicate with our consumers around value. We decide that it is important for us to continue to have everyday affordability, present to our consumers a value proposition that makes us a compelling choice relative to eating out when they choose to eat out and all those factors are considered. But, we do that on a regular basis, not just during recessionary times and of course since we\u2019ve been in this situation now some would argue for more than two years it continues to be the consumer insight that we use and make our decisions around and it doesn\u2019t necessarily leverage any movement back and forth determining the strength around our messaging except to say that it\u2019s been fairly consistent.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Tom Forte \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group.\nTom Forte \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group: On breakfast can you give us a sense as where it stands today as far as mix of sales in the US if it is still at 25%? Then you talked about January you are going to roll out the dollar menu system wide across the US, can you give us a sense at the start of the fourth quarter and end of the fourth quarter what percent of your system already had the dollar menu in place at breakfast?\nJames A. Skinner : It is small percentage at the beginning of the end of the fourth quarter on the dollar menu at breakfast. The breakfast percentage does remain the same as a big piece of our business if you look at it that way. The dollar menu and the voice around dollar menu will certainly help our growth and by the way we grew breakfast in \u201909 not only in the fourth quarter but year-to-date December which was not an easy feat considering the fact that we were faced with the unemployment that we were and second of all we had a very strong \u201909 with the McSkillet and the Chicken Biscuit introduction so we had some numbers to overcome there and we are very proud of our results and our consumers have rewarded us because they know the great value there is for breakfast in our restaurants.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Paul Westra \u2013 Cowen & Company.\nPaul Westra \u2013 Cowen & Company: I guess my question specifically is if you can give us some more color on the return on capital trends you\u2019re seeing in eastern Europe and Russia in particular and what other kind of real world impacts I guess you\u2019re seeing on those returns in the cross border transaction issues? And perhaps, you might give us some updates on the supply chain efforts you are doing to help mitigate these impacts?\nPeter J. Bensen : Listen, obviously what you\u2019re seeing on the impact on commodities on our eastern and central European markets is having a little bit of a hit to the profitability there so just by doing the math our returns are down a little bit but the reality is we\u2019re still getting good returns in those parts of the world and there is still great opportunity to grow there and so we\u2019re going to continue to invest capital there. When we look at opportunities to mitigate the impact we do have to make some of these cost benefit type trade off decisions around can we hedge at an effective cost or are we comfortable just kind of letting it ride? We were a little surprised to see the Ruble still down against the dollar in the fourth quarter, we thought it might snap a little bit by then. Russia in December was strong, we saw good sales for the year in Russia and it continues to be a highly profitable and great long term market for us. So there\u2019s really no concerns in the returns perspective there and we\u2019re going to continue to do our best to mitigate the impact of the currencies but not over pay for any protection.\nMary Kay Shaw : Your next question comes from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS: Back just this last year going in to the summer it felt like the consumer environment was getting tougher. In retrospect did you reallocate marketing dollars and attention a little bit away from some of the things that might have been more incremental, the premium stuff the beverages, and towards value in a very meaningful way in terms of dollars? And conversely, when things change and if indeed the consumer comes back and things become a little more receptive to those incremental sales, will that get a disproportionate amount of dollars in the future?\nJames A. Skinner : We\u2019ll make that call when the time comes. I\u2019ll be anxious to make that decision. I think the interesting thing to point out around media is that we\u2019re a 52 week communicator in media in every segment of the business. We did not pull back on communication with our consumers and the media spend in any respect, if anything we got more efficiencies during this down turn because of our buys. The answer is yes, we did put a little more effort against breakfast and value in the US in terms of dollars spent against media.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from [Howard Penny \u2013 Hedge I Management].\n[Howard Penny \u2013 Hedge I Management]: Do you think the shift in the dollar menu at breakfast is permanent meaning is this something that will help you get through 2010 and if the economy gets better you\u2019ll remove it?\nJames A. Skinner : The answer to that right now is yes.\nPeter J. Bensen : Yes, it\u2019s permanent and we have no plans to remove it.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I wanted to follow up my first question because either you didn\u2019t understand the question or I didn\u2019t understand the answer and then I had another question. The second question is does the McCafe sales mix build as the cold weather took place? Is the product a little bit more seasonal than perhaps you expected? Discuss the seasonality of that product. Then Pete, back to Europe for a moment, the European company margin was up 130 basis points and if I understood your answer or some of you comments in the call, food costs sounded like they were up, labor costs were up and utilities up as a percent of sales and I am just not understanding how you get 130 basis points of improvement if you\u2019ve got the major cost items like that all negative?\nPeter J. Bensen : I\u2019ll get in to that in a little more detail.\nJames A. Skinner : The coffee did spike up some, the McCafe product spiked up some during the colder weather and some of that was a shift away from the ice tea and some of the other beverage initiatives as the weather cooled off if you will.\nPeter J. Bensen : Regarding the margin in Europe, if I look at the progression, the 130 basis point improvement for the quarter, we got pricing and traffic gave us a lot of growth there and relatively flat food and paper so slightly negative, 30 basis points and a similar benefit from refranchising as we had going forward. So nothing else really unusual it was really top line driven with modest cost increases and the benefit from refranchising.\nMary Kay Shaw : The next question comes from Mitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research.\nMitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research: In the US more of a bigger picture question, labor has been somewhat of an ongoing pressure, I don\u2019t know if you mentioned it in the fourth quarter, there is no minimum wage increase, obviously the unemployment rate is up. Do you think relative labor expense could work in your favor in 2010?\nPeter J. Bensen : Mitch, in terms of labor rates I think maybe we saw about a 3% increase in the average wage throughout the year, probably something very similar to that going forward, maybe a little bit less. But really on the labor side, we\u2019re focused more on driving more productivity so more transactions per crew hour and that\u2019s where we\u2019re able to mitigate and have some benefits actually on the labor line as we focus on those efficiencies.\nMary Kay Shaw : The final question comes from [Bob Coleman].\n[Bob Coleman]: In regards to your future cap ex of $2.2 billion, should we expect that investment to generate a higher return on existing equity or could it be capping out at these levels?\nPeter J. Bensen : Bob, we continue to operate under our targets of getting returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens so our expectations on these increases are that we will continue to see returns at that level or better as we move forward. So, we\u2019re not lowering our standard in an effort to increase the cap ex.\nMary Kay Shaw : Thank you. That\u2019s the end of our questions. I\u2019ll go ahead and turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.\nJames A. Skinner : Thanks everybody for joining us today. In closing I want to reiterate that the McDonald\u2019s global business continues to be strong. Our globally diversified business positions us to deliver in all types of operating environments and is an unparalleled advantage for our system and shareholders. We have the right plans in place to grow our business for toady and over the long term. We will continue to follow our plan to win and execute our strategies on an even higher level to remain modern, relevant and in step with our customers. With our entire system aligned and focused I am confident that we will continue to deliver through our 60 million customers every day.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator instructions). I'd now like to turn the call over to Miss Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Miss Shaw, you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Jim Skinner is travelling today and will not be joining us on the call. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Ralph, I want to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Those documents are available on investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with our corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Ralph.\nRalph Alvarez: Thank you, Mary Kay and good morning, everyone. Our solid business performance continued in the second quarter. Global comparable sales increased 4.8%, consolidated operating income increased 11% in constant currencies, every area of the world contributed to our growth and EPS reached $0.98, a 3% increase in constant currencies. Excluding last year's $0.10 benefit from the sale of Pret A Manger and this year's $0.01 benefit from both the Redbox and Indonesia transactions, EPS increased 13% in constant currencies. Today, I'll talk about the strategies driving our momentum. I'll also share a few highlights from each of our geographies, the U.S., Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA as we call it, and then B, we'll go through the numbers in greater detail before we open it up for Q&A. The \"Plan to Win\" continues to serve as our foundation as we remain focused on our strategy of getting better, not just bigger. Our strength continues to be driven by everyday predictable low prices, menu choice, better restaurant operations, convenience, and our ongoing restaurant reinvestment programs. Now, turning to the U.S., comparable sales for the second quarter were up 3.5% and operating income grew 5% to $835 million. Our share of the U.S. informal eating-out or IEO category is up about 50 basis points year-to-date. That's the strongest IEO share growth the U.S. has experienced in more than six years. A balanced marketing calendar is contributing to these increases. In the second quarter, we advertised Big Mac, Dollar Menu, the McCafe launch, and Breakfast. And now, for an update on McCafe. We\u2019ve grown our coffee business from 2% to 5% of sales over the last few years. And this has largely been driven by McCafe. The national advertising launch in May created excellent awareness and drove significant incremental unit movement. Results are at or exceeding our expectations and are also accretive to our restaurant margins. As a result of our balanced approach, sales remain positive across all our day parts. While comps did slow in June, we were positive. While the IEO category, however, was negative and thus we continued to grow share. Our U.S. July comp sales are trending similar to or better than they did in June. We have now started the rollout of the Angus burger during the month of July, but won't advertise it nationally yet. Early results are strong and customers are telling us they love the products. The Angus burger line will also be accretive to our margins. Now, let's turn to Europe where our momentum continues. Sales and guest count increases were strong with comp sales up 6.9%, resulting in an operating income increase of 10% in constant currencies. Europe strategies to upgrade the customer and employee experience, build brand transparency, and enhance local relevance continue to deliver results. Our share of IEO business continues to grow in Europe also. In fact, we experienced 6% to 8% greater momentum in customer visits than the branded competitive set in Europe's top five countries. The U.K. maybe the best example of our brand continuing to get stronger. The combination of balanced marketing efforts, beautifully reimaged restaurants, a focus on operations excellence and the introduction of great new products that are affordable continues to produce outstanding results. For the second quarter, the U.K. delivered an impressive 13% comp sales increase, resulting in double-digit operating income growth. Our French business also remained strong. Families are choosing to visit McDonald's for an experience that offers quality food at an affordable price in great surroundings. Starting in July, the French government has reduced the VAT for all in-restaurant meals, which will effectively increase our sales going forward. The VAT reduction also enables us to reduce the price of some of our menu items and accelerate the interior \u2013 the exterior reimaging of our restaurants over the next couple of years. It will also translate into more benefits for our crew. Now, let's talk about Germany, Europe's most price sensitive market. It also delivered positive comparable sales and guess counts for the quarter in addition to significant share growth. But business in Germany does continue to fluctuate. We are seeing a shift in our product mix to more core menu items and entry-level products, which is impacting our average check. While our margins are up, we must continue to grow traffic to produce results in this economy. It is a market share battle at McDonald's' way. Consolidated Europe's July comp sales are currently trending stronger than they were in June and we are confident our emphasis on convenience, menu choice combined with value will continue to produce excellent results. Now, let's turn to APMEA where comparable sales increased 4.4% and operating income grew 34% in constant currencies. Our markets are aggressively working to ensure value initiatives are strategic, branded, and support baseline growth. I'm going to start out with Australia, which continues to deliver double-digit sales counts. We have reimaged nearly all of our restaurants including the addition of McCafes to freestanding locations. We continue to offer everyday value while introducing relevant new products and improving our operations. Our ability to collectively execute on these aspects is what's driving our business in this important market. In fact, over the last five years, Australia has grown the average guest count per restaurant by 105,000 and now exceeds 500,000 per store. Now, let's talk about China where comparable sales have been negative. We have been most impacted in the South where 40% of our restaurants are located. Significant factory closings and a hurting economy are causing millions of people to relocate back to their home provinces. We continue to have confidence in China though and believe this situation is a temporary one. We have strong in-restaurant control and lower commodity costs, which are both helping us to continue to grow margins. Our business remains solidly profitable with excellent returns and we remain on plan to open 140 new restaurants in 2009. Overall, APMEA delivered a solid quarter with great growth in operating income. Looking ahead, July sales also continue to trend positive. Australia continues to remain strong, China is soft, and Japan has been slower. In closing, McDonald's continues to win. In an economic environment where GDP is declining and unemployment is increasing, we are growing share. In fact, comp sales, guest counts, and operating income all were stronger in quarter two than they were in quarter one. Our brand is getting stronger and we continue to deliver. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Pete.\nPete Bensen: Thanks, Ralph and good morning, everyone. It's clear to us that consumers today are much more discerning about their money and time. They count on McDonald's for friendly convenient service, variety and value across all tiers of our menu. We are meeting their needs and in turn, building sales, guest counts, and market share around the world despite the current economic environment. As a result, second quarter revenues, operating income, and earnings per share all increased in constant currencies. And we strengthened our operating profitability with year-to-date combined operating margin up 200 basis points to 28.7%. This performance demonstrates our success at driving restaurant margin dollar growth, as well as our ongoing control of G&A spending, which declined in constant currencies. As a percent of sales, consolidated company-operated margins increased 20 basis points in the second quarter due to solid comparable sales and refranchising, partly offset by higher commodity costs. This performance demonstrates our success balancing price increases, product promotions, and cost to manage restaurant profitability. For example, in the U.S., our refranchising efforts along with the launch of our McCafe specialty coffees and a focus on the Big Mac at full price, contributed to second quarter company-operated margins increasing 50 basis points to 19.6%. This improvement came even as we took only nominal menu price increases during the quarter. U.S. company-operated margins also reflect moderating commodity cost pressures. In the second quarter, our basket of goods increased 4.4% versus 2008. This is down sequentially from the 6.7% increase experienced in the first quarter. We continue to leverage our collaborative supplier relationships, scale and risk management practices to take strategic advantage of opportunities to effectively manage the impact of fluctuating commodity costs. As a result, we are adjusting our outlook for the U.S. food and paper costs. We now expect a 3% to 3.5% increase in our basket of goods for the full year, which implies an increase of about 1% for the second half of the year. In Europe, company operated margins rose 10 basis points, thanks primarily to strong sales in the U.K. and refranchising in both the U.K. and Germany. This was partly offset by margin declines in some Eastern European countries, which continued to feel the effect of weak local currency on commodity imports. Due to the local supply chain infrastructure, many of our Eastern European markets import 30% to 50% of their products. These purchases, mainly beef and chicken, are primarily denominated in either euro or U.S. dollars. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity in these markets as we navigate these short-term challenges. For Europe overall, we are also seeing an easing up commodity cost pressures. In the second quarter, our basket of goods rose 6% versus last year, down sequentially from the 9% first quarter increase. For the full year, our revised outlook is for Europe's basket of goods to also increase 3% to 3.5%, resulting in relatively flat costs in the second half of the year. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins increased 60 basis points, driven by positive comparable sales in many markets. Australia continues to benefit from our premium menu offerings and convenience initiatives including 24-hour operations and drive through. In China, while sales continue to be negatively impacted by economic weakness, our margins are solid and were up in the quarter, primarily due to lower commodity costs and improved operating efficiencies. Turning to franchise margins, consolidated franchise margins as a percent of revenues were strong at 82.3% due to positive global comparable sales, offset by the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs. We have evolved to a more heavily franchised structure, now 80% franchised worldwide. In the second quarter, about 200 restaurants were either refranchised or transitioned to the developmental license structure. This has direct positive implications for the stability of our very substantial and growing cash flow. Our first priority for this cash continues to be reinvesting in our business to build returns and enhance shareholder value. After capital expenditures, our next use of free cash flow is to fund dividends and then finally, to repurchase shares. Through June, we\u2019ve returned more than $14 billion to shareholders under our three-year $15 billion to $17 billion cash return target. We will likely end the year in the upper half of this range. A key focus of our capital expenditures has been to elevate our brand in the mind of our customers to drive growth in sales and market share. This can take many forms from building one of our new modern design restaurants to reimaging existing locations to make them more comfortable and contemporary or to enhance efficiency to take advantage of new business opportunities. Today, more than a third of our restaurants worldwide reflect a more contemporary design. Our business will continue to benefit from these efforts in the years ahead. It's important to realize that as we make these investments in our business, we are also upgrading our asset base. We currently own the land for about 45% of our sites in our wholly owned markets, which is on our book to historical costs and we lease the rest. Our preference is to own our sites where possible. The fact that we own or control the leases for our sites is an important distinction that sets McDonald's apart. It fosters a greater alignment with our owner/operators, not only because we have a mutual best interest in optimizing sales performance, but also because our owner/operators have a financially strong partner who shares in the cost of going into business with them. As a result, our owner/operators require less debt, have stronger balance sheets and given our ongoing momentum, their cash flow is strong and growing, better enabling them to reinvest for the long term. A financially strong franchisee base is reflective of McDonald's' strong financial foundation. With our healthy balance sheet, strong credit rating, and significant cash balance, we can be opportunistic in the current environment. For example, as one of the few retailers adding new units, we are being even more selective to secure better sites that will deliver better returns in the long run. Our strength also gives us an advantage as we negotiate leases. On a final note, it's a good sign that I don't need to say much about currency translation this quarter as going forward, it appears the impact will lessen. At current exchange rates, we expect the negative impact of currency translation in the second half of the year to be about $0.04, a nice change from the $0.17 impact we saw in the first half. More specifically, at today's rates we expect a negative $0.06 impact in the third quarter, turning to a positive $0.02 impact in the fourth quarter for a net negative of $0.21 for the full year. It's no question that the current economic environment is challenging and we are not completely immune from its effects. As we have said before, we are not recession proof, but we are recession resistant. We offer products and experiences that customers continue to want today, tomorrow and well into the future. We are leveraging our unmatched operating, development, and financial strengths to continue to increase our leadership position around the world. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for questions. (Operator instructions). And the first question is from David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS: Hi. In the \u2013 Ralph, in the U.S., the McCafe launch has been successful, you've said in terms of your internal projections and goals, in terms of sales mix. I'm wondering if you could talk about how that's turning out in terms of the overall top line. Obviously, you are gaining a lot of share versus the market, but as you think about the balance of your marketing spend and your overall focus on this initiative, do you think in some way this might \u2013 there might be a kind of a side negative impact that could be the lack of support that you are offering other core products? And perhaps, how could you \u2013 when you think about lapping the Southern Style chicken sandwiches introduction last year, do you think that that product is perhaps coming off of that honeymoon introduction period and that's perhaps providing a little bit of a headwind? Again, as you are getting the sales mix up on McCafe, maybe something else is dropping like the Southern Style chicken sandwiches introduction last year. Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: David, we don\u2019t think so. Again, we don\u2019t have all the \u2013 it will take six months before we can get the really good data to understand how much of the business on the McCafe is incremental, how much is tradeoff, et cetera, et cetera since we just started advertising in mid May. But what we did do is to ensure that didn\u2019t happen and we were fortunate this year because of the media cost. We had a stronger wait against core menu in supporting Big Mac as we had the year before supporting core menu. So we did not give up wait, at least on broadcast media, obviously, to give up some \u2013 the store-level exposure, but on a broadcast media point of view, we doubled up on our advertising in order to protect the other 95% of the business, which is really what drives everyday success. So \u2013 when you combine all of that with what's going on economically, what's going on in IEO, it's hard to separate the pieces and I'd only be guessing so I just wanted to be able to give you that type of information.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, thanks. The next question is from Keith Siegner at Credit Suisse.\nKaren Elmhirst \u2013 Credit Suisse: This is actually Karen Elmhirst [ph] for Keith today. We've seen some other retailers and restaurants who've been able to leverage just into the economy and generally weak commercial real estate environment into some rent reductions from their leasers. Did you feel any pressure from your franchisees or your franchise sub leasers to do the same thing?\nRalph Alvarez: We have not. We \u2013 and we've got long-term agreements with our franchisees. Their cash flows are at all-time high. Obviously, we are growing our results. What we have done is we've been out there very aggressively communicating with our landlords that potentially would prefer to have cash and sell a lot of that lease and we\u2019ve been a buyer in the marketplace, buying land that we then control forever. On a secondary basis, in markets like the U.K., U.K. is the biggest one, where rents are set or reset every five years based on market, obviously the market conditions have softened and that will help what those rents are going to be set out here over the next coming years.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. Next question, David Tarantino from Robert Baird.\nDavid Tarantino \u2013 Robert Baird: Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more perspective on the slowdown in comps you saw in Europe and APMEA in June. Was it broad based across countries or were there specific areas of weakness? And generally, with July getting better, is there anything you are doing tactically to make that happen or do you think we are just starting to see a little bit more stability? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. David, I'm going to start with APMEA first. The slowdown in APMEA was really Japan and China. Japan, we don\u2019t consolidate those results, it doesn\u2019t have a large operating income effect, but Japan was very weak in June and slightly better in July, but still has brought the numbers down from where APMEA was in and what Japan ran at first five months of the year. China, as we mentioned, continues negative, even though they had been negative, but June was weaker than it had been the first five months. Turning to Europe, our Europe business is stronger in July than it was in June. You get some of the holiday changes and it was a hot June, but we had \u2013 Germany was slightly weaker, we knew that. We had some coupons last year that we decided not to float at the same time this year and because of our emphasis on everyday value and so, we knew we were going to have a little bit of an impact and \u2013 but the rest of our Europe business is strong and continues strong \u2013 actually stronger in July. And so \u2013 IEO is down 4% in Europe for the first quarter. The second quarter data is not out, but we don\u2019t think it's going to be much different based on the data we get from other sources and \u2013 so we are not getting helped by the IEO category. We are obviously benefitting from both \u2013 we've got a very strong brand in Europe and we are basically the category from a QSR point of view.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. The next question is from Jeff Farmer at Jefferies.\nJeff Farmer \u2013 Jefferies: Great. Thank you. Just coming back to coffee for a second, I think in the past you guys have indicated that you expected your combined beverage initiatives to add about $125,000 per unit. So I guess that you recognize that you are right in the middle of that, there is a lot of beverages in play, but where do you stand in terms of hitting that $125,000 target today?\nRalph Alvarez: We are on target and that\u2019s why I said we are on target. That eventually does include some level of fruit drinks and smoothies and the crushed ice drinks and frappes. So those two are both \u2013 again, high margin, good sale items that we won't be into till next year, but the pieces of what we talked about in the $125,000 [ph], which does not include not fruit drinks, coffee, obviously we had that already. It's on target.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. Next question is from Matt DiFrisco at Oppenheimer.\nMatt DiFrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer: Just a little detail about \u2013 Pete, what you expect in the U.S. with margins heading into the second half, given the minimum wage increase, what impact that might have on margins and do you expect to take price? And then also, if \u2013 just a follow-up to that last question about the crushed ice drinks, can you update us on the timetable, when we should expect that just start to get critical mass and begin the launch of a national program behind that again? Just update us on the quarter that you expect that to occur.\nPete Bensen: Matt, it's Pete. On the U.S. margin question, we don\u2019t expect there to be a significant impact from the minimum wage increase. Over half the states already have their state minimum wage set higher than the federal is moving to and our wages are pretty close to that in the other. So we don\u2019t expect a significant impact there. And so with wages not increasing that significantly and commodity costs moderating in the second half, we have less need to get to the menu board and do a lot with price. So we don\u2019t see a lot of activity in that regard in the second half. And regarding the rollout of the other beverages, we are going to start softly in late 2009 and then start to get into that in 2010. We don\u2019t have a fixed date exactly as to when those beverages will get in, but we want to obviously reap benefits of the investment we've made in the espresso based coffees, get that awareness up and let that product have time to get into the marketplace.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. The next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thanks. This maybe a bigger picture question, but your operating margins now are almost 30%, which is just astounding probably in absolute and they are up over 1,000 basis points since you began this restructuring back in '04. So how do you think about what a target is considering there is really nothing you could compare it to either your own history or another company and maybe just specifically, one is, what are the key drivers going forward that we get it higher than it is today and what's the risk that you need to actually reinvest? And I guess, maybe to make it specific to this core, you talked about Germany and the need for value and maybe a trade-down there. Is there a risk we might see near-term margin compression because of that negative mixture, particularly in Europe either because of customers creating that or because of you \u2013 of your own promotional activity creating that?\nRalph Alvarez: No, I \u2013 on the second one, we don\u2019t see \u2013 we think our margins are going to be better for the second half of the year. We don\u2019t have \u2013 the market where we have had some of that trade-down, as I mentioned, that is more obvious is in Germany. We've had some trade-down throughout all the economies. We are not pushing the premium products as heavy as we were before. They are not as big a part of our marketing calendar. And quite honestly, the other piece is, we are going to do a lot less price increases next year than we did the last two years because of what's happening with commodity costs and what's happening with just inflation in general. And so we don\u2019t expect that to \u2013 and thus price increases are the other things that create more trade-down. We ourselves won't be driving that. So we feel that margins are actually going to grow based on the stability of commodity costs that we see in the second half of this year and going into 2010.\nPete Bensen: And John, in terms of a target, we really don\u2019t have a target in terms of the operating margin. We think we can continue to grow that and as Ralph said, the margins will be key and driving comp sales off of that is really the key to our business in terms of our profitability and as we move to more franchising, it's less G&A intensive. So we get a benefit from that as well.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Buckley, BoA-Merrill.\nJoe Buckley \u2013 BoA-Merrill: Thank you. First, just a bookkeeping question. I think in the June sales release, you were expecting a gain on the Indonesian transaction and from your and from what you've said here today, it doesn\u2019t look like there was one. So I just want to verify that. And then secondly, talk a little bit again about the transaction counts. I saw the footnote data in the release and it indicated they were stronger in the second quarter than the first. So what kind of consumer activity are you seeing, is the consumer trading down within the menu or have you just run off on the price that \u2013 that's a restraint on the kind of counts which you expect going forward?\nPete Bensen: Joe, it's Pete. I'll talk about Indo and then Ralph can get into the transaction counts. But \u2013 really we had a gain, but it was smaller than we originally anticipated and when we included that with the Redbox gain together, they rounded to a penny instead of two and so there were really nothing significant there.\nRalph Alvarez: On the transactions, as I said, we've got three things working there. We've had some trade-down mostly from promotional high-price products that we ourselves are not pushing as much around the world and moving that \u2013 moving into core menu is a part of the \u2013 what's happened. We are taking less price and we'll take less price over the next year and but at the same time, we've had a slight uptick in guest counts, which we believe in a market share battle that is the battle. That\u2019s what needs to happen. So we had some quarters last year. If you looked at it where we may have had 70%, 65% of our sales came from average check. We are definitely back at the 50% level and maybe or will be below that level as we go into 2010.\nMary Kay Shaw: Next question is from Larry Miller, RBC.\nLarry Miller \u2013 RBC: Thanks very much. I just wanted to go back to that comment you made, Ralph, about the IEO being negative in June. It seems across the board in fast food, something has changed there with the U.S. consumer. You guys clearly see the consumer more than anybody else out there and I was wondering if you could shed any light on what you think is happening out there. Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: We don\u2019t know \u2013 we \u2013 and many of you wrote about it. We saw it. We saw it, it was an effective \u2013 we saw kind of when school let out. All of a sudden, we don\u2019t know how much of that was last year \u2013 we know we had benefit at last year from the incentive checks that went out from the government and back then, people weren\u2019t in saving mode, those dollars got out there and got spent. So we don\u2019t have good enough data yet to tell you, but we saw that slowdown and then we've seen a slight uptick in traffic since that initial hit and so, we like the fact that we are gaining market share. Obviously, we don\u2019t want IEO to be down. We want to gain market share when IEO is up. And we think the customer reacted, it was summer, gas prices were up, you didn\u2019t have the same component of investment checks out there that you had last year, customers saving 7%, unemployment is 10% or the gross figure you read at 16%. We think all of those things had an impact with the customer and from our point of view, we just need to make sure we are getting our piece of the pie in the meantime and we got to be very careful on price and we got to deliver outstanding service at this time.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is Steven Kron from Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. Hi, guys. One follow-up, I guess, on the margin question. It seems like you guys are pretty comfortable with the sustainability of what you are seeing in the U.S. given the expectations for the commodity outlook in the back half. In Europe I guess, certainly from the first quarter, which was down 70 basis points at the company level, back up to 10 basis points, my sense is that a lot of that has to do with kind of the easing of that transactional headwind. Can you maybe put some context around what the sequential improvement in that transactional headwind was? And then secondly, a follow-up I guess just to Larry's question on \u2013 in the U.S., how are the consumers using your menu differently? Are you seeing any change in mix that's concerning to you or the competitive environment adjusting how you guys are thinking tactically and is your decision to not go national from an advertising perspective with Angus, is that because it's just the wrong time right now to be promoting something premium like that? Thanks.\nPete Bensen: Steven, it's Pete. I'll talk about Europe margins a little bit and then Ralph will follow up on the U.S. question. Compared to first quarter, one of the big drivers was our comp was significantly better in the second quarter compared to the first. So that helped our margin improvement along with the softening of the commodity costs a little bit. The Eastern European imports actually was relatively similar in terms of its impact, but we did \u2013 we were able in some of those markets to get a little more aggressive in price to help offset some of that, but not significantly. Really, it was the better comps than the weakening of the commodities that really were the two big drivers.\nRalph Alvarez: And thus, we expect that to be helpful in the third and fourth quarter with what we know is happening with commodity costs in Europe. As far as the U.S. \u2013 first on the Angus to clarify, we are going to nationally advertise Angus. We just haven\u2019t started that yet. So I just to want to make sure that was out there, we are in what we call soft launch where we make sure that we have all \u2013 we are doing the right things operationally and we get supply to all the corners of the country, but we will be in a national launch period coming up here soon. The \u2013 on the trade-down piece, we are not seeing anything sequentially in a big way out there that changes. We have gone to advertising more core, we were \u2013 for example, Big Mac versus bringing in premium chicken sandwiches last year for items like that. Obviously, Angus goes against that. Timing is not perfect on Angus I'll tell you, but customers love the product. We've been sitting on the sidelines with it, it's something that we wanted to put out there and we know it will help average check and we know that customers that trade from our core menu to them really think highly of the product. So we felt that was \u2013 again, the time for us to go out there. It was a gap in our menu and so we'll do that. But there isn't something on the tradeoff pie piece that would be concerning other than resistance to price increases if \u2013 that you can't cross that line.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays: Great, thank you. Actually, this is just a question on cost cutting efforts, which has been a theme across the industry lately. Sounds like your peers are perhaps slowing their unit growth and seeing some pretty significant cost benefits from, I guess, the removing of the cost of growth. I know you guys have been focused on managing your G&A down. I\u2019m just wondering whether there are any other major cost cutting opportunities or initiatives you see within your business to support the earnings growth perhaps during this stretch, whether there is any quantifiable target. And then separately, I know it's too early to look at 2010, but any comments on kind of a bigger picture returning of cash to shareholders. I know $15 billion to $17 billion is kind of running out. I didn\u2019t know whether we'd get a similar type promise in the coming quarter or whether you might predict more of a one-year type plan. I\u2019m just wondering whether you think it will be higher or lower based on kind of the current trend that we are in.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. Jeff, on the G&A side, we try to stay away from the pendulum swings on the G&A piece and so, we continue to work at it on a regular basis. We are down \u2013 first half of the year, we are down 4% on a constant currency on G&A. Some of that is a benefit of not having an Olympics year and our convention. But we are still giving increases to people, we are not cutting benefits, we are not doing any of that. So it is a headcount reduction both from the efficiencies of a more franchise organization and just being more efficient with the people we have. We have retirements or situations similar to that. We continue to get more efficient. And that's the way we are going to go at it. We are not going to go at one particular item. The \u2013 and then I'm going to throw it to Pete for the money question.\nPete Bensen: Yes. Jeff, we are not ready to give a target or talk specifically about 2010 per se, but you can expect there is not going to be a dramatic change in our business model and we are going to continue to generate a significant amount of cash and as I said in my remarks, we are going to continue to invest in the business because we are getting great returns. And after that, we like to fund the dividend and then buy some shares.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.\nGreg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup: Great, thanks. Hi, just a follow-up on China. You mentioned that there is sort of a temporary impact from the macro that we've all kind of heard about. And I was just wondering maybe when you would expect a pickup there and also, I know there is not a lot of data, but maybe just some color on market share changes in that market?\nRalph Alvarez: Okay. Yes, the \u2013 all of China has been impacted, but like I mentioned, the South \u2013 and that's our stronghold. 40% of our business is down, basically centered around Guangzhou and that's the factory haven of \u2013 for the world. That's where the impact has really happened and we felt it there and \u2013 we chased some of that business initially if you guys remember, about six months ago when that started happening. And it hurt margins and we made a decision to \u2013 we are stronger in value, we'll give it up a little bit average check in that area, but we are not giving that house away. And that's an important piece because we do believe this is going to come back and you have to establish a brand for the long term. The rest of China is not faring that poorly, commodity costs have really swung around. We've got a really strong management team and so good in-restaurant controls. The only other impact that it did to us on a temporary basis is, we pulled back on some of the openings that we had in the South because we want to wait for \u2013 understand where the factories reopen and the population shift to occur again, but we are very confident on it. We are getting excellent returns; our margins are at, for us, at all-time highs in China. So overall, we are strong on it. On the market share side, I don\u2019t have any updated information. The data from there is not as robust as the monthly type stuff that we get in the U.S. and Europe. So we don\u2019t have any recent data. You can look at our comps and you can look at the other couple of big players there. They are pretty similar, where those numbers are right now. So \u2013 and the growth numbers, my gut says share is about the same.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan: Thanks. Actually, just \u2013 first a follow-up and then a question. Ralph, it seems like you are alluding to commodity cost staying relatively flat in fiscal '10. Did I hear that correctly? And secondly for, I guess anybody, if you could update us where we are in the remodel cycle in the U.S., maybe what percentage of the system are you doing in \u201909, 2010 and what kind of sales lift are you seeing from that project?\nRalph Alvarez: Yes, first up, on the commodity costs, John, we \u2013 early read on '10 is stable. So we are not giving any predictions on it yet, but there is nothing out there either on significant drops in acreage of head of cattle or demand change or any of those items that we had seen in the past that you knew what was \u2013 that something was coming through that was changing. And so, we \u2013 right now it looks like a fairly stable first part of '10. The second piece \u2013 on the remodels in the U.S., I'm sorry. Yes, the U.S., about 40% of the restaurants were touched with the reimagining program that we had that ended about a year and a half ago. And so, there is significant work to be done. We are further ahead in places like Australia, we are almost done Germany, we are done France where we are fare ahead. So it's an opportunity for us in the U.S. obviously. We needed to do some things in the kitchen in the U.S. to deal with the huge growth in the drive through business over last ten years. And so, the combination of that which we tied in together with the beverage initiative was a priority the last 18, 24 months. At some point here, we'll go back to getting on a regular cycle with the U.S. to make sure that our brand is as contemporary as we want our products and our advertising to be.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, thank you. The next question is from Jason West at Deutsche Bank.\nJason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Yes, thanks. First, just wondering if Ralph, you could clarify the comment you made about doubling up advertising I think when you were talking about Big Mac and McCafe. And then secondly, just if you could talk about the overall competitive environment in the U.S.? Does it feel like things are still sort of decelerating to the downside there or \u2013 and how does the current environment feel relative to back in '02 when I believe we were in a similar kind of environment? And if you could just touch on the value menu mix, if that's still at 10%? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes, on the advertising piece, as you know, rates have come down in a pretty big way on the advertising side. Many of those savings, we translated into additional gross rating points and outdoor billboards, so it's not just TV, it's using other mix of media, magazines and some of these are down more in order to be able to \u2013 when I said double up, being able to have an adequate reach in frequency message for McCafe and the same thing for Big Mac, advertising or core menu advertising. As a company, we threw in some dollars also, which are reflected in our margins and our franchise margins to make sure that we had that as the operators have done on their side of the investment. So it was a combination of better rates and some additional spending in order to both drive a new business and protect the core. On the competitive situation, it hasn\u2019t changed much. On the real estate side, nobody is building units of the freestanding kind. And so, we are still out there kind of with building 140, 150 a year on the freestanding side, but \u2013 and with very little competition for those sites. But as far as, the rest of the category, the menus are about the same, our product mix is about 10%, it hasn\u2019t moved much on the dollar menu side and I would say there is more couponing on the direct mail side, et cetera going on, but in general, in our category, that's so convenience driven. That doesn\u2019t have much of an effect.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Tom Forte at Telsey.\nTom Forte \u2013 Telsey: Great, thank you. I wanted to get a little more detail on the consumer. You just mentioned a percent of sales from the dollar menu. I\u2019m wondering if there is any change in percent of sales from the core menu and how that's trended really since the recession has started. Also wondering if you are seeing any difference on breakfast versus lunch and dinner. And then lastly, you made some comments before on Michigan, California and Florida. I think at Michigan, you rolled up McCafe early. In California, I think you were benefitting from Sweet Tea and some other beverage initiatives. I can\u2019t recall what you said on Florida. I was wondering if you could give us some comments on those areas to give a feel for what sales is like or what the consumer is like in some of the more challenged markets. Thank you.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes. I\u2019ll start out with the last question, geographically. Our business is pretty steady across the country. Our tactics are different. So I can tell you, we are up in Michigan on an overall basis. Our business is up in Michigan, which is remarkable, but we are much more aggressive on price in Michigan than we are in other parts of the country and need to be in order to have that level of traffic. Florida and California stabilized last year and we saw pretty good sales last year, partly making up for going again some really soft numbers from the year before, but we don\u2019t have a significant variance across the geographies right now. On the menu side, all five of our day parts that we measure, were up for June. So the latest mug that we have and so the slowdown we saw quite obviously hit all day parts, it wasn't concentrated one place or the other. We have some benefit during the breakfast timeframe because we are advertising coffee, but if you take that out, the rest of breakfast may have slowed down some, but would still be positive just like the whole day part.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Speiser of Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham: Thanks very much. Just a clarification and a question, just on the stable commodity food cost outlook for 2010. When you say stable, does that mean theoretically kind of flat year-over-year or stable meaning that up 3% to 3.5% that you are expecting here in '09? And separately, can you just clarify on the U.S. comps? It sounds like you are saying that traffic has pretty much been steady, but it has really been the check that has come in. And maybe more specifically, the traffic trends from say first quarter to second quarter, and maybe from June to May, has it been steady and it has been the check that caused the deceleration in the comp? Thank you.\nRalph Alvarez: First, when we say stable, meaning it's \u2013 the 3.5% this year, we don't consider stable, because it was 6% to 7% in the first half of the year and 1% or flat in the second half depending on U.S. or Europe. Stable meaning that it will grow whatever the inflation is in general in the marketplace. This is what we mean by stable. So if we are back to a 1%, 2% inflation and that is what we would expect. If it is a 2% to 3%, depending on where CPI goes to, that's what we mean by stable. On the U.S. business, while average check did slow down, the transactions have been positive, but they did not grow in the second quarter versus first quarter. They were fairly constant.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. The next question is from Rachel Rothman at Wedbush.\nRachel Rothman \u2013 Wedbush: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on your commercial real estate question. I think you had some commentary on the U.S. about people not building. We've heard that of some of the other sectors that we covered, their commercial real estate development globally has slowed barely materially. And can you talk a little bit about whether or not you are seeing something similar internationally, maybe specifically in India or in China or in some of your developing markets and then whether or not that would have an impact on the pace of unit growth going forward, and I know you guys are growing much slower than some of your peers, but it is still a large number of stores. Thank you.\nRalph Alvarez: Yes, Rachel, on the \u2013 in the U.S., it did affect \u2013 we had allocated more capital this year beginning at \u2013 or at the end of last year to grow more restaurants in the U.S. Quite obviously, we grow more if we could get the sites, but planned unit developments are way down. And so, that has had some effect, we're still going to build, like I said, 140 or 150 freestanding units. We would have done more, but they are just not there. So it is definitely an issue in the U.S. That's not necessarily the same type of developments that we go in Europe. When it comes to Asia, and specifically in China, one of the reasons we didn't grow at the rate that we did is more than half our restaurants there are non-drive through, they are part of commercial center-type of scenarios. Some of those aren't being built, especially in the South and so that affected some of our growth. But China still \u2013 the real estate market in China is still broad. Their GDP is still up overall, they are still pumping money into construction; it was more of an isolated issue in the South. And India is not a big enough market for us. We are building I think 30-some restaurants there this year and I don't know enough to give you more than that.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. The next question is from Jeff Omohundro at Wells Fargo.\nJeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary coming out of Europe. You mentioned the market share gains, for example in Germany continuing. I am wondering though about the pace of gains in light of some increased promotional activity by competitors. What your sense is in terms of the level of promotion, whether McDonald's might want to respond? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: We have been pretty aggressive in Germany. And so, I don't know that we will respond beyond where we are right now. We've got a very strong everyday value menu there that is over 20% of our sales. We strategically do mailers, freestanding type inserts in Germany. They work there; it drives people out versus what may happen in other places. And so, we've got a \u2013 we are pretty aggressive in that marketplace already that way, at a rate that still provides really strong margins, our volumes are \u2013 and customer accounts are pretty high in Germany. So we don't see \u2013 and it really isn't competitors of enough size of \u2013 in the category to take us off of our program. The consumer there is just \u2013 they have cut back. I mean, the German GDP is highly dependent on manufacturing, it is 47% of GDP, it's way down, depending on what you look at rates, it's down double digits and they go into saving mode and so you have to be out there with value in order to have them and we will be as strong as we need to be to continue to take market share there, because it's a very resilient customer, it could \u2013 they come back pretty fast when things turn around.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. We have another question from Paul Westra at Cowen.\nPaul Westra \u2013 Cowen: Yes, hi, good afternoon. And I just had a couple of follow-up questions on the U.K. I was wondering if you can give us an idea roughly where you perceive yourself to be on this multi-year turnaround and how much maybe longer we could expect such stellar performances, how far have you come to get personal profitability back to near-peak levels we are seeing elsewhere around the globe. I guess more specifically on the refranchising and remodel program, how many have you done and how many more have you got to go?\nRalph Alvarez: The U.K., as I said earlier, it's probably our best brand turnaround. Strong management team, I mean that's in the current environment continuing double digits on top of double digits. I just spent a week there and it's just impressive. We still have 50% of the restaurants and the majority of our drive-through restaurants to be reimaged. So we started first with the in-line high street locations, because even though they are actually lower-volume more-profit locations, they are our highest exposure, they get more eyeballs than your drive-through ones and so we actually reversed what we normally do and did those remodels first in order to make a brand impact. And now, we are coming around the backside and hitting the \u2013 it went to about 200, maybe 230 this year. We need to do that for another two, two-and-a-half years in order to get the rest of the estate reimaged. On the refranchising, we are at 55% franchised there. At one point, we were only 30% and we are not going to rush into it, but our target probably is around 70% of the restaurants will be in franchisees hands and that \u2013 it may take us another two to three years, because they have to have the ability to handle the debts and do the reimaging at the same time. And so we're making sure that is a balanced approach so one \u2013 neither one of those suffer.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. It looks like we have one final question in the queue, Larry Miller from RBC.\nLarry Miller \u2013 RBC: Yes, thanks. On the McCafe \u2013 final thing, it's our understanding that sales are a lot stronger in the West than the rest of the country and I was just curious why that is and is that more of an opportunity to grow sales in the other parts of the country or is it just what it is? Thanks.\nRalph Alvarez: I don't know if it is what it is, but in general, we always sold more coffee out West than we did in the East, so we expected that and it's \u2013 and we expect that in the initial, just trial \u2013 especially those that just convert from being \u2013 we do higher breakfast sales that way and the category is not as well developed. And so we think over time, those are things that will change, but it was in our numbers that we wouldn't be as strong out East or South as we would be out West on the coffee business. We think that's a longer-term trend to change.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, thanks everyone. I will turn it over to Ralph for closing comments.\nRalph Alvarez: Thanks again for joining us on the call this morning. We are pleased with our strong performance for the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, a sequential improvement from our results in the first quarter and we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver for the remainder of 2009 and beyond. Thanks and have a great day.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-04-22 17:14:15", "content": "Executives: Mary Kay Shaw \u2013 Vice President Investor Relations James Skinner \u2013 Chief Executive Officer Ralph Alvarez \u2013 Chief Operating Officer Peter Bensen \u2013 Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Jeff Farmer \u2013 Jefferies Steve West - Stifel Nicolaus Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley David Tarantino \u2013 Robert Baird Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America David Palmer \u2013 UBS Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Gregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citi Lawrence Miller \u2013 RBC John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P.

(Operator Instructions) I'd like to turn the call over to Miss Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation.\nMary Kay Shaw: Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on our call today are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner, Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen and Chief Operating Officer, Ralph Alvarez. Ralph is joining us via phone from the U.S. Regional Operators Association Meeting. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Those documents are available on investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with our corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJames Skinner: Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that McDonald's delivered strong first quarter results. Global comparable sales were up 4.3%, operating income increased 5% in constant currency and EPS reached $0.87, a 17% increase in constant currency. Our sales momentum is continuing with April comparable sales trending at least as strong or better than the first quarter in every area of the world. McDonald's is well positioned for continued growth. Our global system is aligned around the right strategies to manage in the current global economic environment and to seize future opportunities. We remain focused on our customers and restaurants through our plan to win. Everyday, customer relevance is job one at McDonald's. We all know the state of today's consumers. They're scaling back and being more discerning about what they purchase. This means a strong value proposition is critical, from price to product, to experience. McDonald's offers strong value across our entire menu board. Our value menus around the world offer predictable, every day affordability and our core menu, including iconic products like the Quarter Pounder provide great value at the mid tier. This tiered pricing across the board value means we are in a position to grow our market share not only in the near term but in the long term as well.  In addition to great tasting core menu offerings, we continue to offer the choice in variety our customers want; new sandwiches and beverages from the cafe coffee here in the U.S. to regional burgers like the Parmareg in Italy appeal to our existing customers and bring in new ones. We're able to provide this quality, choice and value because of our global supply chain. The collaborative relationship we have with our suppliers is a true competitive advantage, enabling us to obtain and secure quality and quantity of ingredients we need in a competitive and relatively predictable prices. To deliver the best experience to our customers, we have to get even better at the basics of our business. That's why we continue to strategically invest in our restaurants so we can continually improve both operations and ambience. We know we're making progress. Our customer satisfaction scores are improving in nearly all of our major markets. Additionally, initiatives to make McDonald's even more convenient such as extended and 24 hours drive through enhancements and delivery strengthen our relevance and drive sales. These strategies are playing out successfully in every area of the world. In the United States, we're managing well in spite of the economy.  Our convenient locations and extended hours, great tasting food, strong value and continually improving customer experience make us a part of so many consumers every day lives. Our continued emphasis in these areas has served us well. In Europe, we continue to see good sales results in most of our markets despite the negative impact of the Easter shift and one less day due to Leap Year. Of our big four markets, France, the U.K. and Russia remain strong. In Germany, our brand is strong. We have a good management team in place and we continue to gain market share. The sales in this country were soft for the first three months of 2009 primarily as a result of the economy. However, they improved month to month during the quarter. In fact, March was positive despite the Easter holiday shift and the sales trend is even stronger in April. And, I'm confident we will manage through the current European environment as we have in the past. Results remain strong in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and were led by continued strength in Australia where most of our restaurants have been re-imaged and represent our brand very well. In addition, the majority of our Australian restaurants have a McCafe and we continue to have new product news. Japan as you know is also performing well, but we have seen a slow down in China due to the economic environment there. We remain confident however, in the long term growth potential for China and are doing the right things to drive sales and profit today and well into the future. In addition to our Plan to Win strategies around customer relevance, strong financial management contributes to our profitability and returns. Our disciplined approach to controlling costs and investing to grow the business provides flexibility and strength. As a result, we have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry. This allows us access to capital when we need it and provides our owner operators continued access to the credit necessary to reinvest in their restaurants.  Our financial strength is also a positive for our shareholders. We are on track to meet our three year target of $15 billion to $17 billion of cash returned to shareholders by the end of 2009. To date, we've given back $12.9 billion towards this target. In the first quarter, we bought back 14.6 million shares totaling $823 million and paid a dividend of $0.50 per share for an additional $553 million.  Looking ahead, I'm confident we will maintain our momentum by continuing to focus on our customers and restaurants and the financial discipline that drives our growth strategy of being better, not just bigger.  Thank you. And now I'll introduce Ralph Alvarez, our Chief Operating Officer.\nRalph Alvarez: Good morning. We're pleased to report that each area of the world is contributing to our strong business performance and we grew market share in every major country. In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter were up 4.7% and operating income grew 6% to $725 million. The strong comp sales drove both U.S. company operated and franchise margin improvements. The company operating margin increased 50 basis points and the franchise margin was up 30 basis points. Our McOpCo margin growth benefited from the refranchising strategy partially offset by higher commodity and occupancy costs. Our support of iconic core products continued to deliver results. First quarter advertising focused on the Quarter Pounder with cheese and we are still benefiting from the McNuggets promotion at the end of last year. The emphasis on core products has generated average check growth and increased restaurant profitability. The U.S. business also remains on track with the roll out of McCafe Beverages. This summer, we'll be advertising beverages, core favorites like the Big Mac and strong value offerings like dollar drinks, dollar menu and chicken snack wraps. Our U.S. business has excellent momentum and will continue to deliver results. In Europe, we continue to take market share despite a decline in Europe's informal eating out category. Europe's comp sales for the quarter were up 3.2% despite an almost two point hit from the shift of the Easter holidays and Leap day impact. Their sales have been driven by three and four price tier menus, the mid time food events as well as extended hours. Restaurant re-imaging and a strong focus on drive through execution is improving our brand performance.  While Europe's top line has remained solid in most markets, margins have been impacted by several factors. On the franchise side, our re-franchising strategy helped grow franchise margin dollars but negatively impacted the margin percent. This strategy has the opposite effect on company operative margins. It helped the percentage but reduced the dollars. Europe's franchise margin declined 130 basis points in the first quarter with 70 of those points due to the re-franchising strategy. This impact will lessen as the year continues. Higher occupancy costs and sales building incentives also impacted margins. However, this impact will also decline in future quarters. Europe's company operating margin declined 70 basis points. All of this and more was a result of the margin declines in Russia and our Eastern European markets. While their sales were strong, commodity costs were higher because these markets import 30% to 50% of food products denominated in either Euro or U.S. dollars. The net effect of these countries was a 200 basis points impact on Europe's margins.  While the currency volatility in Russia and Eastern Europe is challenging, the long term opportunity remains strong. We continue to capture market share and will grow new restaurants at an appropriate pace. In summary, with Europe's strong base line momentum and decelerating commodity costs, we are on track for another strong year.  Now, let's turn to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Comparable sales were up 5.5% for the first quarter and operating income increased 11% in constant currencies. Results were led by strong performances in Australia and Japan. Australia's success was driven by a focus on chicken and Japan's reintroduction of the Quarter Pounder menu contributed to its momentum. In addition, our convenience initiatives of 24 hours, drive through's and kiosks continued to positively impact the business. Markets are also aggressively working to ensure value initiatives are strategic, branded, and support base line growth. In the first quarter, the franchise margin in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa improved 120 basis points. This was driven by the relative impact of foreign currency translation and the comp sales growth. Company operating margins decreased 80 basis points primarily due to softer sales in China. Economic weakness in China has impacted our sales and margins, especially in Southern China where many factories have closed. Still, our underlying business remains strong in China. We are confident in this market's long term potential and are ensuring that we maintain traffic momentum through a strong focus on value pricing and strong operations. We will continue to open new restaurants. We opened 62 in the first quarter with an expectation that 140 will be built this year, slightly down from our previous estimate of 175. In closing, our position as a strong market leader in just about every country where we operate is an advantage we continue to leverage. Our business momentum is strong, costs are moderating and we continue to reinvest in our restaurants for long term success. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Bensen.\nPeter Bensen: Good morning. By now our headlines should be pretty clear. McDonald's global business is fundamentally strong. Our better, not just bigger approach continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of weak global economies, our consumer relevant strategies drove system wide sales up over 6% in constant currencies in the first quarter. This contributed to consolidated restaurant margin dollars reaching nearly $1.9 billion, up 3% in constant currencies. Company operated margin dollars accounted for 30% of this total and declined primarily due to the impact of refranchising. As a percent of sales, company operating margins declined 30 basis points to 16.2% as increases in the U.S. were more than offset by declines in Europe and Asia Pacific. As Ralph said, Europe's decline was primarily due to the impact of importing goods in Russia and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific's decline was mainly due to China. Franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies to $1.3 billion representing 70% of total consolidated restaurant margin dollars. This is up from 67% last year and 64% in first quarter 2007, reflecting our evolution toward a more heavily franchised structure. Since 2007, we've refranchised about 770 restaurants including about 90 in the first quarter. The shift explains in part why constant currency franchise margin dollars are growing at a faster rate than company operated margin dollars, a pattern we expect to continue as we refranchise more restaurants. As a percent of revenues, consolidated franchise margins in the first quarter were flat at 81.4% driven by strong global comparable sales offset by the impact of refranchising and operator incentives. Our evolution toward a more heavily franchised structure reduces total revenue dollars. This is because we collect rent and royalty income as a percent of sales from a franchise restaurant instead of 100% of sales from a company operated restaurant. The benefit of such a structure is a more stable and reliable cash flow and improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin. In the first quarter, combined operating margin percent increased 150 basis points to 27.6%, benefiting from refranchising and ongoing G&A control as well as currency translation. G&A declined 2% in constant currencies in the first quarter and is expected to decline for the full year although there will be fluctuations between quarters. We remain committed to G&A discipline and further increasing combined operating margin over time. Next, let me update you on a couple of other topics. Our commodity and currency translation outlooks; while commodity markets remain volatile, the global recession has dampened demand for commodities world wide, creating opportunities to reduce costs.  In the U.S., this is beginning to work its way through our suppliers as the quarterly increase in our grocery bill is down sequentially from 10% in the fourth quarter last year to 6.7% in the first quarter this year. We expect the cost increases in our basket of goods in the U.S. to continue to moderate for the remainder of the year. Our full year outlook remains for our basket of goods to be up 5% to 5.5% in the U.S. It's important to remember that we manage our basket like a portfolio, seeking to achieve the best overall results. Our goal here is to remain competitive and predictable. In the last couple of years this strategy resulted in our costs not rising to the same degree as either the commodity markets or the food component of the PPI, and it meant that we could consistently deliver value across our menu while achieving industry leading company operating margins. Consequently, you shouldn't expect to see the same level of decline in our grocery bill this year as you see in the cash markets since our base line is somewhat lower. And the 5% to 5.5% increase is our best estimate today, but opportunities remain within this projection, we're optimistic that we'll be able to finish the year at the low end of this range. Europe's basket of goods increased 9% in the first quarter. Similar to the U.S., we expect the cost pressures to lessen as the year progresses. Our full year outlook remains at 4% to 4.5% increase. These figures represent the weighted average for total Europe. However, with 40 plus countries, a number of different dynamics come into play. This was the case with Russia and Eastern Europe in the first quarter where commodity costs were disproportionately impacted by the significant weakening of local currencies. We've taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuation including purchasing goods and services in the local currency to the extent possible This helps create a natural hedge. However, due to the local supply chain infrastructure, Russia and many markets in Eastern Europe import 30% to 50% of their products. These purchases, primarily beef and chicken are denominated in either Euro or U.S. dollars. As a result of this, these markets are facing a more challenging commodity cost environment. Our opportunity to effectively hedge these exposures is significantly limited due to high cost and/or lack of an active market. We remain confident in the long term opportunity in Russia and Eastern Europe even as we navigate these short-term economic challenges. In addition to purchasing in the local currency where possible, we work to mitigate the impact of currency translation by financing our businesses locally as well as reinvesting a significant portion of our local earnings back into our international markets through capital expenditures. We also typically hedge a portion of the royalties we receive from our international markets. These efforts help to lessen the economic impact of fluctuating currency rates, but there will always be a financial reporting impact because of the need to translate international revenues and earnings to U.S. dollars. Since last year, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly against virtually all foreign currencies and has remained at a relatively high level. This resulted in a negative impact on first quarter earnings of $0.08 per share. The majority of this impact, about $0.06 was due to four currencies; the Euro, the Pound, and the Australian and Canadian dollars. These currencies declined between 13% and 27% versus the U.S. dollar since first quarter 2008. The next most significant impact was the Russia Ruble which was down 29%. The currency markets remain volatile and difficult to predict, but to give you some perspective, at current exchange rates, we project that currency translation will negatively impact both second and third quarter earnings per share by about $0.11 each, dropping to about $0.02 in the fourth quarter. And we know rates will continue to change. However, we hope this gives you some idea of our current expectations. Currencies tend to balance over time. Our focus remains on managing for the long term strength of our business as we navigate short term volatility. In closing, I think our first quarter results are a testament to the strength of our business model and its flexibility to deliver in a variety of environments. I'm confident we can sustain our global momentum and grow our business not only in the current environment but beyond. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your first question comes from Jeff Farmer \u2013 Jefferies\nJeff Farmer \u2013 Jefferies: As it relates to McCafe, I was looking for a little bit more color on what you've seen in the past when a new product transitions from the pre advertising to local advertising to national advertising phase. Do sales slowly build throughout all three phases? Is it a step by step function or do sales meaningfully accelerate when you go national?\nJames Skinner: It varies by product and introduction. We have a long history of course of introducing new products both in terms of testing and then rolling out nationally depending on what country you're in and then advertising when we get up to scale and it varies. But it changes based on the marketplace.\nRalph Alvarez: We had that modeled in our testing that we do for new product roll outs and usually when we do go to national, like Jim said, it varies by products depending if it\u2019s a completely new product that you're educating the customer or one that they're already familiar and you\u2019re just educating them about our offer at McDonalds.  But national ads, there's nothing like national advertising because you get to be in program advertising on prime network TV. That only happens on national and always stronger than what you could replicate locally.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Steve West - Stifel Nicolaus.\nSteve West - Stifel Nicolaus: How many McCafe's do you have right now in the U.S.?\nJames Skinner: Right now in the United States, we're right about the 10,000 stores and moving toward conclusion sometime in the middle of the year, May, sometime in that time frame.\nSteve West - Stifel Nicolaus: With China, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the shorter term? You mentioned you've got some pressure there. We're seeing some negative comps in February and March and what is really your short term outlook there for China and the same store sales results there?\nJames Skinner: We really have a long term outlook for China I think first of all, is the way we're looking at that marketplace with enormous opportunity. We opened our 1,000th restaurant there last November and even though there's a softening of the economy right now, we look at it for the long term and we're opening about 150 restaurants there this year. Our target was 175, but as the marketplaces develop around those additional sites, we'll be opening those as well. But we've opened 62 already this year and we're in it for the long term and managing appropriately relative to the environment we find ourselves in.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer.\nMatthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer: Can you also talk about, has anything changed with the timing as far as the ice machines, I guess for a lack of a better term, smoothies or what's also going to have the frapachino's or the frozen drinks in there, the timing of that. Would that be still middle of this year starting to see them rolled out in greater scale and also greater testing?\nJames Skinner: Yes. I think that's whatever we've said about that. I think we remain on track for rolling those additional items out throughout the remainder of the year.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Can you go back to the commentary on the European margins? Should we expect the pressure that you experienced from importing food to Eastern Europe, does that occur until we lap it through the next year or are you able to do something about that, either hedging or getting some alternate supply. And also, you mentioned that you've had some cost for sales building initiatives in Europe. How long are those? When did they start and how long do they persist and what are those initiatives that you are presumably funding for the franchisees?\nPeter Bensen: I'll talk about the company operating margins there and then Ralph will talk a little bit about the franchisee incentives.  We expect the costs of those imports to moderate as we move throughout the year. The fourth quarter is when we'll start to see the greatest decline. But as we mentioned, some of those costs are denominated against the Euro and those local currencies actually started depreciating against the Euro throughout the year last year. So it wasn't until late in the year that they started depreciating significantly against the U.S. dollar. So, we're probably seeing the peak of the impact from those imports here in the first quarter, but it will still be with us primarily for the rest of the year but to a lesser degree.\nRalph Alvarez: On the franchise side, the operator incentives we have in place, they'll moderate throughout the rest of the year. At the high end, they've been 30 basis points so it's not a significant piece of it, but it\u2019s something that we do with our operators, being in there together to drive new business.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from David Tarantino \u2013 Robert Baird.\nDavid Tarantino \u2013 Robert Baird: Could you comment on the breakfast trends that you've seen in the U.S. specifically and maybe a bit more broadly if you've seen any changes in the day part trends that you've been seeing as Q1 unfolded?\nJames Skinner: Breakfast has continued to contribute to our success here in the United States and wherever we're selling breakfast around the world in the various markets. Ralph do you want to talk a little bit about the breakfast day part?\nRalph Alvarez: Our U.S. breakfast business as we've talked about has been very strong for years. It continues to be positive on sales and guest counts this year. We're a leader in that area and if you've seen our advertising focus during the first three, four months, we've been advertising breakfast pretty heavily. So we continue to see growth in that area and it's a very profitable piece of our business.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America:  I'd like to go back to the European margins again with a couple of questions. You mentioned the refranchising activities there pulling down the franchise percent margin in Europe. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? Are you giving incentives to buyers of those properties? Is that what's sort of playing out? And then just go back on the company side, so if I understood what you said correctly, the entire company operating margin decline is related to the Russian, Eastern European pressure and X that you would have been up in other company operated markets in Europe in terms of percent margin?\nPeter Bensen: You interpreted those comments correctly on the company operating margins, that those Russia and Eastern Europe were more than the total decline. And on the franchise margin side, this is really, looking at some of the sales building initiatives that have been successful around the world, things like reimaging and 24 hours, what these incentives typically are, are reduced rent for a period of time to provide additional cash flow for the operators to invest in these initiatives which as you know, build really long term, sustainable sales for the future.\nJames Skinner: If I may add there, on the refranchising piece, the majority, there's a greater SKU of restaurants we're refranchising that had underlying lease properties versus purchase properties and those have significant lower margin. As those move on to the franchise side, it dilutes the franchise margin percent, so that's what you're seeing. We'll start lapping against some of the large amounts of restaurants we refranchised last year, and that's why you'll see that percent erosion moderate. The net net is significantly higher combined operating margin and a system that has more franchisees running our restaurants which we believe is very healthy for the customers.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS: You've had the dollar menu since late '02 and that's seemingly been enough for the value credibility of McDonald's and you've stayed away from discounting your premium items and large degrees of couponing as well. Do you think that might be ending and we'll have to end markets where you see traffic weakening like a Florida, Germany, where you're getting significant traffic pressure? In other words will you choose to defend share versus profit in select places? And secondly, given that competitors such as Wendy's and Burger King will have declining food costs, we believe in the second quarter, are you worried that others will push that discount button more readily heading into driving season?\nJames Skinner: I don't see our relationship of the every day affordability and the dollar menu and the value across the menu changing relative to our strategy. I think that we have value menus in every country around the world.  There are some markets where franchisees decide to do some additional marketing around value orientation of products, depending on what their current environment dictates, but I don't see us dictating any change in strategy around that. And then I don't see necessarily any concern at least on our part relative to what might happen with others and what they decide to do around this because of their declining food costs if you will, even though I don't know the details around that. But I really don't see anything changing in our relationship in terms of how we're going to market our value.\nRalph Alvarez: And just adding, Florida, business is very strong in Florida. Don't know about others, but ours is very strong and so we pulled the every day value, predictable every day value equation there now for the last 18 months and we're taking significant market share. And that's kind of what we do in all the areas of the world. Germany, we grew market share. Our business in Germany is high volume and we're making sure that we protect traffic as we deal in these type of environments right now.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs: One follow up on the McCafe question. What percentage of the product sales of the McCafe in the U.S. are at the breakfast day part versus other day parts? And then on the U.S. company operating margins, up 50 basis points year-over-year, that if I have my numbers correctly is the first time it's been up year-over-year since December '06 quarter. You mentioned refranchising a contributor to that but you've been refranchising for a couple of years. So if you could just drill down a little bit more as to the contributing factors there. Is there a product mix shift maybe with the double cheese burger or Mc Double or are there levers that you're pulling on controllable costs and the sustainability of that increase?\nRalph Alvarez: On the McCafe, it's more than 50% of the coffee happens at breakfast on the McCafe. There is some seasonality relative to McCafe as to the hotter, the cold drinks obviously, but it's definitely more of a breakfast as you would imagine. On the U.S. company operating margins, the switch to Mc Double from double cheeseburger helped the margins. The core menu advertising, non discounted, just our everyday strong values on Quarter Pounder with cheese and Mc Nuggets helped. We still had high commodity costs in the first quarter, so that offset it. That's why the rest of the year we feel very good about McOpCo margins in the U.S. as costs moderates and we have both of these pieces. The refranchising continues to help us. We refranchised around 400 or so restaurants last year in the U.S., and again most of those had underlying leases and so it's just a switch of that lease cost shows up on the franchise margin side not on the company side.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nJeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital: Just one follow up on the discounting and then a separate question. Regarding the discounting, I'm just wondering whether you think perhaps casual dining where they're doing significant discounting perhaps would take back some share or whether on the other end you might be losing to food at home where they're reducing prices. I know you're probably still running 4% plus menu pricing, so just curious on the outlook for that. On the balance sheet you mentioned obviously, we're coming close to the end of 2009 and the $15 billion to $17 billion is on target. I know you haven't put out targets beyond that, but I'm hoping you could talk maybe broadly about whether or not those types of levels are sustainable if the markets remain at the current levels? How about maybe debt pay down, just wondering about priorities.\nJames Skinner: I'll let Pete answer the question on projections, but when you're looking at the indexing of food away from home and the discounting that's going on by people who are selling products relative to food at home, and all of the other indexing that we take a look at relative to our trends in the business and our traffic and guest counts in the business, we're not really seeing any signs of impact relative to our share. As I had mentioned, I think we're, I think we are, we're growing share in every market we're operating in today, or virtually every market in this environment. So we're not seeing any impact of that right at the moment.\nPeter Bensen: Regarding the cash return targets, I think it's premature to give any specific guidance beyond 2009, but I think if you look at our business model, I think we'll continue to generate a significant amount of cash flow. We'll continue to invest significantly in the business at the great returns that we're generating. And the cash flow after that we'll use to pay dividends. We've shown a commitment to dividends and we believe those are important and we'll have some share buy back as well.\nRalph Alvarez: Just to reinforce the traffic piece from Jim, every major market in the first quarter grew comparable guest counts if you consider the impact of having one less day, and that's obviously market share is all based on traffic, and we continue to grow market share as Jim has said.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank.\nJason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank: I just wanted to touch on the international side a bit. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what's different about the Chinese consumer and what's going on in Germany, what has gone on there versus some of your other international markets that remain very strong. If you could talk about what the differences are and what gives you comfort that you're not going to see this kind of slow down spreading to other places as we move through the year?\nJames Skinner: Ralph has just been in those markets recently. Ralph, you want to talk a little bit about our consumers in Germany and China? \nRalph Alvarez: I'll take China first. In China, we grew traffic on a comparable basis besides the new stores for the first quarter, but we had average check decline and in China there are other convenient alternatives that are less expensive than western QSR and obviously than McDonald's and so that's a unique phenomena.  There's very few places in the world where you have that, so we're doing what we need to do to continue our long term traffic building there and as that economy turns around, those are loyal McDonald's customers. So that's unique to China and some other smaller markets, but none of our bigger markets. In Germany, the German consumer, first Germany is the European country of the big three that has had the largest GDP decline and that's impacted the psyche of the consumer there, and obviously their pocket book. So we've increased what's on our one Euro menu there to be more aggressive on that side and we will continue to advertise more heavily those types of items, but it's been again, unique to Germany.  That's the way their consumer is. We have high volume there so we just looked at the market share numbers for first quarter and we grew market share in a strong way, but just the IEO market in Germany declined at a pretty strong rate. So that's what we see, we're not seeing the same effect in our other large countries in Europe.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Gregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citi.\nGregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citi: Just keeping on Europe for a moment and Germany, it's a tough macro environment and you're gaining share. What's the competitive landscape? Are other people, other competitors starting to discount a little bit more and would you expect them to in order to keep up their share there?\nRalph Alvarez: Again, the issue in Germany is more of a consumer sentiment and what they end up doing. We've got a very strong position in the marketplace there, more than three times bigger than the next competitor on a guest comp basis. So it really is much more about what we're doing and how the consumer is feeling than it is about competitive actions in the marketplace.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Lawrence Miller \u2013 RBC.\nLawrence Miller \u2013 RBC: I have a couple of follow ups on what you were talking about. Why is it that we're not seeing the weakness in the U.K. because consumer sentiment there isn't strong, and also, I think as it goes back to China, you worked on a menu re-engineering in terms of prices. You're saying it's still weak there. Have you seen an improvement in the comp trend? I know it's a lumpy quarter because of the New Year's but I'm just curious if when you lowered those prices if you saw the desired response? And then related to the Angus test market results, it sounds like that's a product that you actually might roll this year. Can you give us a little color about shifting between the burgers on the menu and what the test market read is on that thing?\nJames Skinner: On the U.K. piece, we had a very strong quarter in the U.K. A couple of things are happening. First, our brand strength there over the last two years, it's the best turn around of our business anywhere. We've got a very strong management team. As you know, the media and the press there were not always on our side. That's changed significantly. We've reimaged a lot of restaurants and there have been some stimulus in the market place from government. They did a temporary reduction of VAT, that 2% reduction that happened in late December. That put a little bit more money out there for those that are spending, and so it helped retail sales and we're benefiting from that and continuing our trend. As I mentioned, we were looking at first quarter market share numbers in the U.K., very strong growth in market share for us. When you look at China and the prices, the reason for what we've done in China is as I mentioned earlier, the early signals there were some trade down from western QSR down to Chinese QSR and their meal prices for Chinese QSR were maybe 30% to 40% below what a traditional western QSR meal prices were. So we want to make sure at lunch that we became close to competitive in that area in order to limit trading out of the category into a different convenient option. So we like what we're seeing with what we've done. It's dilutive to margins obviously and to average check, but this is a long term gain and we're going to continue to make sure that we maintain that type of traffic. And relative to Angus, we will have Angus out in the U.S. market at some point this year We know what it can do from the different marketplaces and what as you've seen that we've done, we significantly increased advertising against our core menu, which has every day great prices on our extra value meals; Big Mac, QPC, Chicken Nuggets, and this is an option for those that are a little bit hungrier and want to spend a few more bucks. But the rest, it will be supplemented by strong value advertising at the same time.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Remaining on China, was the reduction in unit growth a function of less openings in south China, or is there something else that I should read into that given your positive long term view of the market? Are you changing formats, drive through's, what have you. And secondly on China, are you seeing the improvement in April relative to March that you're seeing broadly in the region or is there something different with China?\nJames Skinner: The slow down on the openings, it's 25 to 35 openings and much of it is in the south because a bunch of factories have been closed there. But it's sort of across the board really when you look at. When you reduce openings from 175 to 150, we're really looking at each of the market places and when the surrounding area is not developing appropriate to maintain pace with the opening, we have a slight pull back there.\nRalph Alvarez: Our trends are comparable. They're not stronger in April in China. And then one thing on the China development, it isn't necessarily we're pulling back on any format like drive through, we will actually open less drive through because those are usually in areas where we were counting on more infrastructure growth; homes, roads, etc. and that's where some of the pull back has happened and so there will be less drive through, but it\u2019s because of that, not because of we're changing the format of what we're opening.\nMay Kay Shaw: The next question is from Jeffrey Omohundro \u2013 Wachovia.\nJeffrey Omohundro \u2013 Wachovia: There's been a lot of discussion around value this morning, but looking at the more premium side of the menu and thinking of the Angus burger opportunity, do you see an opportunity for a bigger push on the premium side, perhaps to capture or further capture a trade down share?\nJames Skinner: I think the balance is going to remain about the same. As you know, we've been testing the Angus for awhile now in several markets and we held off actually in terms of moving that product to a national roll out. Whenever we decide to go for it, it's really going to continue to be an approach that balances out the menu relative to value across the menu including premium sandwiches and our iconic core sandwiches, and then the tiered pricing that we're using in the value menu. So it's really not a shift in strategy, but a continuation of the strategy.\nMary Kay Shaw: Your next question is from Tom Forte \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group.\nTom Forte \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group: I was hoping you could update us on the percentage of sales you're getting today from the value menu, from the dollar menu, and then also are you seeing any impact from competitors who rolled out their own dollar menus, Sonic or KFC. And when I think about same store sales for the June quarter, can you talk about how difficult a comparison you have given the roll out last year of Southern Style Chicken for breakfast, lunch and dinner?\nRalph Alvarez: On the dollar menu, obviously we've talked before where over 50% of customers stayed with the double cheeseburger at $0.20 more. What's dollar menu has dropped into the 10% range from the 14% type range we had talked before and so that's as I mentioned earlier, that's helped margins and it's maintained traffic. We're not seeing the competitive impact. We look at Crest Data which gives us a pretty good look at what other folks are doing and our value menu is the one with traction and so we continue to advertise it so customers know that their favorites are there and available and need to be top of mind.\nJames Skinner: Do you want to talk about the projection comparison?\nPeter Bensen: We don't project comps and while we had a successful launch of the Southern Style Chicken last May, we have a tremendous amount of momentum in the U.S. business and we feel comfortable that will continue.\nJames Skinner: The reality is if you look at our U.S. comp sales last year, they were 3% in the first quarter, 3.5% in the second, 4.5% in the third and 5% in the fourth, slight increases each quarter, but not significantly different. The range is from 3% to 5% and we're really going against very steady base line growth in the U.S., and we're building on that. We had a 4.7% in the first quarter this year even with the Leap Year impact.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham: It's a question on beverages in general and the McCafe. Relative to that 18.3% company operating margin in the U.S. in the first quarter '09 and about 18.5% for all of '08, will the incremental sales of specialty coffee products improve that margin? And on the allocation of advertising dollars, where do you see that coming from to market, the specialty coffee initiative?\nJames Skinner: I think if you take a look at the accretion to margins relative to McCafe, there's no question if we sold 100% of our sales were McCafe it would be accretive to the margin in a big way. But we haven't really sorted out the product mix yet relative to what will happen when we go to advertising on a macro basis, so it remains to be seen. The expectation of course would be that beverages would be beneficial to the margins.\nPeter Bensen: The second question was about advertising dollars and obviously we're seeing softness in the advertising markets, not only television but across all media, and we're going to use that as an opportunity to stay aggressive in getting our message out there and use that as an opportunity to do even more advertising. There's been a resetting of the base media cost across the industry and we're taking advantage of that opportunity to look at where our spend can either increase or remain the same and still get additional GRP's and reach to our customers.\nJames Skinner: To add a couple of things there on the company operated margins, an 18.3% in the first quarter which is obviously winter, is very strong margin in the U.S. and so it was a great performance by our U.S. business.  And on the advertising, we are very conscious of making sure that we are strong on our core menu advertising at the time that we're rolling out a new product that we do not get distracted on that, and we're fortunate with the current media environment that we'll be able to do both.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Howard Penny \u2013 Research Edge.\nHoward Penny \u2013 Research Edge: If you could just add on Angus to that as well in the media question. And then I have a question as to the composition of your comps. When you say your comps are up and changed, and you attribute that to chicken breakfast and beverages, can you provide of that 100% increase, 50% is breakfast, another 25% is beverages and chicken adds the balance. And when you talk about beverages and the cafe being 50% of the mix coming at breakfast, is that included in there when you look at the allocation of breakfast and how well breakfast is doing or do you wholly separate out beverages when you look at what it contributes to your comps?\nPeter Bensen: We don't get into that level of detail in terms of providing the drivers of the U.S. I think it's fair to say that all of those items are working together and as you know, they're consistent with the strategies that the U.S. business has followed because those are areas that we see huge opportunity in.  We're going to continue to focus on those and we think together those are going to continue to be big drivers of the U.S. business.\nJames Skinner: And on the Angus, Angus is much more part of our core offerings. It\u2019s burgers, it's beef. That's who we are, so we look at that as an extension of our burger line and something very close to what McDonald's stands for.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse: Just a follow up, one last question on China. Given the weakness that you've seen along the southern regions, does this change at all the strategy for how you approach the country? I think back in December at investor day you talked about going after the top 150 markets. Does this change the focus, broaden out the scope a little, really go for the long term, get into some of the smaller regions and maybe use franchisees a little more heavily as part of the growth? How might you approach that given what you've been seeing?\nJames Skinner: We at the moment are not changing our strategy. It remains the same and it's, when you look at China, and we're in this for the long term, just opening our 1,000th restaurant, yet it only represents about 2% of our operating income. So the long term strategy there remains.  We're looking at the big cities and we're not franchising there yet on a wholesale basis because we're still working on franchise laws and making sure that we have a viable franchisee model before we do that so we continue to be pretty much a company operated system there in China today.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Paul Westra \u2013 Cowan and Company.\nPaul Westra \u2013 Cowan and Company: I have a follow up question on the U.S. margins. I was hoping to get a little more detailed update on what line items you see as the greatest opportunity to delivery, improved margins over the next year or two, perhaps some specific efforts underway that can try to gauge how much more upside there might be to the McOpCo margin number. In light of the fact that I think that 18.3% number is better than a 20 year high, might theoretically limit upside but on the other hand we're seeing some significant leverage elsewhere in the restaurant industry by other competitors who have significantly worse business trends.\nPeter Bensen: We think our biggest opportunity is to continue to drive comp sales and our focus on the top line is going to give us the most leverage in the U.S. business and with the momentum we're seeing and the pipeline, we're very optimistic around the top line.  But structurally as we've said also, we expect commodity costs to moderate as we move throughout the years, so these higher commodities as they work their way through the supply chain will provide us with some additional benefit.  We're always looking at ways to be a little bit more productive from a labor side, and probably from a head wind perspective, there are national minimum wage increases coming later in the year. A great majority of our system is already over the minimum wage, so we don't see that as being a huge impact but it is something on the radar screen that we're looking at. But again, driving the top line is going to continue to be our greatest opportunity and we don't see the margins hitting some theoretical peak.\nRalph Alvarez: Not much more to add other than we don't expect the inflationary year we had last year. This year, it's not the long term trend, so that will always help in a business where we have a fair amount of fixed costs and get leverage off of sales growth.\nMary Kay Shaw: We have another question from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America: In China, going back to China for a moment, if the comp was negative for the quarter, I think the sense I got was that January, February on a combined basis were up, so sales can materially worse in March and if so, I'm curious what you think might have driven that? And then going back to the U.S., I guess Europe too, but the U.S. on the food costs side, are you locked in on some costs? Is there a reason you're not going to benefit from declining food costs? Because it seemed like through 2008 the food price inflation numbers kept rising pretty dramatically so you're definitely more susceptible to what was going on in the commodity markets in 2008. I guess I'm wondering why you wouldn't be benefiting from that at some point here in 2009.\nJames Skinner: I think we did say that we over the course of the year will benefit from it as it passes through our supply chain on the food cost in the United States and yes, we do some out contracts and some hedging as we've communicated in the past. But we expect to see some benefit from it as we move through the year.\nRalph Alvarez: Adding to the commodity costs, for one second is, proteins have not moderated in cost and that's a big piece of our menu. They're not growing at the pace that they were but there's less supply out there of beef and chicken and that's not allowing for the benefit that there is in some of the other commodities. That's what you'll see but it will definitely get better throughout the year. In China, March was not as strong as the combination of January and February.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from Jim Baker \u2013 Neuberger Berman.\nJim Baker \u2013 Neuberger Berman: I wanted to ask you about the other countries in the corporate line where it seems like you had about a $20 million reduction in restaurant margins and about a $14 million reduction in operating profits. If you could comment on what's happening in Latin America and Canada, particularly also on the corporate expense.\nRalph Alvarez: Our Canadian business, we don't have any company operated restaurants in Latin America anymore, but our Canadian business had a good sales and guest count a month. They got impacted by the commodity costs a little bit more up there, and we've been stronger on our value proposition for both breakfast and rest of the day as we're building our traffic. So company operated margins in Canada were dilutive to last year and that's what would show up in that area.\nPeter Bensen: Then also on the corporate side, the corporate G&A expenses are down as we continue to just exercise good G&A discipline and keep a watchful eye over that spend.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question comes from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: It sounds like going into summer you're going to start nationally advertising the specialty coffee or the McCafe business. Right now five of the seven products or the majority at least of the products are hot beverages and I think last summer you indicated that you'd seen the cuts per week slow down materially in the summer given the hot coffee doesn\u2019t sell well during that period. So the question is, is summer the right time to nationally advertise those products or a better time to wait till fall? Should we at least moderate our expectations of the initial impact of that advertising at the very least or do I have it all wrong?\nJames Skinner: We're not going to tell you when we're going to start national advertising, proprietary information. But there's never a bad time to nationally advertise a high quality product. So, we'll make that determination as we move through this period and as we get closer to what could be considered the time we would be able to launch this new product.\nRalph Alvarez: In addition to that, we've got a strong mix of ice coffee and frappes that are part of the, and the other cold drinks and we're going to be strong on drinks this summer, on cold drink advertising, as we were last summer. And so we'll make sure we strike that right combination, but our business, we definitely don't sell more of the hot items in the summer, but our business is much steadier than the rest because our customers are very regular. So like Jim said, we'll be out there all year when we've got a new product supporting it on a strong basis.\nMary Kay Shaw: We're out of time so I'll go ahead and turn it over to Jim for a few closing comments.\nJames Skinner: Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. In closing I want to emphasize that our global business in fundamentally strong and we are well positioned for continued growth. Our financial discipline remains in line with our growth strategy of being better not just bigger, and we are successfully controlling costs and at the same time investing to grow the business. Our systems ongoing alignment around our plan to win is producing measurable results in every area of the world. Customer relevant strategies around food, value, convenience and experience have earned us a place in consumer's daily lives.  I'm confident in our ability to sustain our momentum and continue to delivery long term profitable growth for our system and our shareholders.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to this Ms. Cathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corp. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nCathy Martin: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner; and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen; and Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson is also here for Q&A. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available on our website at www. investor.mcdonalds.com. As are any reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim.\nJim Skinner: Thank you, Cathy, and good morning. I'm pleased to report our business growth continued in the fourth quarter and that 2010 was another strong year for McDonald's. We continue to build our business, grow our market share and strengthen our connection with the customer.2010 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive comp sales in every area of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevancy of our Plan to Win business strategy.  Global comparable sales were up 5% for the quarter and for the year. And while we don't like to single out weather, in December, we experienced a severe impact. It's always difficult to quantify, but our best estimates are that the December comp was negatively impacted by 5% in Europe and slightly more than 2% in the United States. But it all indicates that our underlying trends remain strong. Despite these conditions, December global comparable sales were up 3.7%. In January, global comparable sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. In constant currencies excluding impairment and other in last year's Redbox gain, operating income grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the year. While EPS increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the year. Overall, the global economy is recovering slowly but it remains challenging and consumers are still cautious. We continue to succeed by understanding our customers and aggressively executing the right strategies of optimizing our menu with a range of consumer-driven offerings; modernizing the experience for our customers and crew through service upgrades and reimaged restaurants; and broadening our accessibility with more restaurants, convenient hours and outstanding value. This is our system-wide focus on to the Plan to Win and it's what helped drive our success around the world in 2010. It is this proven strategy and our unrelenting focus on the customer that will drive the business in 2011 and the years to come.  Looking at the U.S., comp sales increased 4.4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year with operating income up 1% and 7%, respectively. These results were achieved despite a tough economy and slow growth in the informal eating-out market. We continue to grow share, outpacing the competition on comparable sales and we continue to achieve all-time highs for comparable guest count growth during the period, when the overall industry traffic was contracting.  We drove results with a strong focus on value, menu relevance and convenience. We benefited from our Dollar Menu at breakfast which has been in place for over a year now and has increased morning traffic. This addition to our traditional Dollar Menu offering has boosted our position as a value leader across all dayparts.  Our expanded beverage program continues to bring in customers throughout the day and sales of our new fruit smoothies and frappes during the quarter continued to do well. This, coupled with the strong lift in hot McCaf\u00e9 offerings, including the addition of Caramel Mocha, drove December McCaf\u00e9 units up 20% over last year.  U.S. also delivered results by featuring our popular core products as well as our unique favorite, our famous McRib, which we offered for a limited time on a national level. Throughout the year, we featured our flagship products which offer great taste and value every day. December's focus on Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese and the Angus burger also added increased unit movement. And for the first time ever, we partnered with Walmart for our annual MONOPOLY promotion, resulting in a larger and more relevant prize pool. MONOPOLY lifted sales of featured core products like Big Mac and McNuggets as well as high-margin smoothies and frappes. And it drove Extra Value Meal units by more than 15%.  Now as we begin 2011, we're excited about our latest new menu offering, oatmeal, which we launched nationally this month. This great tasting product is an example of how we are continuing to grow our nutrition profile and meet our customers' evolving tastes. Also this year, the U.S. will continue rolling out our new point-of-sale system which simplifies the order taking process, improves accuracy and allows the crew to provide better service to our customers. It's currently in about a third of our stores and we plan to have it rolled out throughout the U.S. by the end of the year.  Now turning to Europe. Comparable sales were up 3.4% for the quarter and 4.4% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. In 2010, Europe reached an all-time high in informal eating-out market share at 9.5% and served 200 million more customers than the year before. We continue to take share with the overall market declining. The segment drove results with a compelling menu of signature offerings and new products across all price tiers, as well as through breakfast and by modernizing the restaurant experience.  Europe is leveraging learnings from across the system and growing its breakfast business. The U.K. finished the year with breakfast sales up more than 12%, largely driven by a sustained quality campaign around coffee. In Germany, the continued promotion of breakfast under the tagline \"easy morning\" helped build sales and drive traffic during that daypart.  McCaf\u00e9 is now in almost 1,300 restaurants in Europe and is helping to boost our breakfast business in a locally relevant way. In markets like Italy, where we now have more than 100 McCaf\u00e9s, our espresso-based coffee and pastry offerings are delivering exactly what the Italians are looking for at breakfast. In 2011, Europe will continue to expand McCaf\u00e9 in many markets.  On the menu front, France is a great example of meeting our European customers' expectations for value and variety. During the quarter, France drove sales with a Double Cheeseburger promotion in the introduction of its Tour Demain [ph] premium burgers with their variety of ethnic flavors. New food news and premium offerings also contributed to results in the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., food events highlighting the Big Tasty and Chicken Legend sandwiches each performed well. In Germany, the recently launched chicken and beef McWraps continued their strong sales. And sales results were above expectations for the new 1955 sandwich, a premium burger with a homemade look and gourmet bun.  Meanwhile, our service scores improve across Europe due largely to our new customer order displays which improve accuracy and speed at the drive-thru. Europe also remains leader in our reimaging efforts with nearly 70% of interiors and about 40% of exteriors remodeled, making our brand more contemporary and relevant. As I look to 2011, I'm confident that our strategies around service, value and optimizing our menu will continue to connect with consumers and drive our momentum well into the future.  Shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa or APMEA, for the quarter and year, comp sales were up 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Operating income also continued to grow, up 10% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. We're driving growth across the region through convenience, value and breakfast along with core offerings and compelling new menu news.  Building on our leadership position and value, many of our key markets are offering a Value Lunch program that fits the need of today's consumers. And the entire segment remains a system leader in customer satisfaction scores, helping us differentiate McDonald's in the areas of food quality and customer experience.  Australia continued to build on last year's strong comp sales as it achieved success with new items, including the November rollout of its Chicken McBites, which are a great-tasting sandwich for snacking and customers on-the-go. Early sales have exceeded expectations and are largely incremental to our popular McNuggets. In addition, Australia continued to grow sales in traffic at breakfast with the help of their Mighty McMuffin and new Breakfast Wrap, both of which deliver great tasting ways to start the day.  In Japan, while the economic environment and informal eating-out market remain challenging, our strategies are delivering positive results, as evidenced by Japan's 4.5% comps sales increase in 2010. Value breakfast launched mid-year, featuring Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, maintained its momentum into the fourth quarter and continued to grow sales and guest counts. And December's re-hit of the popular Texas Burger helped Japan deliver a strong finish to the year.  Turning to China, we remain committed and confident in our long-term success in this market. In 2010 we opened 166 restaurants, bringing the total to nearly 1,300. In 2011, we will grow the base of restaurants by about 15% or 16% toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013. China's comparable sales growth in the quarter was primarily driven by value and the ongoing success of our Value Lunch program. Additional drivers included breakfast and greater convenience through initiatives such as delivering, dessert kiosks and extended hours. Our efforts are resonating with Chinese consumers. During a time when the informal eating-out market remains soft, we continue to increase our share of visits in our five major markets. As we invest in China, we intend to stay focused on gaining even greater relevance in the marketplace, from building drive-thrus, reimaging our restaurants and continuing to deliver a compelling menu of core and local offerings.  So those are a few highlights of our continued business momentum around the world. And as we begin this year, I want to reiterate our financial targets and capital management philosophy. We are confident that we will continue to deliver on our long-term average annual targets of 3% to 5% sales growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens. We believe these targets are right for a company of our size and maturity and keep us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.  Achieving these targets delivers significant cash flow and our philosophy for the use of this cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business. After that, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors. For 2010, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.  Let me just say that overall, I am proud to say that 2010 was another strong year. Our owner operators, suppliers, employees' strength and alignment have proven again to be a key competitive advantage. At a time of lingering economic uncertainty and slow growth, we continue to gain market share, attract more customers to our brand and fortify our financial strength. Our Plan to Win and its unrelenting focus on the customer has been a proven strategy in every kind of environment and it will continue to serve us well in 2011 and beyond.  Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Pete Bensen.\nPeter Bensen: Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full year performance demonstrates, our system's collective focus on the Plan to Win continues to deliver strong results despite challenging economic conditions. It's a battle for market share and McDonald's is clearly winning. Over the past year, we again exceeded our long-term financial targets. System-wide sales grew 6% in constant currencies. Operating income grew 10% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of impairment and other charges, and our one- and three-year returns on incremental invested capital, while not yet finalized, should be well above our high teens target. Exceeding these targets have positive implications for our investors who enjoyed an overall return on investment of nearly 27% in 2010, ranking us third among the Dow companies.  Positive comparable sales for the year in nearly all of our 117 markets, combined with expense control and favorable commodity cost, drove a 90 basis point improvement in combined operating margin. At 31%, our operating margin compares quite favorably to other large, global consumer companies.  Looking at restaurant margins, our consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 8% for the full year to $6.5 billion. The consolidated franchise margin percent rose 30 basis points to 82.4% for both the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by solid comparable sales growth in each area of the world. Consolidated Company-operated margins rose 20 basis points to 19% for the quarter as positive comparable sales more than offset higher labor and other costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 140 basis points to 19.6%, driven by comparable sales increases and lower commodity costs primarily in the U.S. and Europe.  Turning now to segment performance. In the U.S., we delivered comparable sales growth and even higher comparable guest count growth in both fourth quarter and the full year by staying focused on the customer. On a trailing 12-month basis through November, our IEO market share rose 50 basis points to 11.8%, the largest increase in five years, and our highest market share ever. This translated into over 550 million additional customer visits during this period. We drove this growth in a declining IEO market through a multifaceted approach that included relevant new product introductions like the frappes and smoothies, effective national promotions of iconic products like Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets; we expanded our value offerings to include Dollar Menu at breakfast and broadened our accessibility through extended hours and more dual-lane drive-thrus.  The increase in comparable sales generated significant top and bottom line gains at a restaurant level. On a beginning average annual store volume of nearly $2.4 million, it translated into over $90,000 of incremental sales in 2010. This was primarily accomplished through guest count increases, as we essentially took no price increases during the year. These strong sales helped drive our average owner operator cash flow per restaurant up nearly $50,000 or 16% to a record high $364,000 on a trailing 12-month basis through November.  U.S. Company-operated margins grew 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 190 basis points for the year. Positive comparable sales and relatively flat commodity costs in the fourth quarter and 4% lower commodity costs for the year more than offset higher labor costs. As we look to 2011, we project commodity cost increases of 2% to 2 1/2% in the U.S., which still puts our cost below 2009 levels. From a pricing standpoint, as commodity and other cost pressures become more pronounced as we move throughout the year, we will likely increase prices to offset some, but not necessarily all, of these cost increases. Growing traffic and market share has been a key to our success these last few years. Accordingly, we will continue to maintain the balance of strong traffic momentum with any strategic pricing moves.  Turning to Europe. In the fourth quarter, France and Germany continue to effectively promote the core menu, along with rotational fourth tier menu options. The U.K. also focused on menu variety and value, along with growing the Breakfast Daypart and Specialty Coffee business. We now have the leading market share of hot brewed coffee in the U.K. Increased sales partly offset by higher labor and slightly higher commodity costs contributed to Company-operated margins increasing 30 basis points for the quarter to 19.5%.  For the year, positive comparable sales along with a 2.5% decline in commodities, partly offset by higher labor costs, resulted in company operating margins increasing 140 basis points to 19.8%. As we head into 2011, we face some headwinds that could impact both sales and margins. VAT increases and austerity measures could potentially pressure overall retail sales growth, although to date, we have seen no change in customer behavior.  In the U.K., we already increased our prices to cover the 2.5% VAT increase implemented January 1. We did this strategically, restaurant by restaurant, not simply across the board. We will be closely monitoring the U.K. and the rest of Europe to understand consumer reactions to these measures. We also expect other austerity measures and tax increases to pressure Europe's margin. Increased social charges, especially in Russia, could negatively impact Europe's Company-operated margins by more than $20 million or about 30 basis points. In addition, we're projecting commodity cost increases of 3 1/2% to 4 1/2% in 2011.  Despite some of these near-term challenges, all of which are manageable, our business in Europe remains very strong, as does our fundamental operating model. We will continue to evaluate our pricing strategies and make adjustments when prudent while also balancing the need to grow guest counts. I'm confident that we have the right people and plans in place to continue to grow European sales, traffic and profitability in 2011 and beyond.  In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, virtually every country posted positive comparable sales for the quarter and the full year. Key convenience initiatives including delivery and drive-thru are increasing accessibility across all dayparts.  Convenience also means being open beyond the traditional workday. Nearly 2/3 of our restaurants in APMEA offer some form of extended hours, and over half are open 24 hours. In addition, breakfast continues to be a growth platform and is offered in about 75% of our 8,400 restaurants. Relative to profitability, APMEA's Company-operated margin was flat for the quarter at 17.1% as positive comparable sales were offset by increased labor, occupancy and restaurant opening costs. For the year, Company-operated margins increased 100 basis points to 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, APMEA enjoyed lower commodity costs along with strong comparable sales, which more than offset higher labor and other costs. For a perspective, APMEA's year-end McOpCo margin is 690 basis points higher than five years ago. We are pleased with our progress in this key growth region and remain optimistic about our long-term potential.  The final component of combined operating margin is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased for the quarter and the year in line with our expectations. Remember that the year included costs associated with the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our Biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. Importantly, G&A declined both as a percent of sales and revenue for the fifth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue in 2011.  I'd like to comment briefly on our tax rate, which we expect to be slightly higher in 2011. In the past couple of years, our effective tax rate benefited by approximately two percentage points from our ability to claim certain foreign tax credits. With a recent change in tax law, these credits are no longer available to us. Our economic engine, coupled with prudent financial management, continues to generate significant amounts of cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business to continue growing and generating strong returns.  In 2011, we expect to invest about $2.5 billion, half of which will be used to open approximately 1,100 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segments is as follows: 150 openings in the U.S., 225 in Europe and 625 in APMEA, including 175 to 200 new openings in China. The other half of our CapEx will be devoted to investing in our existing locations.  The U.S. completed about 200 reimages in 2010. With our knowledge and experience growing, we expect to complete an additional 600 this year. Europe is planning to complete over 850 reimages while APMEA is projecting about 500. We manage our business for the long term. Reimaging is critical because it significantly enhances customer perceptions of our brand and helps drive sales over time. To remain relevant, I believe the decision to reimage is not a question of, if but rather of when. Our system is strong, our owner operators have both the financial capacity and willingness to reinvest, and we are taking share from the competition, all of which combine to make it an ideal time for McDonald's to seize this opportunity.  Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.02 while benefiting full year EPS by $0.01. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2011 EPS to be positively impacted by about $0.01 with a greater benefit for the full year. As always, take this as directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011.  As we enter the new year, the environment continues to change, posing both new opportunities and challenges. Our performance over the last couple of years gives a great confidence in the ability of the McDonald's system, our owner operators, suppliers and company employees, to successfully navigate these conditions. We are operating from a position of strength, our system is aligned with over 32,000 restaurants serving more than 62 million customers a day with high-quality food at a great value at the speed and convenience only McDonald's can offer. We are poised for future growth and well positioned to participate fully as the economy begins to recover.2011 will be another great year for the McDonald's system. Thank you.  Now I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A.\nCathy Martin: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Kelter from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I wanted to ask you first and foremost about food inflation. You gave some initial guidance for the year. What assumptions did you bake into that guidance as it relates to costs around the world? What did you already lock in versus what's floating? And more broadly, what did you learn in, lets say, '07, '08, in the last inflationary commodity environment that maybe you'll do some things a little different at this time around.\nJim Skinner: Mike, this Jim Skinner. First of all, we learn a lot every year about how to manage our way through these commodity cost increases. But we've been doing it a long time, not just 2007 and 2008 and certainly '09 and now coming '10, and now going into 2011. It's really been business as usual in the way we approach this relative to the supply chain and the treasury working together on some of the hedging and the out contracts relative to those things that impact the commodity cost, as you know, to lock in prices so that we have a reasonable expectation in the P&L for our franchisees. But with that, I'll let Pete talk specifically to what that process looked like or what our assumptions were.\nPeter Bensen: Mike, as Jim mentioned our goal there really in our commodity hedging with our suppliers is to provide predictability and stability in the pricing. So we look at our basket of goods as a -- if we look region by region, the U.S., we have more opportunity to lock in cost because of broader markets and more instruments available to our suppliers to do that hedging. And so we're not going to give specific percentages by each category. We're about as locked-in today as we were a year ago at this time and have a fair degree of confidence in that 2% to 2.5% increase. Probably the biggest variable in that will be beef. We built a substantial increase in our beef cost into that guidance but that's the one market that looks like it could be the most volatile for us. The same with Europe, beef is probably the biggest driver of our volatility there. Where, typically, less opportunity to lock in and hedge broadly across the continent, although each year, both in Europe and APMEA, we get more and more opportunity to get that done. So the U.S., at 2% or 2.5%, we feel pretty good about that in terms of our ability to raise prices where it makes sense to deal with that. But as we look at price as we've experienced these last couple of years, growing traffic is very important. So as I said in my remarks, we're going to look to balance traffic growth with recovering input costs and the same basically in the other two areas.\nCathy Martin: Our next question is from David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank: I just want to follow up on that a little bit. With regard to how you think about pricing -- and I've asked this on previous quarters but it's kind of relevant going forward. As you talked about you basket prices being up three-ish depending on the continent, they're going to be up a few percent on a grocery basket. You're seeing CPI these days a little less than 2% for restaurants and at home. So that's creeping up. You still haven't taken pricing yet. How will you think about your pricing? Is it still the outside world and doing a little bit below that? So if you see 2% in the outside world, you're thinking 1%, and as that creeps up, you're shadowing that, or is it your own input cost?\nJim Skinner: David, Jim Skinner, and I'm going to have Don Thompson talk about the specific segments, if he will. I wish it were that scientific but we measure everything. And as you know, we have a very comprehensive pricing tool that we use in every segment and we're pretty good at taking a look at all of those factors that are going to have an impact. But the most important factor is really, what about the elasticity that we have for pricing relative to the value orientation for our customers, which is the most important thing. And when we factor all of those things together, including inflation, we do have the opportunity to pass some of those costs along in price increases. But as Pete said in his comments, not all of those in every market. And so with that, I'll let Don talk a little bit about the segments.\nDonald Thompson: David, to Jim's point and Pete's point, one of the things that we look at quite intently is the consumer base side of this. So food away from home is a huge component, which is related to CPI. But we look a little deeper than the CPI piece alone, so we'll look at the producer price index as a result of that. And then we look at food at home. And so one of the things we found in the U.S. quite a few years ago was that pricing to food away from home and below food away from home maintained a good value rating for us and to the point again made, a good sensitivity from consumers in terms of their ongoing purchase intent. So that was a big point. The other thing though that we learned was that food at home does matter, so grocery store prices do matter. If you look at the U.S. this last year, you saw about a 1.3 in terms of food away from home. But interestingly enough, you only saw 2/10 increase in food at home. So our pricing, we have to be able to flex around those points and make sure we have solid value. It is not based upon our competitors' pricing alone. Matter of fact, that's a very small portion of our consideration but we do look at the others. When you look around the rest of the world, it varies to Pete's point by market. You got markets that have higher inflation, such as sometimes markets like Russia. You've got other markets that have very low inflation, such as markets like the UK. And so even as we look at all of our pricing strategies, we have to take into account market-by-market those individual circumstances. And so we look at food away from home, food at home, and then we try to make sure that we continue to remain our value proposition, which to Pete's point is really around price stability especially around the value menus.\nCathy Martin: Our next question comes from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just a quick question for Pete following up on all the pricing and cost discussion. Pete, given what you know about the level of pricing you might take and the level of cost inflation you might see in the various markets, what type of comps do you think you'll need to hold on to your company restaurant margin in 2011? Maybe if you could talk about both the U.S. and Europe, that would be helpful.\nPeter Bensen: David, traditionally as we've looked at our model, we've said that in the U.S., a 2% to 3% comp in a normal year is what we need to maintain margins. So from an input side, cost input side this year, this looks like a normal year for the U.S. Europe, our cost structure is a little higher and, yes, typically, we need a three-plus to maintain margins there. And a couple things: One, commodity costs are going to be a little bit higher than average this year in Europe and that increase in the social taxes in Russia is that 30 basis-point drag on the segment's margin is adding some additional challenge. They have a social charge on wages there that's going from 26% to 34% of wages and about 20% of our McOpCo sales come out of Russia. So that's more of an unusual, one-time item that's impacting Europe but it is a consideration when we look at the margins there for the year.\nCathy Martin: And next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Oppenheimer.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Just to clarify on that or follow up quickly before I get in my question, that 30 basis points on the segment, was that already visible in this quarter and in the other occupancy leverage or deleverage when I look at the overall margins? Or are we expecting that to come? Then I wonder if you can give us any sort of greater clarity on what you see as same-store sales drivers, especially in the U.S. as you lapped the beverage introduction and launches, things that we could look for. Are we correct to presume that incrementally, from beverages, there's not going to be as much on the calendar this year and we're done with that and we're going to be moreso lapping in introduction rather than bringing out some new things alongside the beverage lineup?\nPeter Bensen: Matt, it's Pete. I'll clarify, that increase in taxes in Russia is effective January 1, so we did not experience any of that in December. And I'll let Don talk about the opportunity that we still have ahead of us in beverage.\nDonald Thompson: Matt, to the point we have some big benefits still available, we think, in beverages. Keeping this in mind, remember it was only a few years ago beverages represented 2% a sale -- or I should say, coffee. And the whole coffee base represented about 2% a sale in the U.S. To date, it's over 6%, and we still have some opportunities there. In 2011, you're still going to see some benefit from frappes and smoothies. You're going to see benefit I think continuing relative to the way the market and calendars are structured, to continue to, on an on-going fashion, talk about our McCaf\u00e9 line up. So we're not running away from those. We want to make sure we continue to market those effectively. But I wouldn't be as shortsighted as looking only at the beverage side. We continue to have great consumer reaction to our core products. So this past year, Big Macs and the nuggets, that Pete talked about and Jim talked about, the breakfast value keeping in mind that last year or 2010 was the first year we implemented breakfast value at a national level. All the markets had, had something before, but with a concerted voice. So we continue to have that as it moves forward. We hope to see some economic benefit as recovery, but we don't count too much on that as of this point. But you've got a great core and we've got the value that we'll continue to talk about. You still got beverages. The U.S. will begin, in a more aggressive way, their reimaging programs this year, which always gives a lifts to the brand as we move that forward as well. Extended hours, the U.S. grew another couple of points last year so they still got some opportunity. It's in the high-30s versus being in the 50s when you look at 24/7 over in APMEA, so still room there. More room to grow in terms of drive-thrus as we look at drive-thru optimization. And the third phase of that was side-by-side and dual lanes and all the investments that we and the franchisees continue to make. So those are some of the things and that's without talking about the rest of the pipeline, which right now we have many of the markets around the world tapping into the global pipelines that we've established, everything from wraps to wings to Angus burgers and Angus snack wraps. So we feel pretty good about the menu pipeline and about our ability to continue to drive the business.\nCathy Martin: And next question comes from Jeff Omohundro from Wells Fargo.\nJeffrey Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on the opportunity that you see in the U.S. for it in reimaging that Don just mentioned, both in terms of the focus areas in the program and also perhaps comparing it with the European effort in areas such as cost and the expected returns.\nDonald Thompson: I'll chat a little bit about this, and if Pete or Jim want to chime in, they definitely can on this one. Relative to reimaging, what we think will happen in the U.S. is very similar to what we've seen. I'm glad you brought up some of the markets in Europe. I'll pick a couple of them we've talked about before. France and Australia, if you look at Australia, it's been now about seven years since they actually began some of their reimaging. The market is now complete. We've continued to see great business movement in Australia and we continue to see great guest count movement really driving that. So demand is driving it. As we move into, if you look at France and look at the different decors, what we try to do in markets outside of France and Australia is learn from what they did. So in the U.S., one of the things that we held back on in 2010 was to get the design portfolio right so consumers would react to that portfolio in a positive way. And as a result of that, we've begun to do interiors and exteriors at the same time in the U.S. And so we think that we're going to see some really good benefit to both the designs themselves. The designs in Manhattan will be a little bit different than the designs in Kearney, Missouri but the exteriors of the building will fit the neighborhoods and the consumers that we see there. So we're pretty positive relative to reimaging. Incrementally, we are still seeing that 6% to 7% in terms of incremental sales, the returns are strong, but keeping in mind the returns are based not only on the investment and the cost there but also on a broader base of where sales go in those marketplaces. So we have seen when we get to a certain point, 30, 40 percentile in the markets that we see an additional brand lift in those marketplaces as well.\nJim Skinner: And just to comment also that maybe had been overlooked, is we've improved our customer satisfaction scores throughout 2010 in most every segment, including the United States. And so these reimagings along with the new POS and those other tools that the management crew have for delivering a greater experience for the customer and drive-thru optimization that Don talked about, gives us a lift. Not only in reimaged stores but in stores that are enhancing drive-thru experience at the front counter. And we got to be sure we don't forget about operating excellence as a driver of sales growth.\nCathy Martin: Next question is Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndrew Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Can you clarify a little bit? You cite higher labor costs in the U.S. and Europe in particular in fourth quarter margins, yet payroll and benefits were down. Is that something else going on there or is it bonus expense? Can you just clarify a little bit on the labor line?\nPeter Bensen: Andy, it's just that some of that labor is a fixed cost. So as we drive comps as a percentage of sales, it goes down as a percent. But our hourly wages and some of the variable costs in there were increasing.\nCathy Martin: Next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: What is your internal level of tolerance for letting, say McOpCo margins on a consolidated basis slip below flat? In other words, are you willing to let it go down to preserve traffic or do you have a baseline that says we'll utilize pricing to a level least maintained flat margins, beyond that, obviously, it's going to be driven by traffic. If you can answer that, and also, is there a sequencing of how commodity inflation impacts 2011? Is it worse in the first half or second half or is it pretty even?\nPeter Bensen: John, we have no internal tolerance, to use your word, for McOpCo margin. As we talked this morning, we don't manage solely by McOpCo margin. And you heard a lot from Don and Jim about our pricing philosophy. Now the flip side to that, worldwide, we're 80% franchised. And so obviously, it is important that the franchisees' profitability, so it's not like our store-operating margin is irrelevant but it's in the mix, it's in that art that Jim talked about in our pricing decisions. And it's something we look at, but we have no internal guidelines, if you will, that if it is looking like it's going a certain direction, that we suddenly jump on price.\nJim Skinner: I think we also, as we have over the last three years, John, as you know, continue to look at combined operating margin which has increased every year. And so that's the mix really when you're taking a look at the margin expectation, but just as a headline. And Pete answered it properly, we have no tolerance for decreasing margins overall. But we don't manage our business to that.\nPeter Bensen: And as we move throughout the year, John, you asked a question about progression. In the U.S., the second and third quarters will be the highest in terms of the increase. Europe seems pretty stable in terms of that increase throughout the four quarters.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Pete, just one clarification and then a separate question. On the clarification side you mentioned in Europe, I think you mentioned you've already taken enough pricing in the U.K. to offset the 2 1/2% VAT increase. And the last quarter you had mentioned that you're expecting some margin pressures beyond that just due to the normal course of inflation. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the thoughts around when to take price there. Like how you measure what potential negative impact there is from austerity before you consider price or whether we should still expect a near-term hit to margin. And then just separately on China, I know your prepared remarks talked about the informal eating-out market remains soft. Just wondering whether you could touch on whether you view that as still -- at what point do you take that from a short-term concern to maybe a longer-term concern? And perhaps how the cost pressures play out there. It seems like labor and food inflation are a pretty big issue there. We don't get as much color there as we do in the U.S. and Europe.\nPeter Bensen: All right, Jeff, I'll talk about the U.K. a little bit and ask Don or Jim to talk about China. With the VAT increase, I think as you know, VAT is netted in our sales number there. So we took the 2 1/2% increase, which basically is neutral to comps because the underlying tax increased 2 1/2%. So we needed that just to stay even. And consumers in the U.K. have been conditioned, we took prices down when VAT went down a couple of years ago and we raise them when they go up. That happens across all the retail, so we're on the same footing as everyone else. And then now that we're on the same footing and we've recovered the VAT, we're going to look at the price increases to our backdoor in the U.K., just like we do all around the world. We're going to try to balance, continuing to provide great value, we'll look at it store by store and we won't be looking at any one particular measure to determine when and how much to raise prices.\nJim Skinner: And Jeff, regarding China, this is Jim, we only point out the softening IEO because it's a fact and something that you would expect us to comment on. But it does not concern us in the short-term or the long-term. Nor does it necessarily dictate our strategy in China. Our strategy's been strong. We're opening more and more restaurants, we're opening more and more drive-thrus, we're meeting the consumers' needs on menu. And certainly, we price in that marketplace just like we do everyplace else based on the movement up and down the scale relative to the economy and in the informal eating-out and in the quick service sector. And so it's in there because it's softened some but when you look at the population and the penetration in the marketplace, it's not a significant factor in our strategies.\nDonald Thompson: Jeff, to Jim's point, our strategies remain sound. A few things we do see, one is in the south, we saw some pretty good recovery in 2010. You all know that in 2009, the south was a point of concern just relative to where the economy was going. South recovered pretty well. North and Central we still see a little bit of softness there. I think the thing that we continue to watch is what we've talked about already when we look at food at home across China, that's where we're seeing the greatest escalation. It was over 10% in terms of basically their version of the producer price index, and so we continue to look at that, but it really helps us relative to our execution strategy, which is around our value programs, our Value Lunch programs. We continue to build breakfast in China. Our breakfast percentage increase is now roughly seven percentile and still a lot of room to grow based on the Asians' and the Chinese habit relative to breakfast. So we feel pretty strong about the actual plan that we have along with the development plan as we continue to grow the marketplace.\nCathy Martin: Next question is Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.\nMitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Can you comment on this quarter, I believe the franchising mix globally went down about 20 bps or so. That's the first time we've seen that in quite a few years. And as you go forward, do you expect the franchising mix to continue its long-term trend of going up? And I apologize if I can just slip one other question in there, on the other operating income line, Pete, can you just refresh us as to how you look at that line in 2011 given less refranchising activity and the potential for more asset write-offs from the reimaging campaign?\nJim Skinner: Mitch, Jim Skinner. I'll start with the franchising. We made a commitment a few years ago to transition 1,500 restaurants into the hands of franchisees. We're about 1,400 now. We're pretty much through with that and there hasn't been any significant shift relative to the overall franchising as a percentage. And there's no intention to move off of that strategy. We will look at our ownership structure in various markets around the world where we have the opportunity to continue to put the restaurants in the hands of more franchisees. But that number will be pretty much where it is today, I think over the long term.\nPeter Bensen: Yes. I think that the one blip that you may have seen there, we purchased about 40 restaurants in Canada at the end of the year. But that was just part of our plans to kind of look at that market and redistribute necessarily where the McOpCos are at. So looking at the other operating income line, Mitch, I think you have it right in terms of thinking that the income from that line in 2011 will likely be lower than it is in 2010 primarily for a couple of reasons. We will probably have fewer gains on store sales and as we do more reimaging, we tend to have more asset write-offs associated with the restaurants that we touch. But it will be down from the approximate $200 million of income that we recorded this year.\nCathy Martin: The next question is Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: I just wanted to ask a question about the SG&A guidance, obviously down or for decline in constant currencies of 2% to 3%, it's a little different than what I was expecting. I know you quantified the two major events from last year or discuss them. Could you talk a little bit more about like how much they mean to this and maybe what other pieces are playing into the G&A guidance?\nPeter Bensen: You know, Keith, the two events that are mentioned on an as-reported basis account for essentially all of the decline next year. So what that means is our underlying G&A continues to be flat. So we work really hard as an organization to continually re-allocate our G&A. And what we mean by that is looking at getting resources closer to the customer that were going to impact decisions at the restaurant and minimizing back-of-the-house, administrative-type costs. And that's just a part of our culture. It's an ongoing focus. It's allowing our ongoing normal recurring G&A to be relatively flat, is pretty good.\nCathy Martin: Next question is Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch: First, a follow-up on China, the last couple of quarters you've actually shared the same-store sales numbers in China. Would you be willing to do that again?\nPeter Bensen: Sure, Joe. The comp for China for the fourth quarter was 5.2% and the guest comp growth was a little more than 6%.\nCathy Martin: Next question, Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies: Just back on pricing, could you please walk us through how much price you had in each of the three segments you disclosed for the fourth quarter? And how that compares with what you have entering the first quarter? And historically, have all the price increases you've taken, did they traditionally -- are they pass-through or is there any resistance?\nPeter Bensen: Nicole, I'll quantify what we estimate our pricing increases were for the full year in 2010 and I'll let Don talk a little bit about the relationship between the change in the menu board price and what flows through in the P&L. But as I said in my remarks, the U.S. was essentially flat. So we basically took zero. Europe was closer to 3%, with markets like Russia being a little bit higher, and Germany, the U.K. being a little bit lower than that. And APMEA was about 1%, which was pretty average amongst the major markets there. So that's what we experienced in 2010 but I'll let Don talk a little bit about flow-through and customer resistance.\nDonald Thompson: Nicole, typically it depends on the area we're in little bit. But typically when there's a menu price increase, you'll get about a 50% or 60% flow-through. Now that again depends upon the pricing structure in the area of the world. Relative to resistance, we try really hard, as I mentioned earlier, to make sure that we're priced below in terms of these increases, food away from home, and then we're mindful of food at home. What happens is if you get outside of those kind of guidelines, we have seen that you can have some resistance. But if you look at our guest count growth, we have been able to manage this exceptionally well. If you look at the U.S. last year, they were very mindful of the price increase so they didn't take much at all. As a result, we had the highest guest count growth that we've seen historically on an annual basis for comp in recent history. So when you look at Europe, Europe managed it very, very well. They were able to take a little more price increase as a result of what's happened in areas like Russia, as Pete mentioned earlier. But nonetheless, great guest count growth. This was a really strong year for us in terms of guest count growth. You just heard the numbers on China. And knowing what the economy is in China, to see the results that we've seen there relative to guest count increases really bodes well especially as we move into the future. So those two points, food away from home, mindful of food at home, mindful of the competitive set all help us in terms of our pricing strategies.\nPeter Bensen: And Nicole, this tool we use, one more point on the resistance. We take a historical look at restaurant by restaurant, what price increases we've taken and what's happened to guest count movement, et cetera. So through that, we're actually able to isolate which products tend to have the lower amount of resistance to price increases. And typically, we'll focus on them as well.\nCathy Martin: Our next question is from Steven West from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMatthew Van Vliet: Actually, Matt Van Vliet on for Steve today. I just had a follow-up question to the comments about Chinese inflation and kind of the geographic recovery there. Has that changed your growth outlook or the strategy, whether be it short-term, opening new units in the south more than maybe the North and Central as you said, or any kind of long-term shifts taking inflation into account and what kind of returns you can get from certain units and whether those kind of hurdle rates are high enough, given the labor and some of the other inflation that we've seen?\nDonald Thompson: Matt, no, it has not changed our strategy. Our strategy has been around the core cities initially and then growing out from the core cities. Matter fact, to see the recovery in the south is very, very positive for us. We've got -- a lot of our initial sites have been in that southern area. So we feel really strong there. We feel good about our growth strategies in terms of our -- many of you may have been over in China earlier this year and heard Kenneth [Chan] talk a little bit about our strategy, which is a ring strategy of focusing on the core cities. Then one of the things we have done is as we move out to the outer ring, we're focused on drive-thru development more so now. We know that the drive-thrus give us additional sales and returns even though it's a slightly higher cost structure because of the amount of land required to put a drive-thru in, we get stronger returns there. So our strategy has not changed, focus on the core, move out from the core, incorporate drive-thrus. And also at the same time be able to have full menu across the market. So it still remains the same.\nCathy Martin: Next is Greg Badishkanian from Citi.\nGregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Could you just provide a little bit of color on the competitive landscape in the U.S. breakfast market and would you expect to gain or maybe pick up some share here in 2011 with initiatives like oatmeal and others?\nJim Skinner: Greg, this is Jim Skinner. Let me just comment on that because oatmeal is near and dear to my heart, I eat a lot of it. But I would have to say that, if you look at McDonald's history, we grow the breakfast daypart every year and we have really since the inception of breakfast 30-some years ago. And the Dollar Menu last year helped us with that certainly in terms of guest count growth around breakfast time frame. And really gave us a boost on value across the menu. But the expectation would be, again, in 2011, that breakfast would continue to grow as a daypart.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: It is certainly impressive that you grew share and grew your business in a declining informal eating-out market in 2010. But everything that you're seeing right now such as employment in the U.S., which is now turning positive, and maybe some kind of gives and takes in Europe, some economies doing some very well while other economies entering austerity. Could you give us kind of your broad, macro outlook of those two markets, informal eating-out in U.S. and Europe? I mean, do you think we have another down, stable or perhaps even increasing environment for 2011?\nJim Skinner: Well, not much has changed going into 2011 from the way we looked at it last year, John. And so if you look at the economy, we pay close attention to the consumer confidence in the United States. That has ticked down from November again. You know the unemployment levels as well as I do. So when you look at the job markets, I don't see a lot changing there in the near term. There has been some slight growth and a little bit of change in the economy over the last six months. But when we go into 2011, I think we're sort of seeing this the same way. Whether or not we expect the informal eating-out market to grow is, maybe slightly in 2011. But quite frankly, we don't see a substantial change there. When you look at Europe, Europe continues to have fits and starts but, as Pete mentioned in his comments, we're really not seeing an impact from some of these austerity measures yet. And as I've said many times before, our business model operates fairly well in these environments and Europe's had fits and starts before, and we've managed through those over the years and we don't expect to see substantial impact from that relative to certainly the overall growth of McDonald's share against the informal eating-out. And the overall economies around the world though, I should say, are sort of where they were coming out of 2010 going into 2011. And don't see a whole lot of change there. But I do believe that GDP will be better in 2011 in the U.S. And I think countries in Europe remain to be seen. But we always have to remember that when we look at Europe, it's 50 countries all operating at different levels of economic performance. And so we've managed through that one country at a time. Yes, the big three: U.K., Germany and France are big drivers of our business there and we certainly manage very well through those ups and downs in those countries as well.\nCathy Martin: Next question, Larry Miller, RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I just wanted to clarify something. When you guys, and you don't do this very often, when you were quantifying the weather and you said that Europe was about 5% negative impact, that would mean that you think the run rate was something like 4 1/2%. Is that consistent then with what you're seeing as the weather's gotten better in January then?\nJim Skinner: Yes. That's why we said there are some people who said, \"Well, we mentioned weather, but was it really a concern over austerity and the issues in Europe?\" And the answer to that is no. We feel like there was at least a 5% impact on sales in Europe and more than 2% here in the United States. Airports were closed in Europe. You'll all remember people skiing on the steps of the administration buildings in France, people trapped in London, Berlin airports. So we have a tendency to forget that. Even here when there's no traffic, it's a little difficult for us to operate.\nCathy Martin: We have another question, Howard Penney from Hedgeye.\nHoward Penney - Prudential Equity Group: You constantly cite compelling value as one of the traffic drivers which I think led to a decline in your average check this year, which I guess you could argue was the real driver behind traffic. So I mean I know you've talked about why you're going to raise prices. But given those dynamics, how do you feel or why do you feel you can raise prices? And then you also gave us statistics for McCaf\u00e9 of up 20%. Does that include both hot and cold product movement? And if it does, is there any chance you could break out the hot versus cold?\nCompany Speaker: Don, did we have a problem with average check this year?\nDonald Thompson: No. Howard, a couple of things on average check. One to your point, if you implement a value menu of sorts, there are times when we will see some slight erosion relative to the average check. We picked that up in terms of the total transactions and overall profitability is also higher. Having said that, there's more than the value components of average check. We also have implemented the beverage strategy. As a result, our items per transaction on a beverage purchase will be lower than items per transaction when you're buying an overall meal that includes sandwich, fries or side, and then the drink. And so what we do see is because of those individual purchases, and also because of the benefit we get with those purchases later in the day, snack periods, et cetera, we have seen that the average check component that we've seen. Our average check is very, very healthy. The new products have performed very, very well, so we're good there. When you ask a question about McCaf\u00e9 relative to the hot and the cold, we have seen good growth across beverages based upon the numbers we came out initially with McCaf\u00e9. And we talked about $125,000 based upon all of the McCaf\u00e9 beverages, frappes and the smoothies, those numbers that we gave earlier, we've exceeded the expectations that we have for the numbers. And so we're solid both on the hot end and on the cold end relative to beverages.\nCathy Martin: We're going to take one final question and it is Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank AG: You talked about pricing in the U.S. I'm assuming that's just for company stores. If you have any sense if your franchisees are starting to take some price already and maybe what else you're seeing from competitors on that front as well would be helpful.\nDonald Thompson: Jason, franchisees as you know, are free to choose their pricing strategies. We do offer support relative to an outside, a third-party service that gives guidance and strategic thoughts around pricing. So the franchisees avail themselves of that service. And they pay for a portion of that service themselves. But relative to how that impacts the overall business and how that impacts our overall pricing strategy, we feel like, and the franchisees feel like, they've been in pretty good shape relative to the price increases. They don't pick their prices solely based upon our Company-operated restaurants. They look at individual restaurants, as Pete mentioned earlier, and individual marketplaces and that is the case around the world relative to franchisee pricing. So have they taken any? Some of them have taken some price increase and that's just an ongoing approach, ongoing way of doing business that they look at their prices.\nCathy Martin: I'm going to turn it over to Jim who's got a few closing remarks.\nJim Skinner: Well, thanks, everybody for joining us. In closing, I want to reiterate the ongoing strength of our global business and the optimism we have in the continued success of the McDonald's brand. Our Plan to Win remains a strong and relevant strategy and one that continues to resonate with our customers around the world. With our entire system aligned and focused, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver for our more than our 62 million customers a day. Thanks, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-10-26 05:18:39", "content": "Executives: Jim Skinner - Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee Peter Bensen - Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Executive Vice President Donald Thompson - President and Chief Operating Officer Mary Kay Shaw - Vice President of Investor Relations\nAnalysts: Joshua Long - Stephens Inc Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group\nOperator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's October 21, 2010 Investor Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Kay Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Shaw, you may begin.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner; Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen; and for Q&A, Chief Operating Officer, Don Thompson will be joining us via phone from Mexico where we are celebrating our 25th anniversary. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Those documents are available on investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJim Skinner: Thank you, Mary Kay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest business results that reflect our continued global strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 6%. Operating income increased 11% on constant currencies and earnings per share reached $1.29, a 15% increase in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to increase 5% to 6%. Our strength remains broad-based with each area of the world contributing to our growth. And we're continuing to grow market share in our major markets. In an informal eating-out category that varies from markets that are in decline to markets that are just growing slightly. These results marked our 30th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases and this is truly a testament to our ability to perform in any economy. We continue to deliver what our customers are looking for: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant menu offerings, with an emphasis on local taste. And it's all resonating with our customers. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 5.3% and operating income grew 7%. And most important, we continue to significantly increase traffic into our restaurants. On the big menu news, this summer was the extension of our Beverage platform with the launch of strawberry, banana and wild berry smoothies and the rehit of frappes. Sales from the smoothies launch well exceeded our expectations in both products are being purchased throughout the day. Both of these high-margin beverages continue to sell at a strong pace. U.S. also drove quarterly results with value across the menu including the continuation of our Breakfast Dollar Menu. And on the convenience front, we're continuing to be available for more guests more often with nearly 40% of our U.S. restaurants now open 24 hours and more than 80% open by 5:00 a.m. in the morning. In August, we launched the Angus Snack Wrap line with three choices at $1.99. This new introduction performed very well and has lifted sales of our entire Angus Burger category. Our new beverage and snack wrap platforms contributed to the trailing 12-month period ending in August and delivered the highest guests counts in more than 20 years in the U.S., even as the overall industry continued to be stagnant. We're innovating and we're executing and it's giving more people more reasons to choose McDonald's. Our customers continue to give us permission to stretch our brand, and we're delivering at the quality, value and speed of McDonald's. This month, we're featuring our core products of McCaf\u00e9 beverages through a monopoly tie-in with Walmart gift cards. And in November, we will advertise the always popular McRib on a national basis for a limited time, something we've not done for years. Early next year, we will be launching oatmeal with maple brown sugar, apples, raisins and cranberries available all day. And in market test, our customers love the taste, nutrition profile and the expanded menu choice. Now turning to Europe, we had another strong quarter. Comparable sales increased 4.1% and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. Now while the overall informal eating-out category in Europe remained in decline, we continued to take share in all of our major markets. The key driver of growth across Europe continues to be our focus on modernizing and elevating the customer experience. More than 2/3 of our restaurant interiors in Europe are now reimaged and provide an ever-more contemporary and relevant environment for our guests and the people working in our restaurants. Meanwhile, our customer satisfaction scores improved across the continent as we work to continually enhance our service with the biggest gains coming from drive-thru times and order accuracy. Across Europe, we're striking the right blend of variety and choice, broadening our accessibility and appealing to a wide array of consumer segments. In Germany, for example, sales benefited from the launch of McWrap, a premium range of chicken and beef wrap sandwiches and, of course, everyday affordable pricing across the menu. Germany and many other markets feature a Coca-Cola glass promotion with the purchase of an Extra Value Meal driving some of our highest Extra Value Meal sales in history. We also saw success with the reintroduction of menu favorites, the M sandwich in the U.K., a premium burger with Artisan bread and the popular Double Cheeseburger in France. The Beverage platform, while different than the U.S., also contributed to results. We've recently launched Frappes, Europe's enhanced milkshakes, in several markets including France and Switzerland where it is contributing to the growth of the snacking daypart. And we are now the largest seller of coffee in the U.K., as premium bean-to-cup and specialty coffees continue to attract the growing number of consumers especially when a great McDonald's breakfast is available to go along with it. Looking ahead, we know the economic environment remains challenging with austerity measures continuing to be implemented. In January, the VAT will increase in the U.K., Holland and Portugal and others could follow. Yet we remain confident that our business model will endure. We expect our customer focus, menu pipeline and the ongoing modernization of our restaurants will continue to deliver long-term results. Now looking to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where we also achieved strong growth, comparable sales for the quarter increased 8.1% and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. Results were strong across the segment with nearly half the markets delivering double-digit comparable sales increases. We're driving results through a focus on convenience, value and a balance of core and local offerings. Australia made gains with new menu items including a promotional addition to its extremely popular Angus platform. The new sandwich, Angus the Third featured the popular tomato chili relish and scored extremely well with our consumers. The market also rolled out a new patty for all premium chicken sandwiches driving an increase in sales across the entire premium chicken category. The addition of the new Breakfast Roll and Breakfast Wrap helped grow comp sales and guests counts during the breakfast daypart. And Australia continued to focus on running better restaurants as it achieved some of its best service scores on record with improvements in drive-thru speed and accuracy leading the way. Our other major markets in APMEA, China and Japan also delivered. Value continues to be a key driver. China's Value Lunch program remains popular and continues to grow sales and traffic. The Value Lunch is now moved into nearly every market in greater Asia and accounts for more than 10% of the total sales in the region. Outstanding operations continue to drive growth and differentiate the experience in China with the market consistently achieving some of our best customer satisfaction scores. Our strategies in China are resonating with the consumers and our fundamentals are strong as evidenced by China's third quarter 12.7% comparable sales increase. Meanwhile in Japan we remain competitive through relevant menu offerings and promotions. We delivered gains from a strong Big Mac campaign and a new lemon chicken sandwich, both of which proved extremely popular. Japanese consumers also reacted favorably to our recent Food Strap promotion which offered miniature models of our iconic products such as Big Mac and fries for customers to actually strap to their cell phones. The program was a huge hit and helped drive sales profits and new guests visits as we combined the popular local trend with the popularity of our iconic products. Japan's other big win was the launch of its value breakfast featuring McDonald's Sausage McMuffin and Sausage McGriddle helping drive sales and revitalize our Breakfast business. So those are a few of the highlights around our continued momentum. We're delivering the food and beverages our customers want and the value that they expect and an overall dining and brand experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers' lives. We're also continuing our commitment to financial discipline. We have a strong balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry allowing continued access to capital. And it continues to facilitate access to credit for our owner/operators to reinvest in their restaurants. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.61 per share or the equivalent of $2.44 annually. Combined with share repurchases, we expected our total cash return to shareholders for 2010 to reach an approximation of $5 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance and confident that we'll continue to keep driving our business forward. Now while it's been said by economists that the recession has technically ended and signs of progress are slowly emerging, the global economy remains fragile and consumers continue to be cautious. By continuing to innovate, invest and deliver what our customers want, we will continue to gain market share and grow our business. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO.\nPeter Bensen: Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Third quarter marked yet another strong performance for the McDonald's system. Our alignment behind the Plan to Win again generated significant increases across all of our key measures: comparable sales and guests counts, market share, operating income and returns. Combined operating margin, our primary measure of overall profitability increased 150 basis points to 31.4% for the nine months. This is a direct result of growth in both our consolidated franchise margins and our company-operated margins along with effective G&A control. In the U.S., the successful introduction of McCafe Smoothies in July and the ongoing demand for our core menu drove gains in both comparable sales and guest counts. While our pricing remains relatively flat versus a year ago, we are especially encouraged that our traffic growth was about 1.5x that of our comparable sales growth through September. Lower food and paper costs along with top line growth contributed to an increase in company-operated margins of 270 basis points to 22% in the third quarter. Equally important, our U.S. franchisees are generating significant increases in their annual cash flow per restaurant, now averaging over $350,000, a 15% increase over a year ago. This speaks to the health of our overall business and contributes significantly to our operators' willingness and ability to reinvest in their restaurants. On the cost side, our third quarter basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 6%, contributing around 200 basis points to the margin expansion, similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year. However, the comparisons become unfavorable in the fourth quarter as we face a 1% to 2% increase in commodity cost compared with fourth quarter 2009. This still results in our overall food and paper costs being down 3% to 4% for the full year. In Europe, the grocery bill declined to a more modest 1% in the third quarter. We now project commodity cost will be down 2% to 3% for the full year. This means that Europe will experience a slight increase in commodity cost in the fourth quarter compared with a decline of 3% in fourth quarter last year. European company-operated margins increased 160 basis points in the third quarter to 22%. Comparable sales gains in Russia, the U.K., Spain and many other markets coupled with lower commodity costs were partly offset by higher labor costs. Menu prices increased an average of 2% to 3% across the segment over the past 12 months, but varied by market. As we head into the fourth quarter, some of these price increases will roll off and the current economic environment will impact our pricing power adding to short-term margin pressure, but nothing we haven't successfully navigated through before. In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins increased 90 basis points to 18.9%. Positive comparative sales were partly offset by higher labor and other costs around the region. We have an effective price increase in APMEA of about 1% and similar to Europe, it varies by market. Now turning to franchise margins. Third quarter franchise margin dollars rose to $1.7 billion, an increase of 9% in constant currencies. The consolidated franchise margin percent increased 60 basis points to 83.3% driven by positive global comparable sales. The third component of combined operating margin is G&A which we continue to actively manage. For the third quarter, G&A was up slightly due in part to increased incentive compensation accruals based on our strong results. Fourth quarter G&A should be relatively flat resulting in a full year increase of about 3%. On the other operating income line, similar to last quarter, we experienced lower gains on sales of restaurants in the third quarter compared with the prior year. More broadly speaking, the components of other operating income often include items such as gains, asset disposition costs, asset write-offs in part due to reimaging, and other unique items. Since many of these items are transactional in nature, it makes comparisons between certain quarters difficult. This was the case in the third quarter, and we also expect comparisons will be challenging in the fourth quarter where our current estimate for total other operating income is less than half of the $67 million recognized in fourth quarter 2009. Let's now move on to something I know you're all very interested in, the cash generated from our operations. Our first priority for this cash is to reinvest in our business to build strong sales, profitability and returns. We have slightly trimmed our 2010 CapEx estimate from $2.4 billion to $2.3 billion, primarily due to currency translation and fewer completions of reimaging projects in the U.S. versus our original budget. This was a purposeful and strategic reduction which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Approximately half of our capital expenditures are spent on our existing restaurants. As we expect to reimage approximately 1,800 restaurants around the world this year, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the activities in our three major segments. In the U.S., we have completed about 40 sites and expect another 350 restaurants to be reimaged within six months. We're being very deliberate in our approach, testing different designs, closely examining our costs, and making sure that we have adequate sales history post-reimaging to evaluate the returns. In short, we're focused on doing this right versus doing it quickly. While it is still early, given the relative small sample size and limited timeframe, preliminary results are in line with or better than our initial 6% to 7% incremental sales list estimates. Most importantly, we're encouraged by the support of our owner/operators who are leading this transformation of this brand in the U.S. In Europe, we have reimaged about 500 restaurants through September primarily in our largest markets: France, the U.K. and Germany. Europe plans to have about 90% of its interiors remodeled by 2012. Exterior reimaging tends to take longer due to permitting time and other regulations. In APMEA, we are leveraging some of the European designs and are focused on both interior and exterior remodels, particularly in China and Japan. Australia is virtually 100% reimaged. In addition to reinvestment, we are spending the other half of our capital expenditures to open new restaurants. We are on track to open 1,000 new restaurants this year. Approximately half of these openings will be in APMEA including 150 to 175 in China. Another 250 new restaurants will be opened in Europe, primarily in Russia, France and Germany. The U.S. has already opened about 100 restaurants, well on its way to a total of 150 new restaurants this year. And the remaining 100 restaurants will be opened in Latin America and Canada. Now let's spend a few minutes talking foreign currency. As you know, exchange rates have changed significantly since I last updated you. At current rates, we now expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by only $0.01 resulting in a full year benefit from currency translation of about $0.01. As I have said before, current volatility renders any estimate outdated within days, so please take this as directional guidance only. As most of you know, we believe constant currency results provide a more complete picture of the underlying strength of our business. In closing, I'm proud to say that the focused execution of our system behind the Plan to Win, the entrepreneurial power of our owner/operators who are widening the gap versus our competition, and our disciplined operational and financial controls continue to drive our business forward. We will be entering 2011 from a position of strength. We remain confident in our sales momentum and our system alignment has never been better. We are currently finalizing 2011 planning, visiting markets around the world and meeting with our local management teams who are focused on executing against our key business drivers, optimizing our menu, modernizing the McDonald's experience and broadening our accessibility. Though the global environment remains challenging, I'm confident McDonald's can continue to deliver long-term growth and value for our system and our shareholders. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analysts and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] First question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer: Two areas of curiosity for me, ongoing curiosity, I suppose. The pricing decisions that you make and just generally speaking, the outlook for Europe. You gave us some comment there about pricing rolling off and limited pricing power in some European markets. I think that was you, Pete, that said that. Perhaps you could talk about pricing power being on the eve of inflation. And obviously, there's a lot of markets where it looks like you sure do have pricing power. How are you thinking about that?\nPeter Bensen: Sure. What we know is as we look at and we've dealt with it in our European business over the years, as VAT increases start to come along, we have to be very smart about how we handle that through the menu board. We know the wrong answer is to immediately increase prices the full amount of that VAT increase. So we look at doing it in smaller pieces. Sometimes, we try to get a little bit ahead of the VAT increase, do it in small chunks. But really, if you look across the whole continent as you indicate, the economies are in various forms of recovery. So we really look at the individual markets, what's the consumer's appetite to pay a little more? What is going on with inflation? So as you point out, as we look at least preliminarily into Europe next year, we think commodity costs will be up about 3%. That is not an unreasonable number for us to manage through. And if inflation is a sign that the economies are picking up a little bit and the consumer will be able to pay a little more, then we certainly ought to be able to handle that through the menu board. But as we sit here today, we're just not exactly sure in which markets and when that will be. But to our business model in total, that type of increase in commodities is not insurmountable.\nJim Skinner: And David, our business model, this is Jim, will endure there in the European marketplace particularly when you look at these VAT increases. They're not robust increases. They're incremental increases. And the population there wouldn't be able to absorb enormous increases. And so I think as we operate throughout the year, as Pete indicated, we'll be able to mitigate the impact of those increases in our business model. We'll be able to perform well in that environment.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Jeff Omohundro at Wells Fargo.\nJeffrey Omohundro: I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the impressive domestic sales momentum that was reported throughout the quarter and in particular in the September period. And also particularly interested in the mixed sustainability of the frappes and smoothies into the fall and into the cooler weather. And if you consider continuing the marketing support of those items out of their traditional season.\nJim Skinner: Jeff, this is Jim. Don, of course, very close to that combined beverage initiative in the U.S. and he's in Mexico. Don, can you take Jeff's question?\nDonald Thompson: Yes, Jim. A couple things. One is frappes and smoothies are performing very well. Again as we mentioned, they're exceeding expectations that we had. You asked about the seasonality. The products do have some seasonality to them. Having said that though, that has all been kind of baked into our model as we look at the overall sales contribution. It's important to note that everyone kind of grabs hold to frappes and smoothies, keeping in mind breakfast is a strong contributor in the U.S. We still have a tremendous amount of sales coming in from Angus. Angus is still performing well. Jim talked about the Angus Snack Wraps. There will be additional media and a continuous weight of media relative to frappes and smoothies in the U.S. But also even broader, we still have an opportunity relative to the broader McCafe coffee. So I know the U.S. team is going to be marketing those products as well. So there's quite a few things that will be coming up. Jim talked about the McRib, which is something we haven't done nationally. We've done in the spot markets but nationally. So ongoing strength-wise relative to the U.S., the U.S. plan is solid and we're looking forward to also a very strong 2011.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from David Tarantino, Robert Baird.[Robert W. Baird]\nDavid Tarantino: Pete, I have a question for you maybe falling on to the first question about the cost outlook and how you might manage that heading into 2011. I know you mentioned European commodities are expected to be up 3%, but if you could maybe give a broader picture of what that might look like globally including in the U.S. and also talk about labor trends. And with that, are there any efficiency opportunities maybe that you could use to offset some of that pressure?\nPeter Bensen: I don't have a global commodity number, but in the U.S., we think the number is closer to a 2% increase. And again, that's a very manageable number for us and nothing that we're terribly concerned about. So all in all, from an input cost side, we feel pretty good about heading into 2011. Labor, virtually all markets around the world are seeing increases in labor, but nothing that is again out of the ordinary or something that's so extreme that we'd have to do something dramatic in our pricing or suffer some dramatic hit to margins. So both commodities and labor, while going up, are in line with kind of what I'd -- go back to kind of some more normal trends for our business. And historically, we've said in the U.S., we need a 2% to 3% comp in normal times and Europe probably a 3% plus comp in normal times to grow margins. And so I consider this more normal times from the input cost side. The question will be exactly at what point will we be able to take some of that pricing? But our early look at some of the 2011 plans, markets are anticipating they'll be able to take some pricing next year. From an efficiency standpoint to offset some of that, we're constantly looking at operations within the restaurants. And one of the big enhancements we're in the process of rolling out through the U.S. is our new POS system which makes it easier for the crew to take the orders, easier to get the order right, they can do it faster. And basically what that means is increased throughput especially during our peak hours which makes us more efficient per labor hour.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: On the U.S. remodeling program you talked about, Pete, just remind us where you thought you'd be at the year-end and where you're coming out and again the specific reasons. Was there something about delaying getting construction permits or was there something about not getting enough data to read? And you talk about a 6% to 7% lift in here. Can you talk about though over time if you have a greater expectation? What the sort of three to five-year expectation is in terms of sales lift to those remodels?\nPeter Bensen: Yes, John. I'll give you a perspective and certainly if Don or Jim want to jump in, they can do that. I think we started out with an aggressive goal this year. We felt we'd do 400 to 500 starting out and it looks like we'll probably end up doing 200 by the end of the year, maybe 225. And really, as I said in my comments, as we started the initial wave of this, we wanted to make sure that as we really have one chance to get this right. And while we realize there's an opportunity to strike right now because we have the financial strength and the momentum, that's still not a reason just to go quickly if you don't have everything exactly nailed down. So we're making sure we've got the design's right, that we've got the quality of the materials right, that we've got the pricing right and, like I said, it's because we really have one chance to do this right and we're going to do it. I would see that 200 number this year probably go up to 600 in 2011 based on the plans. So there is momentum and something that we're very encouraged about the operator participation in. When we talked about the sales lift, the 6% to 7% was our initial estimate. And that lift, just to remind you, is incremental to what's happening in the marketplace and that we know over time that, that sales halo continues in that restaurant. We don't have a five-year track record of these things in the U.S. to tell you over five years what's going to happen. But our instincts tell us that those sales will continue to be positive primarily because of the opportunity it gives us to introduce new menu items, introduce new customers back to that restaurant, et cetera. So we're very bullish on the opportunity it provides not only in year one, but sustaining.\nDonald Thompson: John,I think it's really important to note, and Pete mentioned this, in the U.S. one of the things we've been able to benefit from is the fact we've seen France and Australia move forward. In particular, Australia move forward even more aggressively relative to reimaging. So we've been able to take some of those ideas and the things that did work very well from those markets and really employ them in the U.S. designs as we move forward. Another point is that the U.S. designs are both internal and external at the same time. And so we're not just doing the internals of the restaurant. Some of those have been done a while ago. We're refreshing those. But this is the full reimage process that we're going through. So we wanted to make sure we got it right. We consciously slowed down and went back and revisited the design. Some of them we didn't think actually were aggressive enough in designs, and the franchisees have been a major, major part of how we've looked at that. When we've looked at the results in Australia and in Europe, across Europe, the second and the third years have been very positive as we continue to move forward largely because of the reasons that Pete mentioned around menu as well as the awareness from customers. And the last point is, we know that as we get more and more of these done in the marketplace, there is a broader synergy that takes place from a consumer awareness perspective and that allows us to be able to reap the benefits of that in even stronger sales. So we feel real confident about where we are in the U.S. and I know that as we move into next year, the franchisees are ready to be more aggressive as well as our teams are ready to be more aggressive as we move forward. We've got the right designs now. So we feel pretty good about it.\nMary Kay Shaw: . The next question is from Andrew Barish at Jefferies.\nAndrew Barish: Just a question on kind of European brand relevance. I mean, do you think you've made kind of a sea change in your European business over the years? And does that show up in terms of more breadth on the daypart, less kind of weekend, special occasion business? And how does that make you feel just kind of going forward with maybe some economic bumps in the road, are you better prepared to kind of ride those out than maybe in the past?\nJim Skinner: Andy, this is Jim. I don't know that we could point to a sea change in Europe in specific. I think we've seen a sea change and the relevance for our consumers across the globe. And so Europe, of course, is pursuing the same Plan to Win that we're pursuing in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa, the United States. We're very aligned around the consumer relevance issues and what we're doing around reimaging menu and all of the every day affordability access and improvement in the drive-thru which is a big one for Europe because they are adding more and more drive-thrus now. And as you heard from my comments, the improvement on customer satisfaction particularly in the drive-thru accuracy and speed of service in markets outside the United States, and including the United States, is paying dividends. But I don't think that there's anything there in the brand that would differentiate Europe relative to a sea change that changes the visit mix or the opportunity for our customers to visit McDonald's. If that's what you're asking. And maybe I didn't understand the question, but I think that's...\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Jason West at Deutsche Bank.\nJason West: I just want to touch back on the margin outlook for next year and I guess focus a bit on the U.S. Just how you guys -- you mentioned you think you have some room to take price in some markets. I'm wondering if you guys are still looking at the CPI away from home as kind of an indicator on where you'd like to focus the pricing. And if you could talk about the overall competitive environment in the U.S., if you feel like things have started to flatten out or even get a little better?\nPeter Bensen: Jason, it's Pete. As we have said before, you touched on it. One of the things we look at is what's going on with the food away from home index, and that's actually up a little bit on a trailing 12-month basis ended September. But also during the last economic downturn, if you will, we started to look also at food at home, what's going on at the grocery stores. Because as Don likes to say, the refrigerator is starting to become a big competitor of ours. And so food at home is still flat to down slightly as we look at the period. So we will be keeping an eye on what's going on both at the grocery stores and in the competitive market as we look at our pricing. But obviously, the momentum that we have, some of these premium beverages, while they don't necessarily qualify as a price increase, but introducing these premium beverages with high margins is definitely helping an accretive to cash flow as maybe we aren't able to take price on some other items. But we'll definitely be actively looking at the opportunities. And again, with some optimism, the economy is going to start to get a little bit stronger next year and we'll get some price increase.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Matt DiFrisco at Oppenheimer.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Just looking at, I guess, following on that, the question about the premium beverages. And as we look at it leaving the U.S. more so and going global with some of these new products that have been very successful in the U.S., on a gross profit dollar basis, and I guess overall on a regional margin basis, should we expect then factoring in everything that you highlighted as far as commodity costs and labor pressure? Would Europe then potentially be going back to the days of actually maybe potentially having higher margins again than the U.S. if you look on a store level, if I'm looking at your branded company-owned basis, as we bring in these higher gross profit margin items and higher margin items to the stores?\nDonald Thompson: Hey Matt, this is Don. And a couple of things on that. One is the other areas of the world. Clearly Europe has looked at some of the other premium beverages, is particularly looking at frappes and smoothies. They've done one offering of those type beverages, but they're looking at the U.S. execution. APMEA is looking at the same thing. From a margin perspective, keep in mind that as we implement some of the higher margin products, we're also looking at our tiered value offerings. So we're also looking at what we do in terms of breakfast offerings to stimulate that daypart which is a huge opportunity for us across the big four in Europe. We're looking at the same things relative to the regular value menu. They brought back in Europe the Double Cheeseburger in France. And the question is relative to what happens economically. To Jim's point earlier, our model allows us to be able to flex the pricing in and out of that relative to what the economy will yield and what the discretionary spending will look like. So keep in mind, it's not just about the implementation of beverages. That's one part. But it's also what we do with the rest of that menu. What beverages and higher margin products allow us to do is to be able to afford to execute our value platforms so that we can continue to gain market share and grow guest counts. That's really the biggest goal that we have in economic downturns, protect and grow the guest counts which then yield us higher levels of profitability.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley: One statistical question. You shared with us the China same-store sales number for the third quarter of 12.7%. Could you share with us what that was up against in the third quarter of 2009. And then a broader question again on margins. I'm curious on the 2% commodity inflation outlook in the U.S., how visible that is to you, how much of that you might have contracted or hedged? And just in general on the margins, if I'm not mistaken, the 22% level, both the U.S. and Europe, is probably an all-time record, and I realize there is some seasonality around that. But when we talk about the sustainability of the 2009 margin performance, if you do have even just a slight headwinds in food costs, are these levels sustainable?\nPeter Bensen: All right. Joe, the 2% increase in the fourth quarter in the U.S., we have a pretty fair amount of visibility in. So a fair amount of that is contracted, locked in. And so that number feels pretty solid to me. And even heading into 2011, I'm not going to give specific percentages, but we're probably more contracted at this point in time versus any other year previous. So while it's still early, our 2011 estimate feels pretty good too. The quarterly margins, the third quarter margins are actually kind of just off of their all-time highs for both Europe and the U.S. But as I think about 2011 more broadly and think about some of the comments I made earlier, in an environment with about 2% inflation and normal wage increases, in that environment, really a 2% to 3% comp is what we need to grow the annual margin. And so with the momentum that we have and the outlook of being able to take some price, to keep driving the guest counts with these beverages and the breakfast value, et cetera, we feel pretty confident that's doable.\nJim Skinner: I think Joe, we get this question often, obviously we get it externally and internally, and our answer is always the same. We focus on the top line growth and ensuring the traffic into our restaurants, and the rest has to take care of itself. It doesn't mean that we're not smart about how we price on the menu and how we introduce new products. But we play it as wise, if you will, relative to the commodity costs other than what we are able to hedge, as Pete mentioned. And so the concern that I have with the segments around the world and the planning process is what are we doing about continuing to drive top line and preserving the increases in traffic into our restaurants. When we take care of that, as Pete mentioned certainly at the 2% to 3% level, all else falls into line.\nPeter Bensen: And Joe, you asked a question about last year's comp in China. Last year, the quarterly comp was our easiest comparison. It was a negative 10.7, but still this year's number and the momentum going on there, we're extremely proud of the team in China and what's going on there.\nDonald Thompson: And Pete, for Joe too, and for everyone else on the call. One thing that's really impressive about China now is they're being able to benefit from not only the historical regular menu, but also breakfast now is becoming a stronger and stronger daypart for China, the Value Lunch program that they have in place. They did some very aggressive things with summer drinks this year. Jim mentioned drive-thru expansions earlier. We're confident in the development plan. So China is -- has a very good strategic plan both now and again as we move into 2011. So it's not just about whether or not you comped on a weaker number last year. The way that we're comping now and the opportunity for continued growth is pretty strong.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Larry Miller at RBC.\nLarry Miller: Can you guys give us any sense of how the business in the U.S. breakfast is trending since BK rolled out their new menu? And then the second part of that is looks you guys had a nice acceleration in September in same-store sales, looks like the fast food market overall is getting better. Any thoughts you could share relative that would be great.\nJim Skinner: Hey, Larry. This is Jim. First of all, relative to the overall segment and the improvement, we continue to look at the same things. As Pete mentioned, the consumer spending, the consumer confidence went down in September, unemployment still at 9.6% and the recovery, we think, is going to be elongated in America. And so if you look over the next 12 months, I think people are still talking about maybe getting to 8.5% or 9% unemployment when we know that normalized unemployment rates in a robust economy are 4% or 5% at the most. And so we've got a long way to go there relative to consumer confidence and that confidence of people being able to put food on the table at home or away from home. And I think jobs have a lot to do with it. So the improvement in the overall segment in September, I don't think is necessarily an earmark or a bellwether of things to come relative to the overall recovery except to say that we're certainly pleased with our performance and the fact that the rest of the industry is starting to come around is good for them. But I think in an overall indicator, that's probably not something that we would look at to say, \"We'll, we are in the middle of a recovery.\"\nPeter Bensen: And we continue to outperform the industry. So our gap with the industry continues to be significant. And we're proud of that. And regarding the breakfast question, we haven't seen any impact from the Burger King rollout.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Two things, one, just a follow-up on the European results. I know there's a lot of speculation around the deceleration in August and clearly this was a very strong re-acceleration in September. Just wondering whether you can offer any incremental thoughts, and it is going to be tough to pass along all of the VAT increases on the menu board. But in terms of the austerity measures, perhaps McDonald's positioning versus where you are on the U.S., perhaps you're more lower end or maybe which markets you might think are most or least vulnerable with the big changes coming up in Europe. And then separately just on the shareholder value front that you guys mentioned earlier. Is there any potential to increase leverage perhaps to return more capital to holders either through additional repo or dividend? I think you guys have talked about the potential willingness to move in that direction.\nJim Skinner: I'll let Pete respond to most of that, but let me just respond to the big ballyhoo over August in Europe. Europe had a little bit of a glitch in August mostly around France. Everybody got all concerned. That's because France did not run the promotion that many of the other markets ran in August which was the Coca-Cola glass promotion. And they did not perform as well as the other markets. And yet it was not a trend. It was a one-month occurrence. And we're still optimistic and they're back on track and things are moving along well there.\nDonald Thompson: Jeff, can I just add something to -- Jeff, you mentioned lower end in the U.S. Just as a point of clarity, smoothies, frappes, Angus, salads, those aren't lower end. And we have had a good mix across the menu board and it's really important to note that value still only represents 10% to 11% if you look at the regular menu value offerings and platform. The coffee beverages, McCaf\u00e9 beverages, are definitely not lower end, and consumers tell us that they prefer the beverages. And there's a tremendous amount of those beverages sold during the morning daypart as well as across the afternoon. All dayparts are up in the U.S. business. So just a point of clarity. I think that when you look at the U.S. business, it may appear that it's value-driven. But value helps, but we've got good mix across the board just as we have in Europe.\nPeter Bensen: And specifically about which markets are going to be hit harder with the austerity, et cetera, Jeff, I guess as we look at the continent I would just look at the last couple of years performance. That's what gives us the confidence. We know that while we prefer a more robust environment to operate in that if times get a little tougher, that we've got the ability to continue to attract customers and to continue to perform well. Regarding additional leverage, our debt balances are up this year a little bit compared to last year and that's consistent with our plan that every year as the business performs well and grows bigger that we have an opportunity to add some incremental leverage to the balance sheet to return cash to shareholders. But we're not planning to do any significant leverage event.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Mitch Speiser, Buckingham Research.\nMitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research: My question is on Europe, and in particular, Germany, U.K., France. Can you update us on what the drive-thru mix is in those markets? And what the opportunity is over the next couple of years in terms of increasing that mix? And on the frappes, do you think it can have the impact that it has had in the U.S. and if these drive-thru mix and frappes growth could -- should we view it as perhaps an offset to what is happening in Europe with VAT taxes and weak economy and austerity plans? And just as a sidenote to that, can you let us know the experience you've had when VAT taxes have gone up in Europe and how comp trends have changed?\nPeter Bensen: Mitch, in Europe our drive-thru percentage is about a little over 60%. And that's probably about the same in those big markets. So that's not the percentage of sales through the drive-thru. That's the percentage of restaurants that have drive-thru. And the percentage of sales in those restaurants is closer to 45%. And so when you think about the U.S. being 67% drive-thru, that's a huge opportunity for us to increase that. And that's why Jim had referenced it, it's a focus area for Europe. They know there's opportunities not only to add more drive-thrus to satisfy that demand, but also to improve those drive-thru operations to attract more customers. Historically, as Jim mentioned, these VAT tax increases are probably going to be more incremental than they are substantial. And in the past, you've had VAT increases that have tended to be more substantial and so you had to take a longer period to get those bled into the menu board, if you will. And so again I'm not sure there's a historical comparison for us to make, especially considering the economic environment and all else that's going on. But again, I get back to the confidence we have in our ability to manage through this with our business model and new products. The beverages certainly will help. I don't know that they'll have -- at least as of now as you look into 2011, they probably won't be as impactful in Europe as they are in the U.S. But certainly over time, all of the markets have beverages in their plans and on their plates to take a look at.\nJim Skinner: The other thing that I would say is if you look at Europe, the populations are very supported by social programs. And so when you talk about austerity in these countries, it's much about the benefits. If you look at France now, they're talking about raising the retirement age to 62 years old. Everybody's in a big flap. But what does that do to discretionary income for customers who could visit McDonald's? It's de minimis. And so the impact around a number of these austerity programs will not have a severe impact on discretionary spending of our consumers because they are supported at very high level already relative to social services and the other support they get from the government. So we've been able to absorb that over the years and, as Pete said, we will be able to do this as well during the coming months.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Keith Siegner, Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner: I might turn around the answer from that question a little bit. Looking at the U.S. business, with the free WiFi, with the McCaf\u00e9, with the snacking and now most importantly with this new remodel program, does this change at all the mix in drive-thru versus eat-in let's say sit and stay or could it potentially increase that mix a little bit? And if that were to happen, does this change or open up maybe some of the new product development over the next couple of years if that happens?\nJim Skinner: I think it could possibly change the mix over time. That is not why we have pursued those strategies. We pursued those strategies because we want to offer our customers those opportunities for convenience, and they're relevant to their lifestyles today. And I think when I look at the population and their lifestyles today, I couldn't make an argument, I think, for a change in their behavior is relative to the use of the drive-thru. The convenience of how people are on the move all the time now, I don't know that we would see a substantial change there. Having said that though, it doesn't mean that we won't pursue other menu opportunities over time to enhance the opportunity for people to come into the restaurant as compared to going through the drive-thru.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: What kind of benefit are you seeing for the new point-of-sale system, whether in cost? And I guess that includes cost of training and speed of service with the new hardware platform. And secondly, Pete, I mean you kind of mentioned it regarding a leverage event but your profitability per store, your debt to EBITDA, your debt to free cash flow seems to be so conservative right now and the cost of debt being at extremely, extremely low levels especially for a company like yours, even on a 10 or perhaps even a 30-year basis. Could you kind of walk through just a little bit more in terms of why it doesn't make sense for McDonald's to pursue a leverage event at this point?\nDonald Thompson: I can take the first one. New POS benefit, and we call the system new POS. What we're seeing John is first to benefit in terms of the ordering ease for the crew in the restaurants, which does give us some benefit in order-taking time. So we do see some benefit there, which as you know, seconds mean additional capacity. And so we're happy about that one. The broader benefits of the new technology system is that it opens up additional applications such as handheld order-taking within the restaurant and as well outside the restaurant. It also opens up additional visibility relative to how we can get the orders back into the kitchen. And again, increase the speed at which we have the food prepared. So we do see those operational benefits relative to the new technology system and also some additional platforms that we could benefit from.\nPeter Bensen: And regarding the conservative position of our balance sheet, John, that's kind of our profile. Our strong credit rating is important to us. It's important to us as a company, but also to the system. So even though we don't guarantee or do anything like that with our loans for suppliers and owner/operators, the strong credit rating of the corporation provides a halo for them and they're able to borrow at rates inside that of our competitors. And so that's important to us. And we're going to return at least $5 billion to shareholders this year. And we plan to grow free cash flow and return all that next year to shareholders and incrementally increase the debt. So we think that's a very successful model for us and one we're very comfortable both from the way we operate the business, the way the system is financed and the value we're providing to shareholders.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Nicole Miller Regan at Piper Jaffray.\nJoshua Long - Stephens Inc: This is Josh [Joshua Long] in for Nicole. I just want to circle back to your gap to the overall QSR industry. I think previously, we had quantified that. And then also, any commentary and has that continued to accelerate of late, as it had in 2Q?\nDonald Thompson: Josh, the gap relative to competition has continued. And I think you're primarily talking about the U.S. It's just where we normally talk about the gap. However, I will say that we're going market share in all the major markets around the world. So we're continuing to grow share even in cases where some of our competitors may be growing a few more units. So that part of the business is strong. In the U.S., that gap again does maintain and we're continuing to gap the competition. And I'd also offer, our numbers last year were still positive numbers. And so we're gapping the competition at a time when their comp numbers are in some cases going up against much softer comps than we had. So again, business is pretty strong in the U.S. right now.\nPeter Bensen: And that gap for the quarter was about 5% in the U.S.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Sara Senatore at Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Two follow up questions, one was on China and one on the U.S. The first on China, you gave us the comparisons year-over-year and some of the initiatives that sound like they've been very successful. But we're hearing that at least in some of the bigger cities, there's been a decent amount of price being taken in, at least some of the menu items. And so just trying to get a sense of, a, are you taking more price there in, let's say, other emerging markets that you might develop markets? And, b, does it vary depending on your geographic -- on what geographic region we're talking about, big cities versus sort of the smaller cities inside the country. And then I'll throw in my question on the U.S. so just in case I get cut off which is, can you just update us on some of the health care legislation? I know your company has been in the news with talks about waivers and that kind of thing. So I just wanted to see if you have any sort of incremental data.\nJim Skinner: This is Jim. I'll talk about the health care, while these guys figure out what to tell you about the pricing in China. First of all, the Act was signed into law in March of 2010 and now they're going through a lot of sorting out of the details relative to the full implication which doesn't happen until 2014. And so the Administration continues to work very hard with companies like McDonald's to sort this out to make sure that we are implementing this the appropriate way so that most people that have access to health care are going to be covered appropriately. The flap that I'm sure you're referring to had to do with the limited benefit plans, the mini meds as they were called, that covers some 30,000 people in McDonald's, but 1.4 million people across America, which is interesting to know. And there was a headline saying that we were going to drop coverage. Well, we were never ever going to drop coverage. We're always going to provide coverage. But the regulations around the insurance companies and their obligations to cover these mini med plans was in jeopardy without a waiver. Well, now we think that Health and Human Services is going to be very good about giving waivers to companies that are going to be able to continue to cover these very important people on these smaller plans. Other than that, there's not a lot more to say about health care. Certainly there's a lot of pushback on the one side of the aisle relative to the Republicans and the midterm elections and everything going on here. But for us, the diligent work around proper implementation of this plan, both with our franchisees, through the Administration and were working closely with them to make sure we get it right, is where we're spending our time. And that's really all we have to say at the moment, and it's a work in progress.\nPeter Bensen: And in terms of pricing, Sara, in China I would characterize any price increase we've had over the last 12 months as modest. We said the APMEA averaged around 1% and China was probably in line with that. In other emerging markets, I mean, Russia is probably the one where we've had the greatest input inflation and the highest amount of price increase.\nMary Kay Shaw: We had one other one, Peter Saleh from Telsey Advisory Group.\nPeter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on coffee as a percentage of sales and how that compares to last year at this time? And just where do you think that could go to over the next year?\nDonald Thompson: Coffee percentages in the U.S., as you all know, several years ago we were at about, I think in 2004, we were at about 2% coffee. Total coffee's grown to over 6%. So a lot of -- and that really includes the whole McCaf\u00e9 line up. So really positive growth there. Jim mentioned U.K. In the U.K., we sell now the most coffee of any other purveyors that are there. We see opportunities in many of our other markets whether that be in Europe, across the other markets like France. Germany, we have 600 McCaf\u00e9's that are there. So we're continuing to grow our coffee business there. So we do see coffee as a point of leverage and growth for us as we move forward.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. I think we're out of time now and out of questions. So I'll go ahead and turn it over to Jim for a few closing remarks.\nJim Skinner: Thank you, Mary Kay. Thanks for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reiterate that McDonald's global business is strong, the system alignment behind our Plan to Win and its focus on the customer. We will continue to deliver results. We will further strengthen our leadership position through collective efforts around our menu, restaurants and the entire brand experience. In working together, I'm confident that we'll continue to drive long-term growth and become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink. Thank you, all. Have a great day.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-04-21 17:56:09", "content": "McDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD):\nExecutives: Mary Kay Shaw \u2013 VP, IR Jim Skinner \u2013 Vice Chairman and CEO Pete Bensen \u2013 EVP and CFO Don Thompson \u2013 President and COO\nAnalysts: David Palmer \u2013 UBS David Tarantino \u2013 Robert Baird Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo Joe Buckley \u2013 BofA\\Merrill Lynch Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse Larry Miller \u2013 RBC Matt Van Vliet \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus Howard Penney \u2013 Hedgeye Risk Management\nOperator: Hello and welcome to the McDonald's April 21st 2010 investor conference call.

As our reconciliations of any non\u2013GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures, and now I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJim Skinner: Thanks Mary Kay. Good morning everybody. I'm joining you from our McDonald's Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in Orlando. Every two years we bring together our franchisees from around the world and along with a number of our suppliers and company employees we celebrate our success, but mostly we calibrate about our future. But we're in the middle of it now and it's been a tremendous week so far. From the Convention floor to our business meetings, we are focused on operations, menu, reinvestment and building this great brand. ' We're sharing ideas and learning from each other further strengthening our alignment, which I know is critical to our future success. We're energized and confident about what we're doing regarding our business and taking our business to the next level. So as we come together and looked ahead I'm proud of the results we achieved this quarter. Global comparable sales were up 4.2%. Operating income increased 13% in constant currency and earnings per share reached $1, a 9% increase in constant currency. Our success continues to be a system wide effort driven by strong results in each area of the world. In the U.S. comparable sales for the quarter increased 1.5% and operating income grew 12%. Comparable sales in Europe rose 5.2% and operating income grew 14% in constant currencies and in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 5.7% with operating income rising 9% in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing at April with comparable sales trending positive across all of our geographies. We are now into our seventh year of positive comp sales growth in every part of the world, a feat that underscores the ongoing strength and relevance of our plan to win business strategy. Guided by the plan, we continue to focus on differentiating our brands through common business drivers, mainly a variety of beverage choice, better restaurant operations, convenience in daypart expansion, everyday predictable low prices and ongoing restaurant reinvestment. On all of these fronts we're improving and re\u2013innovating. As a result, we are growing our business in widening our market share lead around the world. Together, we're aligned around these drivers in delivering them in the most locally relevant liege. Regarding menu, we made gains by promoting our iconic core products while delivering new food and beverage news. In the U.S. as growing Olympic theme promotion help ignite our Chicken McNuggets sales and drove sustained sales growth across our entire chicken category. Our new product news included McSnack Wrap with all the great taste of Big Mac and a portable wrap which has helped lift the entire Snack Wrap line or category across the menu. Looking ahead, the U.S. is continuing the expansion of McCaf\u00e9 line with the introduction of Frappes and Smoothies. Frappe is now around about 90% of the U.S. Restaurants, and are already exceeding expectations, and that's without any national advertising, and later this summer we will be launching Wild Berry and Straw Berry Banana Smoothies. With these new additions were becoming even more of the beverage destination serving familiar and popular drinks with the quality convenience and value that only McDonald's can provide. Looking at Europe, we continue to delight customers and drive sales with our fourth tier menu offerings, which deliver a popular option of smaller premium portable sandwiches. Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany have both delivered solid sales results and our latest line of Petit plaisirs in France has exceeded expectations. Europe is also driving momentum with its premium offerings from the Big Tasty in France and the Chicken Bacon Onion Sandwich in the U.K. to the launch of McKinley Burgers, which have performed strongly across our entire market. In APMEA, Japan has driven sales with its recent line of American theme burgers. In addition the number of markets are rolling out extensive campaigns to elevate our core products including the upcoming launch of our Quarter Pounder in Singapore. We also continue to offer strong value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonalds for branded affordability. In China, we've maintained our popular value lunch which is driving guest counts and sales. In the U.S. we launched our Dollar Menu with breakfast to provide the kind of everyday predictable value our customers expect from us. As a result, we've reinvigorated this vital daypart and experienced strong sales in guest count gross into the first quarter. Meanwhile everyday affordability and pricing from our value menus remains a strong traffic driver across Europe and year\u2013to\u2013date our extra value meals throughout Europe have been extremely robust. Italy saw 30% increases as they supported the Big Mac while France experienced strong extra value meal growth and the U.K, Germany and Spain also achieved strong results. So we're continuing to drive traffic as we connect with consumers through core menus, favorites, new food news and the most relevant value offerings and we're complimenting it with even better all around restaurant experience from how our restaurants look to how they are operated to the convenience they provide in our customers daily lives. As many of you know, we have a system wide effort to re\u2013image and modernize our locations inside and out. Australia and Europe have led the way and our other geographies have seen the benefits and are leveraging these learning's. In the U.S. over the past few years we've refreshed about one third of our restaurants with an emphasis on the interior. This year, the U.S. will re\u2013image 400 to 500 restaurants, concentrating on both the interior and exterior. In China, where we're celebrating our 20th anniversary we have an extensive plan to refresh our current restaurants and still plan to open between 150 to 175 new restaurants this year. Wherever we have critical mass, our re\u2013imaged restaurants were seeing improved perception of our brand and higher sales and returns. As in Australia where many of our brand perception scores have increased over the last three years and we've delivered a three year return on incremental invest in capital of more than 60%. We feel this initiative will set the stage to take the McDonald's brand well into the future. The strength of the brand is also dependent on great service through innovative technology and better training of our people; we will continue to enhance the experience of our customers. APMEA continues to lead the way generating our top customer satisfaction scores year\u2013to\u2013date. In particular, China and Japan are truly differentiating our brand on service with Japan achieving its best satisfaction scores ever earlier this year. The U.S. and Europe have also continued to make great progress on improving their customer satisfaction scores. This is a key measure that we pay very close attention to in order to ensure we are getting better at being better. Key to Europe's results have been nearly full implementation of our bridge operating platform, which creates a better organized kitchen increases capacity and puts less pressure on the crew through simplified operations. Its now a nearly 90% of our European restaurants and it enables us to expand our menu variety at the same time improving our customer service. Finally, we are leveraging greater convenience in daypart expansion to continue to drive growth. In the U.S. more than one third of our restaurants are now open 24 hours, and we know there are opportunities to do more. In addition, nearly 80% of our stores are now open by 5:00 a.m. continuing to add to the comp for that particular daypart. In APMEA, convenience remains a key driver of our business. Our McDonald's Celebrity Service now operates in 19 countries throughout the region and contributed to measurable comp growth in China, Hong Kong and Korea. Our continued expansion of 24 hour service drove sales in Japan and Australia, improvements and drive through execution across all markets erupt a greater capacity in cash flow. Meanwhile we've now made breakfast available in 75% of our restaurants in APMEA, and we are excited about the tremendous opportunity that breakfast provides. So those are a few highlights on how the momentum is continuing this year. We are delivering the food and beverages our customers want, they value they expect and an overall dining experience that is modern, relevant and in step with our customers lives. We are committed to our business plans and our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. We have a healthy balance sheet and the highest credit rating in the industry allowing us to access capital and help facilitate owner owner/operators to obtain the credit they need to reinvest in their restaurants. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long\u2013term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase and in the first quarter we returned $1 billion to shareholders. Overall I'm very pleased by our first quarter performance and confident that we will continue to achieve strong results. What I've experienced at this weeks meeting is encouraging and motivating. Our entire system is determined to get even better and all we deliver to keep McDonalds moving forward. The optimism, confidence and alignment is truly inspiring and will continue. Thank you, and now I'll introduce Pete Bensen, our CFO. Pete Bensen Thanks Jim and hello everyone. As I walk our Convention floor and visit with people this week, it's even more clear to me that the system alignment behind our plan to win is the fuel that continues to drive increased sales, debt counts, cash flow and market share around the world. Owner/operators, suppliers and company employees are focused on satisfying the evolving needs of our customers by delivering unbeatable value, menu choice and convenience in a contemporary environment everyday in our restaurants. These collective efforts resulted in first quarter as reported operating income growth of 20% to nearly $1.7 billion. Every area of the world contributed with top line sales growth, effective management of expenses and strong margin performance. As a result, combined operating margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 30%. U.S. Company operating margins rose 210 basis points to 20.4% primarily due to lower food and paper cost and to a lesser extent, the impact to refranchising. For a perspective, the last time the quarterly U.S. Company operating margin exceeded 20.4% with second quarter 1994 nearly 16 years ago. We continue to experience lower commodity cost in the first quarter as our basket of goods in the U.S. decreased about 5%. This compares to the 6.7% increase in first quarter 2009. For the full\u2013year 2010, our commodity outlook in the U.S. is favorable with cost expected to be down 2% to 3%. Lower food and paper cost have allowed us to continue to grow margins while holding the line on price increases. We remain focused on building traffic, which is critical to growing our market share over the long\u2013term. Regarding Europe, Company operating margins increased 200 basis points in the first quarter to 17.3% down comparable sales in France, Russia, the U.K. and many other markets as well as lower commodity cost were partly offset by higher labor and occupancy cost. Broad currency pressures on imports in Russia and Eastern Europe have eased since last year which also benefited margins. Europe's grocery bill also declined 5% in the quarter and for the full\u2013year we expect commodity costs to be down slightly. In APMEA, company operated margins increased 220 basis points, also driven by lower commodity costs, operating efficiencies and positive comparable sales. Turning to franchise margins, we continue to benefit from a more heavily franchise structure as first quarter franchise margin dollars rose to nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency, driven in part by system wide sales growth of 6%. The consolidated franchise margin percent declined slightly, yet remains strong at 81.2%. Our positive global comparable sales were offset by higher depreciation cost in the U.S and the impact of refranchising. In addition the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar in the first quarter of 2010 negatively impacted the mix of APMEA's franchise margins. The final factor in our combined operating margin is G&A control. First quarter G&A increased in total dollars, but improved slightly as a percentage of revenues. This was in line with our internal expectations. As I mentioned on January's call, the timing of the Vancouver Winter Olympics and our biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention will impact quarterly comparisons this year. We still expect full year 2010 G&A to be up slightly on an as reported basis and relatively flat in constant currencies. As a system, we continue to concentrate on initiatives and assets that grow our business over the long\u2013term, where necessary tough decisions are being made to close certain capacity constraint sites. Japan, our 50% owned affiliate decided to close approximately 430 restaurants with lower volumes and returns by mid\u2013year 2011. Accordingly, our first quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $30 million after tax or $0.03 per share. We expect minimal additional charges for the remainder of the year. So, we are revising downward the total estimate for these costs in 2010 from $40 million to $50 million to less than $40 million. Somewhat offsetting the impairment charges in Japan were about $30 million in gains in our U.S. business from the dissolution of a few of our joint partnerships. These gains were reflected in other operating income. This is a continuation of our broader efforts to optimize our ownership mix, to leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of our proven owner/operators and enhance our portfolio of Company operated restaurants. While pruning underperforming assets in certain markets and continuing ownership optimization certainly makes us stronger. We are also focused on the opportunity to build future returns and enhance long\u2013term shareholder value with new restaurant development and re\u2013imaging of our existing restaurants. Re\u2013imaging as contributed to sustain momentum and outstanding returns in France, Australia and other markets, that have a significant percentage of contemporary restaurants. Fresh new looking restaurants helped to retain existing customers while attracting new ones. They also enhance our ability to introduce more premium offerings. Australia's recent success with the Angus Burger is a testament to that. We believe the timing for expanding our re\u2013imaging efforts is ideal, but simply together with our franchises, we are investing on a scale that cannot be matched. We plan to re\u2013image over 2000 locations this year. About half of those will be in Europe, another 600 in APMEA with the remaining 400 to 500 locations in the U.S. The opportunity to update our brand is significant. Globally, only about 20% of our exteriors reflect our current contemporary look. Approximately twice as many interiors, or about 40% has been updated. Therefore, the majority of our restaurants do not yet have a contemporary look on either the inside or the outside. In general, Europe is farther along than either in the U.S. or APMEA, particularly with interior re\u2013imaging. A combination of both, an exterior and interior re\u2013image produces the most significant sales lease, so that will be our plan going forward. In the U.S. the first 400 to 500 re\u2013image sites will tend to be older higher volume locations, where permitting time is reasonable and we either own the land or have significant lease term remaining. Geographically, we expect them to fairly disperse around the country with about 20 restaurants in each of our 22 regions, and in addition to our re\u2013imaging efforts, we will rebuild over 150 restaurants in the U.S. this year. We are co\u2013investing with our owner/operators on the re\u2013imaging effort in a similar manner as we have in the past. We expect our investment per restaurant will be in the range of $150,000 to $200,000 depending on the scope or the remodel. Our owner/operators will contribute the remaining $250,000 to $500,000. The total re\u2013imaging cost per restaurant will vary considerably depending on the age of the building, whether any previously updating has occurred, maintenance and repair needs and compliance with local zoning requirements such as interior sprinklers, lighting, signage and accessibility. We've seen an average sales lift above overall market performance of at least 6% to 7%. So, we expect returns from re\u2013imaging to be good for both the Company and our owner operators. Lastly, I would like to update you on currency translation. Our currency benefit came in at the low end of expectations that we provided on our call in January. Above the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro and the British Pound over the last two months, this was mostly offset by improved operating performance particularly in markets like Australia and Russia, where currencies remain more stable, and having approximately 45% of our total debt denominated in foreign currency also provides a hedge against volatility. Based on current exchange rate in business outlook, we expect the comparisons will begin to turn negative in the second half of the year, but for the full\u2013year, currency translation is expected to provide a slight benefit. We recognize this estimate becomes outdated within days, but at least to give you some perspective at today's rate. McDonald's first quarter numbers are a testament to the alignment of our system around growing both top and bottom line results in a challenging environment. McDonald continues to gain strength and looking ahead my experience this week with the franchises hear their owner/operator convention gives me more confidence that we can do even better as the economy improves. Thank you, now I will turn it over to Mary Kay to begin our Q&A.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks Pete. I will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). First question is from David Palmer at UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS: Thanks Mary Kay. Hi everybody. In the U.S. and Europe, how does traffic and the check breakdown \u2013\u2013 My gut is that checks was under pressure in the first quarter as it was for a lot of players out there, and maybe even that your traffic was above the same store sales number you did particularly in the U.S. and also that included in the sort of gut feeling is that you think that that check can improve through the year through kind of playing the trade up game against the trade down game last year and maybe even a little pricing as the year goes through. How does that thinking sound to you and any color would be helpful? Thanks.\nJim Skinner: Well good morning David. This is Jim. We have seen a little bit of a fall off in the check because of the way we've been presenting the menus to our consumers particularly around breakfast, but we do see some potential for this down, upside down the road. But you're right. We're not going to get through pricing. We're still holding the lining on pricing, but through some of our initiatives were on the menu. Many Don can talk a little about what that looks like.\nDon Thompson: Hey David. One of the things that's really great this year is we're seeing an even larger percentage of our sales growth, sales growth is really attributed to guest count growth and particularly to Jim's point, in markets such as the U.S. or Canada when you implement some of the breakfast value pieces that have been implemented, then those things will hit the average check a little bit more. However, the guest counts that we're diving are really tremendous and far exceed any kind of a breakeven. So, when we look at it overall we're really looking, finally I guess you would say as a guest count growth and that's what the focus is.\nJim Skinner: And David, specifically for Europe, guest count accounted for about 50% of the comp growth there. So we saw the balance as you heard in some of the remarks. We had a lot of success with premium products and more full margin products. So, we had a nice balance of check in, their traffic growth there in Europe.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from David Tarantino at Robert Baird.\nDavid Tarantino \u2013 Robert Baird: Hi, good morning and congratulations on a great start to the year. My question is on the U.S. business and in particular the acceleration in the comps in March in positive turn related to April. Do you think that the core QSR consumer is starting to feel a little bit better, or do you think that those results are being driven by some of your own sales drivers?\nJim Skinner: David, this is Jim. I think that the consumer is starting to feel a little bit better. If you see consumer confidence, score is getter better over the last couple of months. We see a little more spending in the market place and yet the stubborn unemployment being at 9.7% is still as a factor I think relative to that overall spending in that confidence. I don't believe that the spending levels are going to get back to pre\u2013recession until people have some confidence over the fact they are going to have a place to go to work and put food on the table at home or away from home. I think that's going to continue to be an issue, and I believe that the results that we are achieving are result of our strategies around the value orientation of our menu. It is absolutely continuing to be the most important thing relative to our customers, and that is everyday affordability and yet of course we continue to grow guest counts during this very difficult time, and have opportunity for them to partake of value across the menu even in our premium sandwiches. So, I think it's as much our strategies as it is the confidence of the QSR consumer.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian at Citi.\nGreg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi: Great, thanks. Just maybe a little bit on food cost deflation; kind of how that looks towards the back half of the year and does that give you a little bit more maybe ammunition to be a little bit more aggressive on value to drive all your guest counts?\nPete Bensen: Yes, Greg. As we look at how commodities are going to shake out for us been move throughout the year, specifically here in the U.S.?\nGreg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi: Yes.\nPete Bensen: It's a pretty favorable environment for us. We've probably seen the best quarter of the year in terms of experience here in the first quarter, but we think we're going to continue to see a favorable environment as we move throughout the year and as you mentioned, that's going to allow us to stay a little bit on the sidelines from a pricing perspective while others may not be as situated as we are with the strategies we have in place to mitigate some of those commodity costs, and then it may feel a little more pressure to have to go to the menu board. We feel pretty comfortable where we're at and our ability to focus on growing the guest counts, even delivered pretty good margins in that environment.\nDon Thompson: Greg, this is Don. The other thing to Pete's point, we didn\u2019t wait until the commodities had continued to decline. We implemented breakfast value in the U.S. earlier, McSnack Wrap early to beep up the mid\u2013tier and we did those things also at the same time that we had implemented the Angus burger for margin and profitability last year and now Frappes and Smoothies coming forward. So we've had a good mix relative to bringing in the guest counts and then trying to take advantage of that relative to some additional margin growth.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you, the next question is from Jeff Omohundro at Wells Fargo.\nJeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo: Thanks. My question is about Asia Pacific and maybe a little bit of an elaboration on the convenience initiatives being pursued there such as delivery and an update on the drive through utilization and outlook in China and perhaps a little bit on the Sinopec relationship? Thanks.\nJim Skinner: Yes. Jeff, Don just back from Asia. So, he is our resident expert on what they are doing over there.\nDon Thompson: Hi Jeff. The actually great, great visit to I was in China, Japan here recently, specific to drive through and actually I'll talk a little broader about the development strategy in China first. The one thing that that we are really focused on to your point is beginning to expand drive through, but I think we are learning how to do it even more effectively and being able to develop drive through in the outer range as we call it, where you have a little less density and you have a little bit more car traffic coming into the more urban areas and so the drive through part of that focus is great, big focus around the transportation hubs there, tremendous amount of density and the potential growth to continue to grow the business, and so the combination of those two things really are major part of our strategy and also the building to more free standing restaurants. So, in China, great strategy, we beeped our infrastructure. We are driving stronger margin. We are running better restaurant, some of the lowest customer satisfaction opportunities that we have within the system, which means really great operations and so all of those things are helping us in China and the drive through strategy is continuing. There will be a big growth target for us in China.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay. Thanks. The next question is from Joe Buckley from BofA\\Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley \u2013 BofA\\Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I want to ask one follow\u2013up to the March question and then kind of a related U.S question going forward. The acceleration of March, can you break that down for us a bit? Did you pick up a little bit of check in March or was check still down and how do the dayparts look and how sustainable does that feel to you in the March pickup. And then somewhat related going forward, just an update on the smoothies. It sounds like the frappes are almost done. Will the smoothies be up and running in time for the international advertising over the summer?\nPete Bensen: Hey Joe its Pete. I'll talk about March a little bit and then Don will talk about the extension in the McCaf\u00e9 beverages. March was a real good month for us. We saw sales and guest count growth across all dayparts. That was for the entire month of March and as we mentioned in the remarks, momentum is continuing into April. So we feel pretty good about where we're at and it wasn\u2019t just one or two things. It was broad based across the items that Jim mentioned and specifically, having frappes in 90% of the system by now is certainly a part of it and Don can probably elaborate on the frappes and smoothies.\nDon Thompson: Hey Joe. Right now frappes, we've got them in about 9,000 restaurants and the performance expectations at this point are greater than what we would have thought. The reality of it is we're at unit levels now that we felt we'd see once we actually started the marketing and we haven\u2019t started the marketing launch yet. So frappes are performing well and to your point on smoothies, whether or not we'd be ready for the advertising, yes we will. We've already got smoothies in over 2000 restaurants in the U.S. and so those are performing exceptionally well. This morning, Jim mentioned, we were at the worldwide convention. We had a chance to hear from some of our owner/operators who are executing the smoothies and interestingly enough in Michigan and really out performing based upon their execution in the restaurant and so a lot of excitement in the operator community and we're moving forward very effectively in terms of getting those products into the restaurants.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jason West at Deutsche Bank.\nJason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Yes. Thanks guys. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the commodity side of things and I'm really more focused on how do you guys manage the costs down so much when we're seeing some inflation across a lot of the proteins and is it something, I think you mentioned something you do differently from competitors. Can you talk a little bit about what that is and how that gives you a pricing advantage over time? That would be great. Thanks.\nPete Bensen: Yes, Jason. We've got an outstanding group of folks that work in our supply chain at McDonald's. They work with some of our risk management people and ultimately though its our independent suppliers that end up making these final decisions but they \u2013\u2013 we do a combination of things. We do some fixed price contracts after looking at markets and trying to anticipate what's going to happen, do some forward buying, some auctions and really through some of the long\u2013term relationships are able to negotiate some pretty favorable pricing and its all about for us trying to provide some stability and predictability in the prices. It's important to be able to go to owner/operators and talk about what promotions we're going to be running six or nine months from now and have them feel confident that they have some idea of what the cost of those items are going to be. So, in times like this when you're starting to see maybe the commodity markets take off a little bit, these tactics allow us to mitigate the impact on our margins and our commodity costs. And again there is no one item in our basket of goods that\u2019s more than 15% of our cost of sales. So its spread amongst a broad base of items where we have the opportunity to be as opportunistic as we can.\nDon Thompson: You know Jason, in our restaurant level too from an execution perspective, what we decide to promote, it plays a big role. So we've got great value in the restaurants but the ability to again sell an Angus product helps us also in terms of minimizing overall food impact. The product mix does help in Europe, whether it\u2019s the larger lay hamburgers, Reston, Austria, Germany. So we've got some higher margin products as well that support us relative to overall food costs.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from John Glass at Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: About the remodel costs, Pete you had thrown out a range, I think if I added correctly between $400,000 and $700,000 and I previously heard $400,000. So it seems like it\u2019s a wider range perhaps. Does that mean the average is in the middle or you think its more at the lower end but your just providing an upper end in special cases and I guess can you talk about the sales lift compared to the prior remodels? It would seem that if the sales lift was about the same in prior remodels but the cost was higher so the returns would be lower, if you can just check me on that. And I can't leave the March comp question alone. You said April was better than the first quarter. Is April also better than March?\nPete Bensen: All right John, I\u2019m seriously writing down all your questions here. Let me talk about the remodels a little bit. This is the first time that we've officially given guidance on what those costs are going to be. I know there has been some estimates out there and stuff but the range, we wanted to get across the point that there isn\u2019t going to be -- it's going to be hard to come up with an average remodel when you look across 6,000 restaurants in the U.S. system, varying ages, varying sizes and individual owner/operator decisions that they make in terms of what they want to invest in. So there is going to be the specific items that we know are going to really enhance the brand and there can be other items that an operator may take the opportunity to invest in at the time. So, I was visiting with some owner/operators about a month ago and while they were doing the remodel of both the interior and the exterior, they chose to do a replacement of their HVAC and to basically redo their whole parking lot instead of just reseal it because they knew that was coming up in a couple of years anyway and they take the opportunity to do it right now. So, you are going to see a wide range of spending, but ideally I would like to say the average would be in the middle but that's really hard to say. When you look at the sales lift from these, the fact that we do the combination of the interior and the exterior, we're getting a bigger sales lift than if we just did the interior and this is a lift if you think about the environment we're in John. Sales are strong and we're getting a lift above the general market in addition to that. So, as we look at it and pencil it out, even at some of the higher ends of our contributions and the lower end of the sales increases, we're seeing returns in the low double digits as the first year cash\u2013on\u2013cash return that we know will grow from there. So, we feel pretty confident about that and that the level of investment and the sales expectations will warrant this level of investment. For April, what we said in the release was that we expect April to be at least as strong as the quarter on a global basis. So what we're setting there is a floor saying that it won't be any lower than 4.2 is what our expectation is.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays: Great. Thank you. Actually just one follow\u2013up question on the U.S and then a separate question. I know you talked about breakfast during your prepared remarks and specifically the dollar menu. I was wondering if you can give a little bit more or whatever color you can give in terms of the mix of the dollar menu, whether it's as a percentage of total breakfast or otherwise, perhaps the impact on margins and what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint. And then separately just in terms of returning cash to shareholders, it looks like $1 billion in the first quarter. I\u2019m just wondering whether you could talk about, I feel like in the past the refranchising with the Smith and contributing to that cash flow. Should we expect that mix to continue to move from the 80% and 90% or might we think about potential leverage for share purchase and obviously to pay down existing near term debt? Thanks.\nPete Bensen: Jeffery, I'll just start with the return to shareholders and the franchising relationship. We're at 80% now relative to stores in the hands of the franchisees. Our formal process around that 1,500 we talked to about over three years is basically done and I really don\u2019t see for example us getting to the 90th percentile. I do believe though that where we're at now is kind of where you see it will settle out over time. But what we are doing is we're optimizing the ownership portfolio in every market around the world to make sure that we have that rate relative to our system and how we perform best in our business model and then the shareholder return issue is secondary to that. And then Don, perhaps you can talk a little bit about Jeff's other question.\nDon Thompson: Hi Jeff. Relative to breakfast and the mix in terms of what we're seeing, clearly we are selling more coffee and if you look at the products that are part of that dollar menu its basically a sausage biscuit, a sausage muffin. We've got hash browns in there and then you've got coffee. And then you've got the other products that were already on dollar menu such as a fruit and yogurt parfait. So when you look at it broadly, we're selling more coffee. We're selling more hash browns. We're selling clearly more sandwiches there. You are talking about sandwiches that have a relatively low food and paper cost. So the overall impact is not a large impact from a margin perspective as you can see from the margins that we were able to deliver. So all\u2013in\u2013all we're really pleased. The notion here was to really recapture guest counts and Jim mentioned this earlier. With unemployment at the level it is, our goal was to reach out and pull people out of homes and when you've got food at home still down 2% and you've got food away from home elevated at about 3.5%, we know we can't take a lot of price and so as a result of that, this breakfast menu has been helping us quite a bit to pull people back into the restaurant and we're really happy with the guest count what we're seeing at breakfast.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Speiser at Buckingham Research.\nMitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research: Thanks very much. Can you give us some metrics on the beverage mix? In particular, you've given us how coffee has performed overtime? In general, can you tell us where the beverage mix maybe for all beverages was, maybe three or four years ago, where it is today and maybe what you're thinking over the next couple of years and just separately I'm sure someone will bring it up, but just with the whole healthcare reform moving its way through, can you give us some numbers perhaps on how it might affect the McDonalds system on a corporate level and then perhaps on a franchisee level? Thank you.\nJim Skinner: Yes, thanks Mitch. This is Jim. I'll start with healthcare and then Don can fill you in on where we are with beverages. First of all as you all know, this is going to be implemented and mandated in 2014. So we've got a few years here to figure out what that direct impact might be to us. We're a federation of small businesses as franchisees as you all know, as I just mentioned and the impacts are going to vary across those franchisees. There are so many moving parts now. When you do the math its difficult to figure out exactly where it might settle because we're just into the implementation process now. It will vary by the number of employees that are full time for each franchisee. And then the bill of course, we have some things in it that have been beneficial for us, where there's a 90 day waiting period before our employers are required to enroll employees which is very important for us because sometimes it takes 90 days for us to realize whether or not a person is going to be a full time employee for us or whether they wouldn't be a full time employee for us. So that will be helpful in the overall invitation. And yet we have taken a shot at the math like a lot of other people and we think in the U.S it might be $10,000 to $30,000 per store. So it will be determined. We don\u2019t really have it sorted out yet. I don\u2019t think anybody really does. Relative to the corporate level, there is really going to be minimal impact for us. You've seen other companies come on who have legacy costs because of retiring health benefits. We don\u2019t have that problem. We have about 100 retirees that are in our program. They pay full premium including prescription rebates and so we don\u2019t have that legacy problem and therefore you wont be seeing any negative impact relative to the overall corporate coffers if you will relative to our overall situation, which is a very good thing. We really are structured in a way with our 401(k)s and our profit sharing and all the other kinds of things. We don't have any of those legacy issues that many companies have and we're very fortunate.\nDon Thompson: On the other question, just relative to coffee and how it's performing? Just a few things. When we started this back a while ago, our share in coffee was really low as you all know and if you looked at an overall share of coffee, we were somewhere around 2% overall. That is more than triple and if you just really broke it down, in terms of brew coffee, we now sell more brew coffee than anyone. That number has been a large growth opportunity for us. If you look at Espresso base, clearly we've more than doubled since the first part of just 2009. We've doubled our espresso base coffees and then clearly in the ice coffee arena, we've had tremendous growth there as well. So, all of the coffee strategies have been intended to really bring in more customers. We talked earlier about the incremental nature of it and about 40 odd percentile of the customers being incremental. That still holds true even as we move into frappes, which is still a coffee based, espresso based drink. So, all of our measures and metrics in terms of coffee have moved in a positive direction substantially.\nPete Bensen: And Mitch, the other nice thing about the beverage strategy and specifically with the frappes and the smoothies that are rolling out, only about 25% of the frappes are sold at breakfast time and about 15% of the smoothies. So, it fits nicely with filling other dayparts when we are trying to drive some traffic into the restaurant.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thanks. The next question is from Keith Siegner, Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse: Thanks. Just had a question on Japan. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more details maybe on the profitability of the stores that are going to be closed over the next year and changed. Maybe if there was any impact of the store closures on the equity income this quarter and any guidance or color you could give us on how we think about the contribution from Japan to equity income assuming all these doors were closed. Any details around figuring that would be very helpful. Thanks.\nPete Bensen: Yes, Keith, it's Pete. Within the equity pickup line there was no real impact from the closures. So I think about 30 restaurants really got closed this quarter of the ones that were announced and while they were of a lower volume and lower return than the average in the market, just getting 30 of them closed this quarter really didn\u2019t have a significant impact. And really as we go forward, we don\u2019t think there is going to be a tremendous impact on the equity and earnings. They weren\u2019t a significant drag. We'll have some, what we call sales transfer as we close these restaurants. So other restaurants in the market will pick up sales and those are the higher performing operations. So we'll see a slight benefit in our earnings from the ongoing operations there in Japan. But the real benefit of doing that was we had these group of restaurants that were constrained for future growth. They weren\u2019t really representative of where the Japanese team wanted to take the brand in the future and so its really more positive going forward about the state in the group of restaurants that we have which ultimately leads to better operating results and performance.\nDon Thompson: Keith, this is Don. I just over in Japan a couple of weeks ago and if you looked at these restaurants, the restaurants were to Pete's point really, really size and physical space constrained. So we couldn\u2019t even put full menus in there. So when we look at being able to, last year we shot a Quarter Pounder across the marketplace. It was really a challenge for us to get the operating platforms beefed up enough so to speak to be able to sell Quarter Pounders and so what we're trying to do is close down some of these that were opened up a lot of these street front type retail, high street type sites that were really not benefiting us at all from an income perspective and we just had a bunch of them that we opened over a short period of time back in the early 2000's and so that's really the goal here, close those down. I will tell you this. On April 25th, we are reopening about 13 restaurants in Tokyo. We're going to open on all of them on the exact same day. They will be the re\u2013imaged restaurants that are going to be very iconic in Japan and that is the future of where we want to go there. We're really excited about it. The Japanese team is excited and we will see that market begin to turn in an even more positive way as a result of what we're doing with development. But we've got to get rid of some of these older constraints within our system.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Miller, RBC.\nLarry Miller \u2013 RBC: Yes. Thanks. I just had a quick follow\u2013up, first on the re\u2013imaging. I think you said you're going to invest $150,000 to $200,000 total. Two things, is that similar structure like the prior investment, i.e, you get paid back either way. Can you talk about that and then will there be as you co\u2013invest, just remind me how it impacts franchise margin? And then I had two quick questions. As you are implementing a lot of these new programs, Don can you talk about anything you're noticing in speed of service and then finally maybe you guys could just discuss in general, the discounting levels that you're seeing today and how they compare with maybe 6, 12 months ago and what you think or at least your best guess what that might look like going forward and then theoretically why would you push your franchises to let up or the whole system and maybe this is more generally to the industry, why would anybody push their franchisees to let up on discounting when you can argue its driving traffic or defending traffic and really those guys bear the margin risks. So if you can talk about that in terms. Thanks.\nDon Thompson: All right Larry. I'll give it a shot. We have people working feverishly over here to capture all of that but on the first one, investment level, you asked about the older program versus the newest one. Here is the difference. Before what we did was we had a fixed amount, $85,000 that we contributed toward a re\u2013image when we did the whole re\u2013imaging program. What ended up happening was the franchisees actually invested. We thought the investment would be somewhere around $170,000. To the point that was made earlier and Pete made it, the franchisees ended up spending about $250,000 because they saw other things they wanted to invest in. This time this is not a $6 investment. What we're looking at now is somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 percentile of leasehold improvement. So we're talking physical plant type improvements in the restaurant. Now the reason we're able to do that this time is because we already did have a re\u2013imaging program for the interiors before. If a franchisee did not benefit from that then this time they're going to have to put forth some dollars to be able to do the interior of the restaurant and we have a very small contribution there. But the gist of this is the leasehold improvement and so that\u2019s the different between the older program and the newer one. The other thing is and Pete mentioned it but we should reiterate it again, this time there is a broad range. Some restaurants only need to do the exterior. Others will want to do a full interior exterior, the core package change, signage and M&R around equipment. That\u2019s why you see such a broad range. So, very different investment profile on our end. The next one, speed of service wise, we have not seen speed of service hindrances and the reason we haven\u2019t is if you look at when we implemented the combine beverage solution, the biggest part of that, about 80% of our restaurants did we called a full remodel of the beverage sale. What that meant was that they actually put in a built in additional capacity and a drive through. We had additional equipment. We had better spacing in the drive through. We went from five foot, three boots way out over nine feet in many cases and so when you look at what we did in drive through, we built in additional capacity. So, for some of the products we have now, its really flowing well in the restaurants. We have not seen a decrease in service. As a matter of fact in the U.S. they just posted their best quality, service and cleanliness scores for the month of March historically. So, we're doing real well on that end. Discounting level, we don't really look at this as a discounting level and the reason is because we have consistent value across the year is the reason for breakfast value menu, dollar menu, consistent value across the year which allows us then having set that up in the minds of our customers, they know its consistent. Now we can come in with our promotional activity and talk about frappes or smoothie or Angus. It's really important for us. So we're not jumping in and out of quote\u2013unquote discounting. We have a consistent value message across the year.\nPete Bensen: Hi, Larry, one other point is the impact of the re\u2013imaging. So our co\u2013investing with our franchises because as Don mentioned those are going to be leasehold improvements. Where you see that show up, it will be in additional depreciation on the franchise margin line.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you. The next question is from Steve West, Stifel Nicolaus.\nMatt Van Vliet \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Yes. Hi, it's actually Matt Van Vliet on for Steve, but I had a question on the status of the McCaf\u00e9 expansion in Europe and if you're still seeing the same pretty strong sales lifts of those units as that goes in. So just any color on that would be great.\nJim Skinner: Pretty much I think. Right now Germany has a tremendous amount of McCaf\u00e9's that have built down in Europe. Our sales performance there is strong. We are containing the McCaf\u00e9 build out. France has quite a few McCaf\u00e9's built out. Also France as you know has a tremendous amount of our restaurants that have been re\u2013imaged from an interior perspective and now France is doing the exterior in 2010. The rest of Europe, as we continue to move forward with both interior and exterior re\u2013images were appropriate. We will look at the McCaf\u00e9 expansion as well. McCaf\u00e9 is a different occasion in Europe than it is in the U.S. It is a sit down based occasion whereas in the U.S. we're able to executive this through drive through and at the front counter, and so we have even more drive through traffic that are benefiting from espresso based drinks in the U.S. than we do in Europe.\nMary Kay Shaw: The next question is from Howard Penny, Hedgeye Risk Management.\nHoward Penney \u2013 Hedgeye Risk Management: Thanks very much. As I think back on the seven year run that you've had in (inaudible) decision to back when you sourced it to trying to win was to sort of get back to the core McDonald's and focus on what you do well and over the years we've heard about McGriddles and Snack Wraps with Coffee and now Frappes and all the beverages that you're doing. How do you guard against some of the histories, some the past mistakes that you've made in the past where menu preparation has completely or not completely increased the complexity of the back of the house than the execution of the core business and we don't happen to run into what we saw about seven or eight years ago?\nJim Skinner: Well thanks for the question Howard. This is Jim. We stay focused on the future. It's mostly how we manage that and our processes today around the food development protocols and the design studios for food and food news, and food relevance and our innovation labs is a very, very deliberate process with a larger test cell than we've ever had in the history of our company and we don't move forward with anything that is not fully deliberated and collaborated with our franchise is relative to the operating side of the business in their restaurants and we are continued to be aggressive around the development of menu and wouldn't expect that will see any failures along the way.\nPete Bensen: Howard, when Jim and Jim helped us relative to giving us some focus relative to plan and win, one of the things that we first started doing was really reinvesting in the infrastructure and I think there is a big part of that that gets mixed. It's not just about the new products. At one point, we will roll new products without the reinvestment in the infrastructure. So, bridge operating platform in Europe made for you in the U.S. made for you expanding around the globe throughout Japan now. So, when you look at all of those things from an operating platform, they enabled us to better execute when we have additional menu items. The other thing that we are doing is clearly we are much more focused on our ops execution scores, and you inspect what you expect. And as we focus on execution of operations, we have we got much, much better and our customers are telling this day. So all of these kinds of things and making sure that we are not getting ahead of ourselves in marketing and promoting then we have a capability for in terms of operations. The other things that have helped us to execute, but that plan that we have focused that Jim and Jim helped us to fortify in back in the early 2000s is what's helping us today.\nMary Kay Shaw: Okay, great, looks like we are out of questions. So, thanks I'll go ahead and turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.\nJim Skinner: Well, thanks everybody for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to emphasize the continued strength of our global business and reiterate my confidence in our system. Our plan to win is delivering significant sustainable success. These latest results mark our 27th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. As I have experienced at this weeks Convention, our alignment and plans to deliver a great experience for our customers well into the future is strong and clear. With our entire system aligned and focused I'm confident that we'll continue to satisfy and delight our 60 million customers every day and I'm confident that our best is still yet to come for our system and our shareholders. Thank you so much.\nMary Kay Shaw: Thank you."}], "2012": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2011, "date": "2012-01-24 18:20:06", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin -  James A.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. With me on the call are our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner; Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen; and Chief Operating Officer, Don Thompson. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments, and both documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with our corresponding GAAP measures.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim.\nJames A. Skinner: Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong fourth quarter and another strong year for McDonald's in 2011. System-wide sales increased 7% in constant currencies, with global comparable sales up 5.6%, marking our eighth consecutive year of positive comp sales growth in every area of the world.  We closed the year on a high note with fourth quarter comp sales up 7.5%, the highest quarter in over 7 years, and December comp sales at 9.6%, reflecting positive momentum and a weather benefit in Europe and the U.S. This momentum continues as we begin 2012, with global comparable sales for January expected to be up 5.5% to 6.5%.  In constant currencies, operating income grew 14% for the quarter and 10% for the year, while EPS increased 15% for the quarter and 11% for the year. Over the past year, we again exceeded our long-term financial targets of 3% to 5% sales growth, 6% to 7% operating income growth and returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. And while returns are not yet finalized, we will be well above that target. And with a 35% total return for investors, McDonald's was the #1 performing company on the Dow for the 1- and 5-year periods ending in 2011. The global economy remains challenging with a recovery that's predicted to be slow and prolonged, and our industry still faces significant headwinds, including flat to slow growth, low consumer confidence and volatile commodity prices. Amid all this, we remain committed to the Plan to Win and elevating our efforts around the 5 Ps of our business: people, products, place, price and promotion. We still have plenty of growth through the Plan to Win, and we're seizing those opportunities with a focus on our global priorities of optimizing the menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening the accessibility to our brand. We're committed to building our brand in this holistic and comprehensive way. It's an approach that continues to drive our success around the world. Looking at the United States, comp sales increased 7.1% for the quarter and 4.8% for the year, with operating income up 15% and 6%, respectively. These results were achieved despite a tough economy, and we continued to grow market share and guest counts during a period when overall industry traffic was contracting. Our performance in the U.S. was driven by a focus on our value, menu relevance and convenience. We continue to benefit from our Dollar Menu at breakfast, which has been in place for over 2 years now and has fortified our leadership position in breakfast, as well as our position as a value leader across the entire day. Our beverage platform is attracting even more customers with line extensions such as our seasonal Peppermint Mocha offering in December, which helped increase total McCaf\u00e9 specialty coffee units by nearly 20% over last year. And later this year, we'll be adding the Cherry Berry Chiller to the McCaf\u00e9 blended ice lineup. The U.S. also built sales by focusing on promotional food events and core menu with a national promotion of McRib and another highly successful MONOPOLY promotion, as well as a December promotion of Big Mac increasing units by 11% over last year. In 2012, we will leverage our success with line extensions and new flavors, as well as promotional food events, to build sales. In addition to the Cherry Berry Chiller, we will roll out Chicken McBites and will expend on last year's successful launch of oatmeal with the addition of blueberry banana nut oatmeal. We will also continue to feature our flagship core items: Big Mac, hamburger, cheeseburger, Chicken McNuggets and our world-famous French fries, all of which account for roughly 30% of our sales. U.S. is also building capacity improving convenience with more than 1,100 stores utilizing handheld order takers to help increase restaurant throughput. More than 1/3 of our freestanding restaurants now have some type of multiple ordering points, whether it's handheld order takers, inline tandem or side-by-side drive-thru. In 2012, we will continue to build capacity to handle more demand, as we know that most of our restaurants can increase throughput with successful labor and operation solutions that are already in the system today and need to be scaled. Turning to Europe, comparable sales were up 7.3% for the quarter and 5.9% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 12% for the quarter and 10% for the year. Europe was a big contributor to overall results, even as consumers felt the impact of austerity measures, the sovereign debt crisis and an overall volatile economy. Our big 3 markets of France, the U.K. and Germany, along with Russia, led the way by delivering stronger operating results for both the quarter and the year. We made gains in Europe through a focus on exciting menu news, particularly premium food events that resonated with customers. Germany featured several popular limited-time sandwiches, while the U.K. drove sales with promotional chicken offerings and France saw good results with a lineup of innovative hamburger bagel sandwiches. In addition, a continued focus on 2 of our popular new premium offerings, McWraps and the 1955 burger, helped increase sales. At the same time, Europe stayed committed to delivering compelling fourth-tier options and promoting everyday affordable pricing for consumers feeling the pressure in their local economies. In 2012, we will further enhance our relevance by adding another 150 McCaf\u00e9s to Europe's existing base of 1,500, while continuing to leverage popular fourth-tier and premium offerings, including a re-hit of the sandwiches Chicken Mythic in France and Chicken Legend in the U.K. Meanwhile, Europe's reimaging efforts will continue to be a key differentiator, providing our customers with a fresh, inviting and relevant experience. We plan to broaden that reach with 90% of interiors and 2/3 of exteriors reimaged by the end of 2012. And over the next 3 years, we will implement our updated POS ordering system, which enhances accuracy and service. As we continue our efforts in Europe, I'm confident that our strategies around modernization, value and menu will resonate with consumers and yield results for our business. Shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or APMEA, for the quarter and year, comp sales were up 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively. We delivered significant operating income growth of 19% for the quarter and 17% for the year in constant currencies. APMEA remained focused on building breakfast, providing exceptional affordability and convenience and delivering menu excitement and variety.  Breakfast continued to be the fastest-growing day part for many markets, including our big 3 markets of Australia, Japan and China. Compelling value at breakfast combined with a focus on our menu and coffee, as well as popular local offerings, including the tuna muffin in Japan and new muffin sandwiches in Australia, helped drive results. Australia also made gains with new menu news, including a successful launch of smoothies and frappes and a lineup of popular promotional items to celebrate its 40th anniversary. Across Malaysia, China and Japan, new varieties of chicken offerings also positively impacted the top line. In 2012, we will maintain our focus on new and innovative offerings around chicken, as well as locally relevant products such as chicken and beef sandwiches with bacon, lettuce and tomato in Australia and the return of our successful line of Big America burgers in Japan. Throughout APMEA, our value leadership remained a draw for customers. Value at lunch was a strong driver across the region, particularly in China, where our Value Lunch program has become a true brand differentiator. Driving sales and guest counts through that program has been very successful. It's also achieving results in Australia, which has experienced lagging consumer confidence as a result of the economic slowdown there. And APMEA's convenience initiatives around delivery, dessert kiosks and extended hours make our brand more accessible and easier for customers to use in the growing eating-out market. In 2012, we will continue to expand services like delivery in Asia and increase our extended hours across the region. Overall, we remain extremely excited by our progress and potential in APMEA, especially in China, where we opened a record 200 restaurants in 2011; and in Japan, which is recovering after the devastating tsunami there last March. With the delivery of another strong year, I'm confident in our business strategies and the opportunities for growth that lie ahead. And the headline is that we're staying on the move in 2012. As we begin the New Year, I want to reiterate our capital management philosophy. Our business delivers significant cash flow, and our philosophy for the use of cash remains unchanged. Our first priority remains reinvesting in our business. In 2011, we opened 1,150 new restaurants and reimaged 2,500. In 2012, we plan to spend $2.9 billion in capital to accelerate our development plans. Half of our planned capital expenditures will go toward opening more than 1,300 new restaurants in both emerging and mature markets. The remaining half will be invested in existing restaurants to help modernize the brand, predominantly through our reimaging effort, making our restaurants more modern and appealing for our customers. With about 45% of our interiors and 25% of our exteriors reimaged globally, we have tremendous opportunity to keep building on a proven initiative that increased both sales and brand scores. To that end, we're planning to reimage more than 2,400 restaurants in 2012. After reinvesting in the business, we are committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors. In 2011, we returned $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends. Overall, I'm proud of what we've accomplished in 2011 as a system. Our talented and committed owner/operators, suppliers and employees continued working together to make every experience great for our guests, which have now reached nearly 68 million a day. We continue to gain market share, attract more customers to our brand and fortify our financial strength. Our Plan to Win and the focus on the customer has been a proven strategy in any environment, and we continue to serve -- this plan will continue to serve us well in 2012 and beyond. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. As our fourth quarter and full-year performance demonstrates, McDonald's global business is resilient and fundamentally strong, operating effectively across varying markets and economic conditions. Our ability to continue to generate positive comparable sales, combined with prudent expense control amidst an inflationary environment, drove a 60-basis-point improvement in combined operating margin for the year, with every area of the world contributing. At 31.6%, our operating margin compares quite favorably to other large, global consumer companies. Turning to restaurant-level margins. Our global system is 81% franchise, and our overall profitability is driven primarily by franchise margins. For the full year, consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 9% in constant currency to $7.2 billion. The consolidated franchise margin percent, driven by solid comparable sales growth in each area of the world, rose 70 basis points to 83.1% for the quarter and increased 60 basis points to 83% for the full year. For a perspective, that 83% is our highest annual franchise margin since 1993. Consolidated company-operated margin dollars increased $66 million for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, margins declined 30 basis points to 18.7% for the quarter and flipped 70 basis points for the full year, as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher cost, most significantly commodities, across all segments. Considering the significant cost pressure and economic volatility we experienced this year, I'm pleased to end the year with a consolidated margin of 18.9%.  Menu pricing has a significant impact on margins, and our philosophy remains intact as we start 2012. Where warranted, we will strategically take increases to offset some, but not all, of our higher costs. Maintaining traffic growth has been such a critical element of our recent success, so we remain focused on a balanced approach to growing traffic and average check at our restaurants, while being mindful of store-level margins. Looking at segment performance, the U.S. once again delivered strong comparable sales growth in both the quarter and full year by remaining focused on the customer. Our 2011 comp increase of 4.8% was the highest since 2006. Amidst an IEO market that saw a traffic decline of 0.3% through November, McDonald's continued to outpace the competition and grew market share by 50 basis points to reach an all-time high of 12.5%. This translated into over 350 million additional customer visits compared to 2010. Several factors contributed to this success, including introducing relevant new products like Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and Mango Pineapple Smoothies; promoting iconic products such as the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets and the ever-popular McRib; optimizing our menu by evolving product offerings in key categories such as premium chicken sandwiches; broadening accessibility through extended hours, now nearly 40% of our restaurants are open 24/7, and 89% open by 5:00 a.m.; and also modernizing the customer experience with contemporary, new, rebuilt and reimaged restaurants. For the quarter, U.S. company-operated margins grew 40 basis points to 21%, as comparable sales growth of 7.1% more than offset 4% higher commodities and other cost increases. For the full year, company-operated margins declined 70 basis points to 20.6%, still an impressive level considering the environment. As we look to 2012, we continue to project commodity cost increases of 4.5% to 5.5% in the U.S., with increases above this range expected in the first half of the year, particularly first quarter.  From a pricing standpoint, we begin the year in the U.S. with a 3% increase over the last 12 months. This is the result of taking small increases throughout 2011, the most recent being in November when we took an increase of less than 1%. Our total increase for the year approximated food-away-from-home inflation, while food-at-home inflation was about 6%. Looking to 2012, we will continue to monitor both indices closely to maintain our strong value proposition. Europe's positive momentum continued in 2011 with strong comparable sales growth. Our restaurants in Europe are some of the best representations of our brand, with about 80% of the interiors and nearly half of our exteriors reflecting a current, contemporary look. This has allowed us to stretch our brand as reimaged locations attract new customers and invite existing customers to visit us more often. Menu innovation, including premium products as well as locally-relevant fourth-tier items, contributed to the success in the U.K., France, Germany, Russia and all of our 35 other European markets. Strong comparable sales helped to offset a significant portion of the higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs that we experienced in Europe. Fourth quarter company-operated margins declined 30 basis points to 19.2%, due in part to 6% higher commodity costs. For the year, company-operated margins were down 50 basis points to 19.3%. Europe's commodity inflation is expected to moderate a bit in 2012 with a projected increase of 2.5% to 3.5%. Similar to the U.S., the most significant pressure will be felt in the first half of the year. The overall increase is expected to be less than the U.S., primarily because of more favorable prices for beef and packaging. In terms of pricing in 2011, Europe averaged a 2% increase, excluding Russia, which is experiencing significantly higher inflation. This year, with lower commodity cost increases and continued economic volatility, we will again likely see lower menu price increases, excluding Russia, compared to the U.S. Adding to the economic volatility in Europe are the various austerity measures being implemented. VAT increases in France, Portugal and Hungary, as well as other austerity measures, are impacting customers' purchasing power and challenging our margins through higher social charges and new taxes. In addition, high levels of unemployment are projected to continue for the foreseeable future. All of these factors, compounded by the euro zone debt crisis, are taking a toll on consumer confidence, which hit a 2-year low in December. Despite this backdrop, our European business remained strong. We have the right people and plans in place to grow our business in 2012 and beyond. The results achieved since 2008 give us confidence in our ability to continue to successfully navigate through these current conditions. Turning to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, virtually every country posted positive comparable sales for the quarter and full year, including Japan, no small feat considering the tragedy that occurred in March and the subsequent challenges. I believe it speaks to the resiliency and commitment of our system to be there for our customers, especially in times of great need. Several markets in APMEA, including Japan, China and Australia, delivered exceptional value at breakfast and lunch, making McDonald's more affordable, more often. Menu news is also playing an important role in driving top line sales through limited-time offers and relevant new product launches. Relative to profitability, APMEA's company-operated margin was down 80 basis points for the quarter at 16.3%, as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. For the year, company-operated margins declined 50 basis points to 17.3%. New store growth in China negatively impacted our margins, but we believe this impact is temporary and remain very bullish about the long-term potential of this market. Regarding G&A, in constant currency, consolidated G&A decreased 1% for the quarter and was flat for the year. This was a little higher than our initial expectations, primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation resulting from the strong fourth quarter performance. We project 2012 G&A to increase about 6% in constant currencies due in part to the 3 items discussed at our November investor meeting, the first being the technology enhancements across several markets to extend restaurant capabilities and upgrade our HR and financial systems. The other 2 significant noncomparable items are the costs associated with the second quarter biennial owner/operator convention and the third quarter London Olympic and Paralympic Games. Next, I'd like to comment briefly on our tax rate, which we expect to be between 31% and 33% for 2012. In 2011, our effective tax rate benefited from a couple of noncash deferred tax adjustments that will not repeat this year, resulting in a slightly higher 2012 range. Bear in mind that our global effective tax rate is impacted by a multitude of factors in the countries where we operate, as well as any potential legislation that could affect the rate in a given year. Our proven ability to increase sales, generate strong margins and control spending, all within a heavily franchised model, combined to generate significant cash flow. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business. We believe now is an opportune time to strategically increase new store openings while continuing a significant focus on reimaging. We have the financial capacity and talent to invest when many others cannot. This is a competitive advantage that we intend to leverage to further differentiate the McDonald's experience. As Jim discussed, about half of our $2.9 billion of CapEx will be used to open more than 1,300 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings at our largest geographic segments is as follows: 175 in the U.S.; 250 in Europe; and 750 in APMEA, including 225 to 250 new restaurants in China. The other half of our CapEx will be invested in our existing locations, including reimaging at least 2,400 restaurants. In November, we indicated that the U.S. would likely exceed 600 reimages by the end of 2011. I am pleased to report that over 900 U.S. restaurants were reimaged last year. This underscores the strong commitment and financial ability of our franchisees to invest to enhance the image and operational efficiencies of their restaurants. For 2012, we expect the U.S. to reimage 800 restaurants, while Europe expects to reimage about 900 and APMEA about 475. Reimaging is a key component of modernizing the customer experience, as it provides a strong foundation for future growth and further brand differentiation. Lastly, I'd like to touch on foreign currency translation, which remarkably did not affect fourth quarter EPS but benefited full-year EPS by $0.19. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2012 EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.02 to $0.03. The projected negative impact is more pronounced in second and third quarters, with a full-year negative impact of $0.16 to $0.18, 2/3 of which is being driven by the weaker euro. Remember, these are projections at today's rates and will likely change as we move through the year. As we begin 2012, I am confident in the strategies and plans that we have in place. We enjoy a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value; a strong financial position that allows us to seize the opportunities in front of us; and franchisees, suppliers and company employees who are aligned and committed to further widening our competitive advantage. We remain focused on continuing to profitably grow market share and drive value for our shareholders and the global system in 2012 and beyond.  Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin the Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Pete. I'm going to now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about the U.S. specifically, which, on a 2-year basis, accelerated to the highest level in years, so that equivalized [ph] for any of the weather impact. And I wanted to understand more about what you perceive to be the primary drivers. And the reason I ask is, in my opinion, the 2012 MPT [ph] pipeline seems maybe a little lighter than last few years. And I'm curious if you think you could sustain the high level you've established mostly based on the core. Or secondarily, as part of this question, is there maybe something in the pipeline that's more meaningful for the back half of the year, 2013 maybe, that you're internally excited about and not just -- you're not talking about yet?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, Michael, this is Jim, and then maybe Don would like to talk about the U.S. business in terms of the pipeline. But I think the answer to your question is yes, we do believe we can sustain our growth with core being the fundamental driver of that, as I mentioned in my comments this morning. Core plays an enormous role in terms of our overall sales growth and the top line every year, not just in 2012, as it did in 2011. And you have to remember that some of these new menu items as well that we add on are not all 13th month yet from last year. And at the same time, we're continuing to add new menu items in the pipeline around the McCaf\u00e9 and other sandwich line items. And so I don't know if, Don, you want to talk -- and we have no visibility around the back half of 2013 just yet. Or if we do, no one's told me about it.\nDonald Thompson: Michael, in the U.S., several major drivers. One of which has been consistent over the last several years is breakfast, continues to drive the business, not just from a value component perspective but also even in some of the new product entr\u00e9es such as oatmeal. We continue to see leverage from some of the McCaf\u00e9-based beverages, even the blended ice beverages, which are spread across the day. So we get some lift from that. The whole notion of core that Jim mentioned is really big in the U.S., and not just Big Macs have played very, very well. But there's a lot of other basic things that the U.S. is doing. Expanding hours and continuing to extend that is something that's helping us out. The benefit that the U.S. has today relative to core or technology and the fact that we now have the restaurants up on a new POS platform is allowing us to be able to begin to address capacity, particularly at peak hours, in a stronger fashion. So those things, all of those components and several others are really helping the U.S. continue to drive. What the U.S. has not done as much yet, and we still have headroom, is some of the global pipeline also that Jim alluded to in terms of premium-based sandwiches from Europe, are still products that we have opportunities within the U.S. And I know the team is looking at that.\nKathy Martin: Our next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: A question on Europe. And, Pete, I know you mentioned all the issues and austerity measures and low consumer confidence in December, yet your comps ended the year on a high note. So I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on the underlying tone of business and whether you're starting to see any signs that the consumer is starting to pull back as you parse through your data, either in your internal data for McDonald's or as you look at the market conditions.\nJames A. Skinner: Yes, David, this is Jim. I'll just give you an overview from my vantage point. You've already talked about all the bad news in Europe, and certainly, there are a number of issues there that we have to deal with in terms of headwinds. But I think regarding the McDonald's brand, despite negative market momentum, McDonald's continues to show increases in both informal eating out and the QSR share. We continue to take share in those marketplaces. And sales have been solid. Our value, convenience and overall business model continues to serve us well there. We're positioned well with branded affordability, strategic menu price increases in premium products across the board in Europe. And as I've said many, many times, I think that our business model serves us well in any environment, as long as we propel ourselves through that time period with the proper level -- levers in our business. The most important thing right now around the world, and has been, really, if you look at it for the last 8 to 9 years, is everyday affordability on the menu, coupled with premium sandwiches and fourth-tier menu items in that marketplace that continue to serve us well, along with the reimaging. We've not stood still. So if you look at the contemporary nature of our brand in that market during what one could term a very, very difficult economic downturn, which we've had before in Europe -- this is not the first time we've gone through this -- McDonald's continues to push forward on behalf of the consumers in those marketplaces, and it continues to serve us well. Now relative to parsing the data, which is something that Pete would do, maybe he has some other information that might differ from my opinion.\nPeter J. Bensen: No. David, I think Jim gave a good overview. And in terms of looking at things like menu mix or product change, we're really seeing no change in customers' behavior. The premium food events and fourth-tier items continue to sell extremely well, and that happened throughout the fourth quarter.\nKathy Martin: Your next question is from David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A quick question on margin leverage at the restaurant level. Certainly, this was a year that the franchise revenues and the G&A and just your top line accelerating through the year with inflation and innovation, those were the big drivers. But company margins haven't been in the game here. Do you expect 2012 to be perhaps a year when your price catches up to inflation, particularly with the momentum you have, and you start to see more leverage at the company restaurant level?\nJames A. Skinner: David, this is Jim. Is that a pricing question? Or is that a...\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's a company -- are you going to just -- are we going to see margin leverage at company restaurants in 2012? But maybe directly, you're not going to answer that. I'm just wondering if the balance is going to improve because, I mean, certainly through the fourth quarter, we weren't seeing leverage on that part of your business yet, particularly in Europe.\nJames A. Skinner: I'll let Pete talk a little bit about the margin leverage.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes, David, specifically about Europe, as we head into 2012, based on the guidance we've given, so we expect commodity cost increases to be lower in Europe compared to 2011. Some of these incremental austerity measures, so the increased social charges and some of the other taxes that are hitting the restaurants, those are going to be -- while we'll have some new ones, the magnitude of those will be lower than we saw in 2011. On the negative, if you will, it's an uncertain pricing environment there. So while we mention these things that are happening to the consumer, we're still optimistic we'll be able to take some price. But when you throw all that in the hopper, I think on a trend basis, compared to 2011, we have an opportunity in Europe to finish this year better trend-wise than we did 2011. The U.S. looks more like a similar year to 2011, frankly. Cost increases are going to be similar. We're -- 7 states hit us with minimum wage increases here, January 1, in the range of 4% to 5%. And again, while we'll take a similar philosophy and approach to our pricing throughout the year, food at home is expected to be up 3% to 4% this year; food away from home, 2% to 3%. And those are kind of some guide rails we look at. So again, factoring all that in, it feels pretty similar. But on a consolidated basis, the margin trend should be a little better than it was in 2011. But I did point out specifically in my comments that it's going to be a little choppy in the quarters. And then the first quarter, we're going to see the highest increase in commodities for the year.\nKathy Martin: And next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Wanted to ask 2 things actually, the China same-store sales number for the quarter. And then sort of similar to the question about Europe, curious if you're seeing anything encouraging on the U.S. consumer's part in terms of this very strong U.S. performance. Any change in pattern or mix or anything of that sort?\nPeter J. Bensen: Joe, I'll take the China question and then Don can talk about the U.S. consumer. In the fourth quarter, comps in China were 15.6, with double-digit guest count growth as well. And that's on top of a mid-single-digit increase last year, fourth quarter.\nDonald Thompson: Joe, and on the U.S. consumer side, just from -- and I'll reference this from a purchase perspective in the U.S. They'll come with things we always look at in terms of trying to determine whether or not we see substantial consumer movement, one of which is daypart analyses. So as we look at dayparts like evenings and breakfast, do we see -- are we seeing more momentum in some of those dayparts which typically starts to -- if you correlate that with some of the unemployment numbers and some of the hired numbers, the new job numbers, it tends to help us a little bit. We see a little bit of movement. I mean, our evening dayparts were a pretty strong comp and breakfast has been a pretty strong comp for us. But it's still pretty early to tell. And Pete mentioned the word volatile. I think, in the U.S., we're still volatile. And so our value still appeals. But even in our value numbers, we've not seen our value numbers really change dramatically from a percent of sale perspective. So we know that the P mix [ph] is pretty solid. We do see some strength in evening dayparts and breakfast, but I think it's a little too early to tell whether or not this is a sustainable trend.\nKathy Martin: Our next question comes from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just 2 quick ones. I guess, first, if you could parse out the weather impact for us as you did last year in Europe and U.S. And then, any color on the timing of some of the new products that you've announced such as McBites or the oatmeal or maybe smoothies, internationally. I'm not sure where you guys stand on that timing.\nPeter J. Bensen: Jason, the weather impact, we talked about last year having like a 2-point impact in the U.S. and a 5-point impact in Europe in December. So that's basically what we overcame this year and what benefited this year's -- or 2011 December. Regarding new products, Don, you want to take a stab at that one?\nDonald Thompson: Kind of real quick across the board, in terms of new products we see on the beverage front, Australia just launched smoothies. And so we're taking a good read of that. They've got some pretty good volume on the first launch of that. We see some of the other premium sandwiches, particularly the wraps that started off in Austria and Poland -- those are really traveling around Europe quite aggressively. We see, also, the ability for us -- we're seeing a little bit more of some of the premium sandwiches that Europe has had also stretching into some of the Asia/Pacific, Middle East markets a little bit. Probably, the biggest of all of the menu pieces, I would say, is breakfast. Breakfast is beginning to circulate around the rest of the world. We're starting to see some changes. The U.K. is up to about 14% and Germany is at about 5%. So if you look at the U.S., relative to 25-plus percentile, you begin to say, \"Wow. There's some tremendous opportunity there.\" So we got a lot of room still in breakfast products, the premium sandwiches. Wraps are traveling. McBites are in the U.S. from Australia and smoothies and beverages are traveling around the world. So those things are going to continue. Not everyone is going to launch smoothies in 2012. It'll be kind of stretched out over several years around the world.\nPeter J. Bensen: Jason, specifically about the McBites, we launched that product nationally yesterday. So you'll start to see national advertising for that. And that's a limited time promotion that will be around for a couple of months.\nKathy Martin: And our next question is from Diane Geissler from CLSA.\nDiane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I'm not sure if you've covered this, but could you break down the drivers of the comp growth? Whether it was -- I think you talked about traffic being up, but was there pricing in there as well?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes, Diane. This is Pete. Specifically in the U.S. for the year, we had about a 3% price increase spread throughout 3 different price increases that we took. Europe, if you exclude Russia, which had pretty high inflation, we averaged about a 2% increase throughout the year. And in APMEA, across the various markets, again, various amounts and various timings, we averaged about a 4% increase.\nKathy Martin: Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.\nMatthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Pete, if you can help us just understand. In modeling out, looking at the other income line, I was under the impression that was maybe going to start to tail off. But looking at the components of it, I guess the equity line, or income from equity investments, looks like it's coming in a little stronger. And 1Q, obviously, with the tail end of that having the disaster in Japan, should we start looking for the other income line to be more reflective of what we saw in 2010 1Q rather than 1Q '11? And then sort of drawing into that as well, while we're over in APMEA, looking at your margins, you mentioned a little something about the store growth starting to weigh -- the China growth starting to weigh on the margins over there. Is that going -- but it might reverse. I was wondering, can you give us some color on why that would reverse? Or what are going to be the key drivers of that even though growth is going to be relatively strong still?\nPeter J. Bensen: All right, Matt. Other op is really a -- there are a lot of items impacting that. But you specifically talked about equity and earnings. A couple things this year, obviously, we had the stronger yen. So our -- that's an as-reported number that we put in there. So we were getting some FX benefit from the stronger yen. Yes, in the first quarter, I would expect our performance in Japan will be better than first quarter last year. But remember, the tsunami hit in March. So we had 2 pretty good months of performance already in Japan before that hit. So in total, in that line, I don't think it's dramatically different trend-wise. Regarding China, I didn't say it was going to reverse. What I said was that, that impact is temporary. And so what I'm getting to there is we had a large jump in non-comp stores this year relative to last year as we accelerated the new store openings. And yes, we're going to continue to increase new store openings. But as we do that, the comp store base is larger. So the impact of accelerated new stores on the total base will become less, and at the same time, those new stores should be coming on at higher volumes as the market averages grow. And therefore, the new-store impact should be moderating as well. So hopefully, that clarifies that comment.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just one clarification on Europe and then a separate question. Just specific to Europe, you mentioned not seeing any change in mix despite the austerity measures. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that was similar to the message you sent related to the U.S. over the past couple of years. Just wondering, when you think about Europe, do you think of it similar to the U.S. in terms of consumer behavior and use of the quick service offering? Or perhaps is the European offering more premium? And therefore, would there be any particular regions that are more or less susceptible, you would think, to the ongoing austerity measures? And then just as the aside, on the balance sheet, you obviously mentioned a strong financial positioning. I didn't know if there was any update on whether there's room for a leverage opportunity while maintaining your rating and returning more cash to the shareholders.\nDonald Thompson: Jeff, this is Don. I'll take the first part of that on mix due to austerity and then I'm sure Pete will take the next one on leverage. The challenge with Europe is there's not one -- as you all know, there's not one country called Europe. So it's very different across the various markets. And let me give you perspective. Spain's at 22% unemployment. Have we seen a shift in terms of P mix [ph] into Spain to more value-based products? Yes, we have. But what Europe's done a really great job of is also adding in the premium-level products. So we still get some balance, so that we're not tremendously eroding margins. If you go to some other markets, better yet the upcoming year with Portugal, Pete talked about some of the VAT increases. We expect we'll see the ability to have a stronger value presence as well as a mid-tier presence in a market like Portugal. On other extremes, a market like France, France has been able -- and Germany have been able to implement some premium-based sandwiches. And although the German consumer is a little tighter relative to the expenditures, products like -- and Jim talked about Hutengoutie [ph], big beef sandwiches. Those things can sell a little bit better in those type of markets. The U.K. has movement across all price tiers. So when we talk about whether or not the mix will be affected due to austerity, I think there's 2 different things. One is what we do in those markets relative to our marketing messages and our value offerings, that helps us to modify our mix just a little bit. The other thing is Europe has done a great job on the premium-based products. And so the 2 of those things have helped us to manage through margin pressures a bit. But in a broader sense, it's helped us in terms of generating income.\nPeter J. Bensen: And regarding leverage, Jeff, as we have the last couple years, our assumption for 2012 is that we will increase debt -- our debt levels. And our interest rate assumptions for 2012 assume a couple of different scenarios: one a more modest increase in debt, and one a little higher increase based on the range of business performance we see. And as you point out, all within the context of staying within the credit metrics and the credit ratings that we enjoy today.\nKathy Martin: And our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Pete, while I know you don't talk about earnings growth targets specifically, it seems that at the enterprise level, in 2012, there are number of items that in aggregate may create some drag. Those include the investment spending in SG&A, higher interest expense. We've got a higher tax rate now. It seems like it's hitting a new sort of higher level. Then of course, we've got things like foreign exchange and commodities, which are at least at U.S. -- levels in the U.S., experienced in '11. So I guess 2 questions for you. One, do you agree with that, that there may be a depressed level of earnings growth in '12 versus '11 given all -- the confluence of all those factors? Are there any offsets that you see that we're not seeing right now, so that maybe that's an incorrect assumption? And maybe can you also just talk about which of those features that I talked about are permanent? In other words, do you expect G&A spending beyond '12 to remain at these levels? Do you expect the tax rate beyond '12 to also remain at these levels?\nPeter J. Bensen: Well, John, one of the things we said at the investor conference was that despite these items that you mentioned, that we expect our earnings to be consistent with our long-term targets. And that's one of the things we've committed to and something we feel pretty confident about. The G&A, we indicated an incremental $100 million for the technology, the convention, the Olympics. And that kind of magnitude of growth, growth of that magnitude, we do not expect to continue. Currency is one of those things that we look at over time as being neutral. You're going to have positive years and negative years. That's why we like to look at our business x currency for our internal reporting. But obviously, it does impact our reported EPS. And the tax rate, I'm not sure that we've necessarily set a new high, but it's something we obviously continue to look at around the world, how we can minimize our tax rate. You may recall, 2 years ago, they took away a tax credit -- foreign tax credit that was providing a little more than 200 basis points of improvement to our rate. And we've been looking at opportunities to get some of that back, and I'm confident we'll be able to.\nDonald Thompson: John, this is Don. Just I think we have to keep in mind as well, we drove a lot of demand. 60-plus percent of our growth was due to increased demand in the restaurants. So while we talk about some of the limiting factors associated with cost or taxation, the thing that we continue to strive for is to make sure we continue to bring in additional customers into the restaurants. So when you see at U.S. with great guest count movement and sales, when you see Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa, China, even our Latin American markets with the high inflationary environments that they're in, continuing the growth guest counts -- as long as we can continue to do that and appeal with compelling offers, the top line portion of that -- and manage the margins effectively, we'll still be able to drive this business forward. And that's what we've been doing for the last several years.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Larry Miller, RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Jim, I think you mentioned one of the plans for the U.S. is to build capacity. And clearly, new POS is part of that. I'm not sure if there's other operational initiatives out there. But I was just wondering if you were -- or Don can talk about the order of magnitude of that opportunity. I guess, it's around speed of service.\nJames A. Skinner: Well, I wouldn't tell you exactly what the magnitude is. It varies by marketplace and by restaurant, of course. I think the important thing to understand is that increasing capacity, particularly during peak hours in our restaurants, is critical for us to be able to continue to grow guest counts and grow the top line. And we've done a number of things to facilitate that. You talked about the POS. We talked about multiple ordering points. But scheduling, planning and positioning, the blocking and tackling in the restaurant, with an attitude of serving more customers during those peak hours, is probably the most important thing. It's not rocket science. It takes the managers and crew being positioned properly, having enough staff there to take care of the demand that Don talked about. And it's been a mission at McDonald's, the 40 years that I've been here, to continue to do that better and better every year and every day. And so when you see us go from 64 million customers a day to 68 million customers a day, that throughput is coming from facilitation that I've just mentioned. And we're very excited about the number of things that we're able to bring to the party. But it's not all technology. A lot of it is simple things like proper scheduling, positioning and then planning for your shift, planning for that time period from 11 to 1, for example, to be able to facilitate faster service, and fast service begets more customers.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: You've talked a lot about some of the menu initiatives. I want to go back to a comment you made about breakfast, basically, just talking about what you can do in the stores as a comp driver. So could you either anecdotally or maybe more systematically talk about some of the things like the opportunity for, in Europe in particular, drive-thru, late-night, 24 hours. And then maybe in the U.S. and also in Europe, as you approach some of these fairly high rates of reimaging -- so 90% of interiors in Europe. You've accelerated in the U.S. -- how should we think about that? Is that a diminished benefit to comps? Because if you were -- reimages as a percentage of the store base? Or is it enhanced because of the kind of the critical mass that you always talked about?\nDonald Thompson: Sara, I'll try to take a cut at several things in there. Real quick on the U.S. relative to reimaging, I mean, if you really think about it, we're just getting started. We were able to do a couple of hundred in 2010 and then 900-plus in 2011. We have a lot of opportunities still left. And the returns that we're seeing, as we've talked about to you guys, have been very strong. Relative to some of those other things -- and I just call it multiple drivers. So in Europe, drive-thru. So 63% of the restaurants that have drive-thrus, about 46% of sales in those restaurants. That's only 30%. When you look at that relative to a U.S. business that is in the upper 60 percentiles overall, we have a lot of room to go. And a lot of it has to do with what Jim just mentioned, which is staffing, scheduling, positioning, as well as the physical plans that we have. So we're doing more dual-lane drive-thru, more handheld order taker, kiosk opportunities in France and other areas. So those kinds of things in Europe. Breakfast, if you look at Europe in terms of the number of restaurants that we have serving breakfast, we have a long way to go. APMEA is probably moving forward in that direction a little quicker. We got about 70-plus percent of our restaurants that serve breakfast in APMEA -- across APMEA. But you've got certain markets that have really made a big jump. Malaysia, as an example, China. So we have good focus in Japan now on breakfast. So I think when you look across the board, those kinds of things will be big, as well as, you mentioned it again, extended hours. So we'll keep focusing on all of those opportunities. We have a lot of headroom left around the world in those areas.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Actually the question is on franchise margins. And I guess, maybe we could focus on U.S. and Europe. Is there anything that structurally prevents those margins from continuing to rise? And I ask that in terms of presumably, when you -- remodels are costs that get reflected into -- in the franchise margins as a cost, but there might be other things such as franchisee renewals and even, from your perspective, renewal of the underlying lease that the franchisees occupy. So there's a few different moving pieces that might be within that. But I guess, Pete, just hoping that you could comment on whether franchise margins can continue to expand with sales, which would be, I guess, the simplest way to think about that.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes, John. Yes is the short answer. You did mention a couple of things on the cost side that do impact it. So some higher depreciation if we're reimaging, potentially some higher underlying occupancy costs if we have a lease site and the rent is going up. But because a great majority of those franchise expenses are fixed, we get tremendous leverage by growing comps. And so if we continue to grow comps the way we expect we will, we believe franchise margins can continue to expand.\nKathy Martin: Our next question comes from Keith Siegner from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Another question about Europe, actually, and more from the perspective of an opportunity. The Olympics this summer, being in London, this the first time in a long time they're being hosted in a truly major market for McDonald's, and definitely since the brand -- I mean, both food and box have been so relevant and resonating so clearly. I mean, how big an opportunity is that this summer? And how do you approach that, this opportunity? Does it influence the timing and the approach of the marketing? I know you probably don't want to get into specifics, but is there anything you could talk about how this Olympics might be different than some of the others in the past?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, Keith, this is Jim Skinner. I heard your comment on this yesterday on CNBC, by the way, and thanks for the positive plug. But yes, it's an enormous opportunity for us. There's not a lot different about it except to say that it's sort of in the proper time zone, if you will, being in London and being in Europe. And so that you get viewing audiences from the U.S. and from all across Europe. And so that's good for us. Our success with the Olympics is always about the implementation of our efforts on the ground through all of this. We have all of our programs in place today to take advantage of opportunities for our crew people and the local communities to participate with the athletes, in many cases, and being associated with the Olympics and the Paralympics. We also, of course, are going to have 4 restaurants right there on site. We always do a great deal of business and have the brand front and center regarding that. And of course, the overall integration of these planning processes across the United States and around the rest of the world in conjunction with the Olympics is really the linchpin to the success of a particular Olympic event. And we're very optimistic about the plans that we have in place to do that. I'm hearing a lot of good news out of London, and the team there is doing a tremendous job preparing themselves for execution around this Olympics. And we expect great success. And as you know, we've signed just signed up through 2020 now. Don Thompson was just in Austria to execute that agreement. And we're excited about the association with the Olympics well into the future.\nKathy Martin: Next question comes from Phillip Juhan from BMO Capital.\nPhillip Juhan - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just thinking we'll get the food cost margin in the fourth quarter, I know you guys have guided for 4.5% to 5% food cost inflation. And it looks like, perhaps based on our calculations, that food cost, that food basket inflated at a slightly higher rate in the top end of that range. If that indeed was the case, can you discuss some of the more meaningful variances to plan?\nPeter J. Bensen: Phillip, for the U.S., we finished the year at 4.9%. So almost right in the middle of that 4.5% to 5.5%. And as we talked a lot throughout the year, beef was probably the biggest variable for us. Traditionally, you would see some of the beef prices come down after the summer months, and we didn't see that traditional decline in beef prices. So we have frankly ended the year with beef costs up in the mid-teens. And as we look at our guidance for 2012, we've built another mid-teens increase for beef, expecting that the dynamics in the marketplaces that we see and are expecting will continue.\nKathy Martin: And our last question now is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I was actually right along the same lines in terms of a little bit more color on the U.S. commodity basket, and Pete, you provided a little bit of that. Maybe then just dovetailing into that, does that impact anything you guys are anticipating doing on a promotional product basis this year? We obviously saw a lot of chicken last year. Does that continue to be an emphasis? And where do you think chicken prices will be for 2012?\nPeter J. Bensen: Andy, I'll talk a little bit about the pricing and Don can talk about some of the promotional activity. But we don't want to get into individual components. Beef was the most significant, so I call it out. Chicken is much more manageable in terms of the price increase that we expect in 2012. And the only other thing I'll say about the commodities is, different from prior years, more of the hedges this year were done using option contracts which allow us to participate in some of the downside. So as you know, for the price of chicken, around 40% of the cost is the cost of the feed. So hedging the grains is a big piece of controlling those chicken costs. And with using some of these option contracts, there is a potential, if the grain markets decline, that we'd come in a little more favorably than we expect on that. But certainly, the numbers we've given you assume the contract prices, and assume, as I mentioned, that mid-teens increase in beef.\nDonald Thompson: Andy, and relative to the promotional calendars, we try to take into account some of the commodity movements. But sometimes, they're so volatile that by the time you plan something out, which is typically at least 8 to 12 months ahead of the time that you all see it on the calendar, we don't have the level of flexibility. But the reason that we do McRibs when we do McRib and we look at some of the chicken-based products when we look at us some of the chicken-based products is part of our attempt to look at when those commodities are at their high points and make sure that we stay away from those time frames. But in a volatile economy and volatile commodity marketplace, that's a little difficult. So what we try to do is make sure that, even with the range of price change, that the food cost itself won't prevent us from being able to sell these products and have some decent margin at a restaurant level.\nKathy Martin: All right. That concludes our Q&A, so I'll turn it over to Jim, who has a few closing comments.\nJames A. Skinner: Thank you, Kathy. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize the fundamental strength of our global business. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that we can continue to drive results in any environment. We'll execute our proven customer-focused Plan to Win while strategically managing through the market forces around us. With our entire system aligned and committed to the success of the brand, I'm confident we'll keep delighting our customers and achieving our revenue income and return goals. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-10-21 18:30:08", "content": "Executives: James A.

As a request from McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, James Skinner; and our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Benson. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast.  Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments, and both documents are available at our website, www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with our corresponding GAAP measures. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim.\nJames A. Skinner: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share the latest business results for McDonald's, which highlight our continued strength. For the third quarter, global comparable sales were up 5%, and constant currency's operating income increased 8%, and EPS increased 6% to $1.45.  Our global success continues with every area in the world contributing. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter were up 4.4%, and operating income grew 6%. In Europe, comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.9%, and operating income grew 6% in constant currencies. And in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comp sales for the quarter increased 3.4%, and operating income grew 15% in constant currencies. And our momentum, I'm happy to say, is continuing into October with global comparable sales expected to be up 4% to 5%. McDonald's continues to drive results around the world by offering what customers are looking for today more than ever: great value, outstanding convenience, a modern restaurant experience and relevant, great-tasting menu offerings.  Our entire system of franchisees, suppliers and employers are aligned around our Plan to Win. And we continue to focus on executing at the highest level against our 3 global priorities: optimizing the menu with the right food and beverage offerings; modernizing the customer and employee experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to designs; and broadening accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives. Now as I've said before, it's not just one initiative but a combination of all of them that continue to drive our growth.  In the area of menu, we're seeing focused on the right balance of core products and new offerings are helping us stay relevant with consumers. We've continue to build on our equity in chicken. In the United States, this quarter, McNugget units were up nearly 10% over last year as we featured 4 new dipping sauces. In addition, our premium chicken sandwich line with the new flavor profile and bakery-style whole grain bun continued to perform strongly. In Australia, we launched 2 new chicken offerings, a chicken and cheese snack and one with the bone-in McWings. And both have been strong sellers. And in Japan, a renewed focus on Chicken Tatsuta, a chicken sandwich helped grow sales.  Beverages also remain on opportunity around the world. In the United States, we energized our McCaf\u00e9 line with 2 additions: Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple Real Fruit Smoothies. These new offerings added to our specialty Beverage lineup, helped to increase total McCaf\u00e9 beverage sales by 16% over last summer's strong numbers. McCaf\u00e9 is expanding globally as well. We're building the business across Europe, where we have more than 1,400 McCaf\u00e9s with Germany, leading the way at over 750. In APMEA, Australia has 650 McCaf\u00e9s, and we're planning to have approximately 250 in China by year's end. And while international McCaf\u00e9s are focused on hot beverages right now, we have a number of markets planning to test or add real fruit smoothies and frappes over the next few years, starting with Australia next month.  Our practice continues to be an important day part for McDonald's as well as an opportunity for the future. In China, breakfast is achieving double-digit comparable sales increases, and today has reached over 8% of sales. Europe has only begun to scratch the surface, with the U.K. continuing to experience strong sales results of 13% of sales. And in the U.S., where breakfast represents about 25% of sales, we've focused consumers in our lineup of wholesome offerings, from oatmeal and Egg McMuffin to our Yogurt Parfait and Fruit and Walnut salad. Total units on all of these products combined to increase more than 20% over last year and helped us to continue making gains during this very important part of the day.  In addition, premium products have continued to deliver results, with France being the most recent market-to-launch McWraps. These are large wraps with chicken or beef that have performed well across Europe.  Rounding out our menu news, Europe drove results with the use of customer-focused food events often featuring premium products. The U.K. built sales with a successful summer food event, highlighted by the return of the bacon chicken onion sandwich leveraging the success experienced in Europe, the U.S. is planning a number promotional food events in 2012 that will feature new food news.  Around the world, our markets are also making gains through strong experience in accessibility initiatives. Europe is furthest along in modernizing their restaurants with new and relevant designs to provide customers with a great experience. Each area of the world has benefited from Europe's experience and are making steady progress.  Meanwhile, all of our top markets continued their trend of improving customer satisfaction scores through a stronger focus on operations and service and technology, such as our new POS ordering system, which elevates speed and accuracy and is now in nearly all restaurants here in the United States. On the accessibility front, we're staying focused on serving more customers more often in a variety of ways. Across all geographies, we continue to expand our extended hours in order to be able to be open and available when and where our customers want us to be. We're also growing capacity, especially at the drive-thru. Drive-thru optimizations help drive results across APMEA, with countries such as Australia, and Japan registering the Lipton sales with a focus on their service excellence at the drive-thru. In the U.S., we're also elevating their commitment to drive-thru by side-by-side drive-thrus, where real estate will allow on handheld order takers where space is limited.  We're also broadening our accessibility by continuing to offer the most relevant value. Our value programs in breakfast and lunch continue to be important to growth across APMEA, including Australia which has made gains from its new value campaign. And all of our major markets in Europe continue to focus on the value provided by their popular mid-tier offerings, from Little Tasters in the U.K. to Snack Deluxe in Germany to P\u2019tits Plaisirs in France. With new flavors and promotions, we're keeping these lines fresh and engaging for customers and elevating our position as a leader in great taste and quality at a great value. We recognize today that the environment out there is still fragile. The economists say we're officially out of the recession. But it hardly feels that way. Unemployment is back up over 9% here in the U.S. and in similar rates around the world.  The stock market just ended its worst quarter in 2 years, and many major economies are barely growing, if at all. Consumers everywhere continue to be cautious and hesitant to spend, and the informal eating-out industry is growing at a very slow pace. So we remain in a market share battle, with every victory continuing to be hard won.  But we plan to keep winning. The examples I highlighted from across our system demonstrate how we strategically have strengthened our business in a comprehensive way. We remain committed to listening to our customers in meeting their needs at every turn, whether it's in today's environment or down the road as the economy improves.  Now moving forward, we're equally committed to maintaining a strong financial foundation and maximizing value for our shareholders. Our intent remains to return all of our free cash flow after reinvestment to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We recently announced a 15% increase on our quarterly cash dividend to $0.70 per share or the equivalent of $2.80 annually. And combined with share repurchases, we expect to total -- returned total cash to shareholders to 2011 to reach approximately $6 billion. I'd like to say, overall, I'm very pleased with our latest quarterly performance. While the economic recovery continues to be fragile around the world, we stay focused on what we can control, staying committed to our winning plans and delivering an exceptional experience for our more than 64 million customers around the world every day. I'm confident that by continuing to innovate, invest and execute, we will help to continue delighting our customers in growing our business around the world. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Pete Bensen, our CFO.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. McDonald's continued to deliver solid results despite another quarter marked by rising cost and macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We're successfully navigating through this environment because of our alignment and focus around the Plan to Win. This continues to yield significant increases in comparable sales, market share and operating income. Through the first nine months, revenues increased 8% in constant currency. And over that same period, our combined operating margin increased 40 basis points to 31.8%. This 80% of our 33,000 restaurants are franchised. Our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In the third quarter, franchise margins reached $1.9 billion, an increase of $133 million in constant currency, with each area of the world contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter rose 40 basis points to 83.7%, driven by positive comparable sales. Global company operating margin dollars increased to $26 million in constant currencies for the quarter to $972 million. The margin percentage decreased 100 basis points to 20% as strong comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs, primarily commodities.  Our McOpCo margin percentage remains at impressive levels considering the current operating environment.  In the U.S., the company operating margins declined 90 basis points to 21.1% for the third quarter due to an 8% rise in commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher occupancy and other costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. The third quarter margin percentage benefited by about 40 basis points due to the recognition of a special payroll tax credit created by the HIRE Act.  These prices, which typically moderate after the summer, have remained high. As a result, we now expect commodity cost in the U.S. to be up a little more than previously expected, 4.5% to 5% for the full year, with fourth quarter increases easing compared to second and third quarter. Partially offsetting the rising cost are the 2 price increases taken thus far in 2011, the 1% increase in March and the 1.4% increase at the end of May. We're seeing good flow-through to the bottom line from these increases. In addition, food-at-home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, which might allow for additional pricing actions in the near term. We will continue to evaluate additional price increases in light of this inflationary environment, always balancing our goal of driving traffic and market share gains with effectively managing the impact of rising costs. As we look into 2012, we expect commodity cost increases in the U.S. to be similar to this year's. In Europe, third quarter company operating margins declined 110 basis points to 20.9%, primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, also partly offset by positive comparable sales. In addition to prudently managing cost across the continent, our European management team has developed effective marketing plans that feature value throughout the menu to drive sales. In third quarter, several premium products, offered in our predominantly reimaged interiors, were showcased within promotional food events. This included the Big Tasty in France, the Stars of America in Germany and the launch of the premium 1955 hamburger in the U.K.  Our price increases vary across the 40 European markets. Russia, which is experiencing higher inflation, is an outlier. Most other European markets are averaging year-over-year price increases around 2%. As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the extreme economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment amidst the austerity measures and shrinking disposable income. we will continue to monitor this closely, aware of the ongoing inflationary pressures, while doing what is right to the long-term health of our business. Similar to the U.S., Europe slightly increases estimate for the full year commodity cost increase to 4.5% to 5% primarily due to higher beef costs. this implies the fourth quarter increase slightly above the annual guidance.  Turning to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the company operating margins for the quarter decreased 50 basis points to 18.4%, also reflecting inflationary cost pressures partially offset by comparable sales increases. similar to the first half of the year, the acceleration of new restaurants, openings in China, negatively impacted this segment's margin percentage.  Menu continues to be a significant driver of comparable sales growth in APMEA. Innovative locally relevant product offerings of chicken, the dominant protein in this region, as well as breakfast, compelling value offerings and a sustained core menu focus are building loyalty among our customer base. Strong consistent financial performance from our unique business model generates meaningful amounts of cash flow. We reinvest the significant amount of this cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns.  Our restaurant development teams are making excellent progress against their plans for reimaging and building new restaurants, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities. As a result, we are slightly increasing our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion. Reimaging remains an immense opportunity for us because the majority of our exteriors and interiors do not reflect our current contemporary look.  We continue to make progress across the globe on our reimaging efforts. As of last week, we have completed over 360 reimages in the U.S., and given what we have under construction, we are on track to complete and likely exceed 600 by the end of the year. On average, it is taking about 8 weeks to complete the exterior and interior reimaging. And as we head into the winter months, construction times will likely increase. During construction, the front counter is often closed for a period. But in nearly all cases, the drive-thru remains open to minimize any sales declines. Most of the other owner operators who have committed to reimaging their restaurants this year sought to avoid construction during the busy summer months. That explains why over 270 projects have broken ground since Labor Day.  Our owner operators remain committed to reimaging. Our pipeline of projects is growing because they also view this as an important evolution of our brand. I think it also speaks to their long-term commitment to making the necessary investments to keep McDonald's increasingly relevant to our customers.  In Europe, we have reimaged over 600 restaurants through September. France plan to have all of this interiors and half of its exteriors reimaged by the end of this year. And the U.K. expects nearly all of its restaurants will be reimaged by the end of 2012, having just recently completed its 1000th project. In the APMEA, we're also making significant reimaging progress, having completed approximately 100 reimages in both Japan and China. Currently, about 20% of China's store base reflects the updated image. But with new restaurant openings and planned reimages, that number should approach what 40% by the end of next year. We expect to open between 1,100 and 1,200 new restaurants this year on our base of 33,000, an increase of over 3%. New openings by areas of the world include over 150 in the U.S., more than 225 in Europe and about 650 in APMEA. China is on track to finish near the upper end of the 175 to 200 new opening range. Lastly, let's turn to foreign currency translation, which positively impacted third quarter results by $0.08. At current exchange rates, we expect full year EPS to benefit by about $0.20, which implies a minimal fourth quarter EPS benefit. But as I always say, this is directional guidance only, given the volatility we are experiencing. Our third quarter and nine-month results are a testament to the strength of the Plan to Win and its effectiveness in a persistently challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment. Our business model is resilient. The alignment within our system is strong, and we are seizing opportunities now to secure an even brighter future for McDonald's. I remain confident that we will continue to drive value for our shareholders over the long term.  Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.\nKathy Martin: [Operator Instructions] So our first question is from Jeff Omohundro from Wells Fargo.\nJeffrey F. Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The Europe performance, Europe sales seem be holding up very well in the face of the economic and political challenges there. I'm wondering if you could give us any color on changes in consumer behavior you might be seeing there? And perhaps, elaborate a bit on the strong performance in September.\nJames A. Skinner: Jeff, I think first of all, we're very confident in our business model in Europe, and we've continued to perform there. I think, really, August was a bit of an aberration in the overall scheme of things relative to plan days and promotional activities from previous -- from a year ago. And so, we continue to be confident in our initiatives there. And we're not seeing a big impact, really, to our guest counts and the growth in the marketplaces with some of the austerity measures and some of the economic issues that are there, that are impacting certainly discretionary income. And so, it's been actually a good example of how well our business model adapts in these various marketplaces around the world and in different kinds of economic environments we find ourselves in, which is been our history. As you know, it's not the first time we've had to deal with these kinds of things around the world. We've had our presence in Europe for a long time and have gone through various ups and downs in the economies and yet, have been able to deliver steady performance on behalf of brand McDonald's. Because of our business model and the way we're structured, the everyday affordability, as we like to say, our customer's getting pinched everywhere. They shouldn't get that at McDonald's. And even these austerity measures and the lifestyles in Europe, although they can be more harsh in some environments than others, I think the standard of living and the discretionary income has to be impacted very, very severely for us to start to feel that impact at the McDonald's front counter and drive-thru.\nKathy Martin: Next is David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: You've been ramping up pricing through the years slowly, and I can understand why you have feel like you have more pricing power than the 2.5% given that 6%-type pricing that's going on at home at home food lately. But my question is on Europe. It feels like you've been fairly stingy on pricing there too away from the VAT, only 2% outside of the hyperinflationary Russia. And given that VATs may not soak up as much of your pricing power in 2012, I would wonder why you wouldn't feel like you can't maintain some sort of moderate pricing next year. What is giving you the conclusion or the feeling that maybe you don't have as much room there, if I'm getting that vibe correct?\nJames A. Skinner: I think, David, first of all, you're very familiar with our discipline around pricing. And we take it at a point in time in terms of the impact of the marketplace, food away at home, food at home, and as you know, we try to balance that across the indexing. And of course, the economic environment. But mostly, we measure this by the cost environment and this food away from home. And it doesn't mean, based on everything we've said, that we won't look at pricing for next year. We probably will. We look at it on a regular basis but can't really predict when we would take a price increase, because it all matters -- it matters in terms of what we're seeing in the indexing at that point time. I don't know that we've said we don't feel like we have the elasticity there. I just think we're just very, very cautious in the face of the economic environment we find ourselves in over there. And we're going to be very prudent about the way we go about pricing. As you said though, we did take the 2.5% right off the top in the U.K. when they had that VAT change. And I think the important thing is that it hasn't had any impact really on our guest counts and traffic in the restaurants.\nKathy Martin: Next is Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: [Audio Gap] Europe, I mean, what's going on over there? What about the emerging markets? It seems like, as I understand it, GDP is starting to roll over a bit. And in China, more severely at least at this point in Brazil, few other places. Are you seeing any impact your stores?\nPeter J. Bensen: Michael, really, I would say no, we haven't. China for the quarter delivered another strong comp. It was 11.3% for the quarter on top of a double-digit comp last year in the third quarter with double-digit guest count growth in both periods. So China continues to perform strongly for us. The other emerging markets within APMEA, so the South Korea, the Taiwans, the Philippines, the Hong Kong, et cetera. All of those helped contribute toward the performance in the quarter and are seeing good sales and traffic growth. We've always talked about the importance of value in that particular region of the world, especially. And it continues to be important. But our formula over there is working well, and we're continuing to see not only good sales and traffic, but the profitability.\nKathy Martin: Next is Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: [Audio Gap] in China a little bit, continued very strong results there. And with the commodity outlook, at least at the last update was impressively below the trends in both the commodity markets and what we're seeing from basically almost everyone else in that market. I'm just wondering, is the current -- what is the current commodity outlook for China for this year? And to achieve such a dramatically low inflation relative to others, was this effective contracting? Was there something else? I only ask because if 2011 was a result of really wise contracting, could 2012 turn out to be a much more inflationary a year there? And then, how do you think about pricing in China as a result?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, Keith, I'll start. And then, I'll let Pete talk to you about the details in terms of what he thinks, say up [ph] what's commodity cost there for the future. But our supply chain, connected with our treasury and our suppliers, do a magnificent job relative to mitigating the impact on overall basis regarding these commodity costs around the world. And sometimes, I don't think they get enough credit for this because we take it very seriously and the process works very well for us. And it's not the case for everybody. They don't simply have that sort of structure or capability. And so, I think that's the reason why you've seen the results you've seen in kind in that regard. Relative to the future, I'll let Pete talk to you a little bit about what we're looking at.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes, and Keith, I know we had an investor meeting over there where we gave some commodity information. That isn't something that we're going to typically update every quarter. But I will tell you that it's based on the things Jim mentioned, and as we have a preliminary look at next year, we don't see any dramatic spike from that. So I don't see us having to do anything dramatically different on the pricing side as a result of commodities. As you know, there's continual pressure on labor over there. And while we continue to keep our rates ahead of the minimums, there's always going to be some constant labor pressure as well. But as we sit today, we don't see anything dramatically different about next year compared to this year that's going to cause any different pricing perspective.\nKathy Martin: Next is Nicole Miller Regan from Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: If we can turn back to the U.S. and like everyone else, have a question on pricing. I've heard through the third quarter earnings season so far, some companies reference barbell strategy, and I know you use a tiered approach. Could you talk about the importance of the tiered approach? And then as specific as you can, where do you have the flexibility and what categories or types of items can you tell us where you sort of feel like you could take the price?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, Nicole, I think -- I couldn't tell you specifically about each one of those categories, to be honest with you. But I leave that up to the U.S. team to figure that out. But the tiered pricing process has given us the opportunity to be able to have value across the menus. So if you look at Dollar Menu, then the tiered pricing and the middle, and some of those great value offerings that we have in the menu, snack wraps, et cetera. And then on the premium end with the premium sandwiches, premium salads, and that sort of thing, we weigh all of that when we take a look at the menu mix relative to pricing and value for our consumer, and then make a decision around that. And I couldn't tell you exactly where the elasticity is. If I could, you'd probably think I'm spending my time in the wrong place. But the U.S. team has every geography is very, very good at this. And it's all based on market consumer data that we use in the pricing mix, as Pete mentioned, food away from home, food at home. And it gets broken down across the menu based on what we know about our product mix in the U.S. and elasticity there.\nKathy Martin: Next up is Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.\nGregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just as a follow-up on the U.S. pricing, I mean, are you looking more at kind of what your competitors as well as other channels are doing in terms of pricing? Are you looking at your own transactions? And talk about sensitivities, I guess ask with your customers so just kind of looking at that economic sensitivity. What's pretty much the biggest driver, what will determine...\nJames A. Skinner: I think certainly the biggest drivers is certainly our consumer, and their feelings about our pricing and everyday affordability on the menu. Yes, we take a look at what competitors are doing, but not because we will necessarily make a decision based on that, but we take all things into consideration as we look across the marketplace. But mostly, it's about this index of food at home and food away from home, and we're very judicious about our price increases because maintaining everyday affordability, particularly in the environment that we're in today, is paramount. And we have a pricing model that we use very, very effectively. And yet, it takes intuition and a gut feeling about when to pull the trigger on these kinds of things. And we take all of those factors into consideration because our pricing model and around our commodity cost and our supply chain. And our ability to sort of manage the impact of those costs at the restaurant level is very important to us. And not every other organization that takes prices or moves their pricing up and down has that strength or capability. And so, although we look at what others do and pay attention to that, really, it's an inside game here at McDonald's relative to pricing based on what our consumers are expecting from us.\nOperator: Next is Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Can you talk about the modest step-up in expansion plans to 2011? And this reflects maybe a little bit more aggressive posture, those expansion going forward into 2012 and beyond?\nJames A. Skinner: Yes, Joe. This is Jim. When you look at our numbers around return on incremental invested capital, which as you know, has been one of our hurdle rates since our revitalization plan in all '03, has shown us that we -- because the results have been so great, the goal was high teens, and we've been in the 25th to 40th percentile, depending on what segment of the business you're looking at. And much of that, combined with the average unit volumes of these new restaurants are coming on at, and our development tools that we have been able to use around the world to determine where best to grow and have all come together and sort of given us permission to grow more restaurants around the world. And that's the simple reason. But we spend a very great amount of time around here and due diligence and not just throwing numbers out because we've had good results and say, \"Well, we'll just up it.\" We take a real hard look at the metrics around new store openings and demand that our geographies pay attention to that and continue to deliver on things that are important as we grow the business. But that's really the reason as we -- we've had good results, and the ROI I see has demonstrated that those new restaurants have come online at a very productive and profitable way, and therefore, more opportunity.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just had a question on the restaurant-level margins, and I recognize most of the profits are coming from the franchise side. But just touching on the restaurant margins, looking at the items away from food, it would seem you guys would've may be seemed a little bit more leverage on those items this year given the strong comps and just didn't know if there's anything there that's a little bit out of the ordinary or a little more inflationary than you expected. And so, there's an opportunity on some of these items next year to improve the restaurant margins if you have another tough year on inflation.\nPeter J. Bensen: Jason, I would say there's nothing in there that was significantly different or is a particular outlier. It just so happens that almost every category of those cost is going in the wrong direction. So utility's up a little bit. Depreciation, up a little bit. That, in part, due to our reimaging efforts. Labor is up. The average wage is up in the U.S. and generally around the world. So there's no one particular item or no particular item is driving a significant piece of it. But just a general inflation across all of the line items is really what's underneath that. And since we look to next year, I don't know that there's going to be anything dramatic on those line items either.\nJames A. Skinner: It's also important to note that we're right around all-time highs in the margins on the company side. And this all gets back to pricing and top line and how much of that you can mitigate, and certainly, don't know if wanted to do that to the expense of the customers. So we take all that into consideration, but you have to continue to look at the fact that, that number is at a pretty high level relative to the overall history of margins in the company.\nKathy Martin: Next question is Matt DiFrisco from Lazard Capital Markets.\nMatthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Two questions, I guess. You mentioned China and some of the margins there being impact a little bit by the new store development. I wondered, can you describe what we should see over the next couple of years, looking at sort of 50% of your store base is under 3 years old? When does it flip where the new, younger stores are actually starting to ramp up and what does that look like as it progresses in the margins? And then also on Europe, the remodels. I was wondering if you could tell us what we should suspect or what we should expect in what you're seeing as far as same-store sales trends off of those stores have been now remodeled maybe 2 or 3 years ago?\nJames A. Skinner: Matt, Jim Skinner. I'll start off with China, and I'll let Pete talk about Europe and add his two cents in on China. First of all, the way we've developed in China in the major cities, where we're mainly focused, is through new developments, if you will. So the Chinese are very disciplined around developing new retail outlets and a whole combination of things. They do these like cities, if you will. And so, we go into those because we know we need to be there, but in fact, we go in there early as compared to the overall developments. So you're going to see a benefit, I think, in year 2 or 3 on some of those new stores, which should start to have an impact on that overall margin relative to the new store growth. And it's the best way for us to develop the market because we need to be in those environments. But it takes a little time for them to come on, as the other population retail engagement in those properties begin to come online in a meaningful way.\nPeter J. Bensen: And Matt, that isn't dramatically different from what we see in other countries. It maybe 10 basis points higher in China because of some of the specifics Jim mentioned. But generally, they start out a little bit lower, and then by the third year, they've pretty much caught up to the market average. So if you think about what we're doing in China from a development standpoint, we opened 166 last year. We're going to open close to 200 or 200 this year. That kind of incremental ramp up in new stores is really what's kind of causing that impact as we continue to increase the number of openings every year, while slightly have more impact. But it's definitely, at the same time, you've got more stores that are maturing to help offset that. So again, it's not dramatic, but it is something we keep an eye on but is performing consistent with how other markets performed during their kind of their development ramp-up phase. And in terms of the reimaging across Europe, similar to the U.S., those first year comps are up 6% to 7% ahead of the marketplace. And if you've seen the results in Europe over the last couple of years, sales continue to grow in that regard. So we're comfortable that we're still seeing sales increases above the market in those restaurants. And yet, there's more than that just that sales increase that drives improvement in the customer's attitude about McDonald's and the surroundings they're in, their perception of the cleanliness of the restaurant, the quality of service and the food. So it helps build that customer loyalty and drive more repeat business. So it's performing the way we had hoped and expected it to.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, a quick look out to 2012, and I'm sure we'll get a little bit more detail on this at the Analyst Day next month. But as you look at the U.S. business promotionally, product wise, is there new elements in the marketing strategy for next year? Would you characterize the year next year as more of kind of a line extension and re-hit some of the more recent things?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes. Andy, I think it's probably closer to the latter. I think if you look at the success we've had in 2011 -- so here we are 9 months in, we had some pretty significant weather the first couple of months, and yet, we're still at a 4% comp nine months in. Really, we're at a combination of line extensions and what we call these premium food events, which is a limited time offering. So from the introduction of oatmeal to the barbecue bacon, fourth flavor on the Angus to the Asian salad, which was on for a limited time and a couple of new beverages, et cetera, I think as we review the 2012 calendar for the U.S., it feels like a similar year to 2011.\nKathy Martin: Next question is Mitch Speiser, Buckingham Research.\nMitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And as we think about 2012, and Pete, I think you mentioned food costs about in line with 2011. If we look at the third quarter, I think, we all probably think that comps were better than expected, if and margins were worse than expected, when we think about 2012 given the cost that was the same, should we think about continued store-level margin pressure as we try to build out our models?\nPeter J. Bensen: Well, Mitch, if you look at the third quarter, specifically in the U.S., costs were up 8%, which was the highest for the year so far. They were up 6% in the second quarter and about 1% in the first. So it's by far was the worst quarter. Europe was up about 5% for the quarter, which was kind of similar to the second quarter for them. But the one thing you have to consider is, certainly, in the U.S., when we flip the calendar to January of 2011, we had 0 pricing increases rolling over from the previous year. Whereas, when we flip the calendar to 2012, those first 2 months will have the benefit of the previous 12 months of price increases that we've taken in the U.S. So that's certainly a factor and something we consider as we think about price increases, frankly, the rest of this year. And I think something similar in Europe, why we don't have the a preliminary estimate nailed down quite yet in Europe with the volatility and some of the currency markets over there and the commodities, they're going to have a year probably that's similar or maybe a little bit better than the U.S. from a cost side. But we'll have an opportunity to refine that and maybe share it at the analyst meeting. But it's going to continue to be, as we look at what is going on in the marketplace, is the consumer in a place that we're comfortable, we can continue to add price increases or continue to monitor the impact on them. If you look, as Jim made some comments about Europe, with everything going on there daily around the sovereign debt crisis and what's going on, especially in the 2 big markets we do business in that are, the ones that are supposed to bail out the continent, hearing that all the time in the press does play on the consumer psyche. So we'll continue to be mindful of that, and we'll do what's going to be best for the long-term business from a price side and managed the input [ph] cost as best as we can.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just 2 follow-ups. First, on the food cost side of things. May it seems like with 1 quarter to go, you raised both the U.S. and European basket at 50 basis points, which would seem to imply like the fourth quarter is probably riding a couple of hundred basis points above a plan and a quarter ago. Just trying to understand more conceptually how something like that has happened throughout the year in terms of what's locked, what's kind of still exposed, it sounds like it's beef that's the primary driver, but was wondering if you could look at potentially what's contracted, whether we should assume that kind of continued pressure. I don't think you said that you finalize the European basket yet, but just trying to understand kind of how it's contracted out, how it can continues to rise. And then the follow-up question was just on foreign exchange. I think you gave good color on the fourth quarter as the impact, and I don't want to be too specific for next year. But if rates remain where they were right now, kind of what would be the impact, the early read on 2012 FX?\nPeter J. Bensen: All right, Jeff. The one issue with the commodities is, we only give you guidance updates once a quarter. And so, you can't necessarily assume that all of the increase in our guidance is going to be felt in the fourth quarter, because we actually started experiencing that in August and September. And so, while we knew the third quarter was going to be probably the highest cost-increase quarter of the year, heading into that quarter, and that's what we had messaged in July. It actually, primarily, because of the beef costs, which as you know, historically, is our least protected and hedged item. That drove the increases. So you're not seeing a 200 basis point deviation from our expectations in the fourth quarter on cost increases. It's actually much closer than that. And we're not going to get into item by item, how much of this is protected. But we've consistently said that beef is the wildcard for us in terms of it has the least amount of locked-in pricing. And so, while we didn't see the traditional falloff in prices after the summer of grilling season that we've historically seen, and that falloff frankly was built into our last forecast. But it's manageable for us. And the good news is, in the fourth quarter in the U.S., those cost increases are going to be well below what they were in the second and third quarters. So that's good. And probably at the analyst meeting is when we'll start to give a first look at currency. To be honest with you, I haven't even formulated a view on that yet.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A question I think related just on the products overall in the U.S. for 2012. I mean, certainly, the new point-of-sale system does allow increased speed and accuracy, so we want to get a sense of how that might influence product development, what you offer to the customers and whether 2012 or beyond. And secondly, given the fact that in sort of your competition is you kind of backed-off focus, I mean, perhaps by necessity on their value menus and what your thought is of promotion of your Dollar Menu in 2012, I mean, might it be less than what it's been in previous years based on less from the competition?\nJames A. Skinner: Well, I don't -- John, this is Jim. I don't know for sure exactly how much emphasis we want to put on Dollar Menu for next year, except to say Dollar Menu is here to stay. We have supported our franchisees for the Dollar Menu going into 2012. The system for alignment around everyday affordability is extraordinarily strong. And it's going to continue to be important, and we will continue to communicate that to our consumers. And so, I don't see a lot of change there. Relative to overall menu development and new product news, the U.S. is going to probably continue to talk about breakfast. They'll talk about big sandwiches and other mid-tier. The problem we have with a company like McDonald's is that the expectation around communication around all those of things is expected by our consumers. And of providing them that choice on the menu has to continue to get better, not get stale or go soft. And so, I expect that we will continue to communicate strongly around all of those day parts and all of those menu platforms.\nPeter J. Bensen: And John, as you pointed out, the new register system is certainly one of the tools that will help facilitate that. Our old register system couldn't have handled in any reasonable way the additional choice and variety that Jim is mentioning. And it helps facilitate the introduction more easily as some of these what we call premium food events or rotating events that items will come on the menu for 6, 8, 12 weeks and then go away, we couldn't have done that as easily or efficiently with our old register system. So it is definitely a key piece of our menu strategy.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from David Tarantino, Robert W Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Pete, just a question on overall franchise profitability. I was wondering if you had any insight on how franchisees have been able to manage through the current environment in terms of their own cash flow profitability and whether they're seeing some of the similar pressures you're seeing on the restaurant cash flow margin line? And if so, has that made them any less enthusiastic about investing in initiatives like reimaging or any of the product initiatives you have coming?\nJames A. Skinner: Yes, David, this is Jim. Although, I think you asked Pete the question, I was just with franchisees last week and the week before that here in the United States. And of course, we pay very close attention to franchisee cash flow and profitability going all the way back to Ray Kroc, who said, \"First, the franchisees make money, and then everything else follows.\" And we've not changed our philosophy around that in 55 years. And so, the headline is, that it continues to be very, very good. It is off slightly this year, but it's off a record high last year. And the franchisees I think are very, very pleased, particularly, when you look at the alignment of the organization around our initiatives, which we collaborate on very closely. First of all, we don't make decisions here at the center and then bark our orders to our franchisees. They're part of the process in the Plan to Win. And to profitability, regarding those initiatives, it's always a factor as we move forward with the progress and the sustainable growth of the organization, which revolves around the cash flow for the franchisees. It's a very good place right now and continues to be in a good place. And much of this because of the system support for the franchisee profitability, as we talked earlier about supply chain and locking and food costs that are going to be appropriate for them to be able to maintain some level of cash flow that's important to them. In spite of the fact that we have these enormous commodity-cross increases that we've operated with, we work together. We do a very good job on this, and I think you would find that they're very happy and supportive of the initiatives and because we decide together.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.\nSara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I just wanted to kind of wrap back to the U.S comp broadly and say, \"I think it's been so impressive in terms of how much you've outpaced the market and certainly the macro indicators.\" So you've talked a little bit about initiatives. Can you kind of bucket where -- are you spending more on advertising in total? Is it just that your competitors are spending less? Is it are you doing better? Are your comps better in breakfast, for example, or snacking, where you tend to be more dominant? Just trying to understand, in the absence of a major product launch, how it is that your comp trend has been so sustainable for so long?\nJames A. Skinner: Sure, this is Jim. First of all, on the communication in the share voice, on advertising with our consumers. It's remained as a percentage of historical expense, about the same and about the same nationally, except to say that we will continue to maintain those levels during the recession and the downturn. And so, our shared voice continues to be very, very strong, and we've always had the attitude of McDonald's that we need to be communicating at the same or greater levels during difficult times as compared to healthier times. And so, that's continued to grow and be very, very effective for us. But that's been the case really forever around here. Relative to the day part growth, we've had day part growth really across the board. And I talked in my comments this morning about the growth around the breakfast and some of the items, the Egg McMuffin and the value items and the nutritional items, oatmeal and the rest. And so -- and we're very balanced in our communication with our consumers around these things without -- because we don't have the luxury of pushing one side of the business versus another side of the business, because we've got such high hurdles to really get over regarding the overall experience throughout the entire business day. And so we're very pleased with the results. But I think you would see a very sort of deliberate, focus around all of day parts and communication and continuing to maintain our share of voice, which by the way is very supported nationally by our franchisees and they're somewhere in the 1% to 2% range and overall store contribution, with local contribution is somewhere in the 3% to 6% range. And it's sort of been that way for the last few years.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer.\nBrian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: When you look at the stores that you'll be remodeling across the globe over the next few years, what percentage, if you can quantify, are more than just an interior-exterior phase? With what percentage of these really of the opportunity to meaningfully increase the throughput and efficiency of the store kind of outside of just implementing new POS systems?\nPeter J. Bensen: Brian, I don't have the specific reimage plan by country in front of me over the next couple of years. But I will tell you that a majority of them have an opportunity to undergo a major improvement. What we see in the U.S., and this probably should make sense, but when we're able to, because we have enough real estate, add a side-by-side drive-thru, at the same time, we're doing the full interior and exterior reimage, we're seeing the greatest sales increase. And anything we can do to increase that capacity is going to just kind of exponentially improve the sales that you get from just doing the reimaging interior and exterior. But we look at that, and as Jim mentioned in his remarks, if we don't have the real estate to do the side by side, then we go down and say, \"All right, well then, let's use a handheld order taker to try to get those multiple order points in the drive-thru to increase our capacity.\" And I think today, we have almost 1,000 of those handhelds in the U.S. and increasing those numbers. So there is plenty of opportunity to continue these improved results that we're seeing today.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from RJ Hottovy from MorningStar.\nRonald J. Hottovy - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question about the international McCaf\u00e9 rollout especially I see you moved past hot beverages. Just wondering if you had any expectations in terms of incremental sales per location? In the past, you talked adding about $125,000 per location in the U.S., and I believe that's the whole beverage platform, but just any kind of expectations with the international McCaf\u00e9 rollout?\nJames A. Skinner: RJ, this is Jim. On the McCaf\u00e9, we've served beverages around the world differently forever, really. So if you like, you can take McCaf\u00e9s. McCaf\u00e9s really started in Australia. McCaf\u00e9s have expanded in Europe. Europe really had what they would call their McCaf\u00e9 program before the United States. And so, the United States version, of course, in line with the front counter, so we can facilitate drive-thru. These are all really different concepts. And yet, with the expansion of the blended iced drinks and the smoothies and the other kinds of things into the markets around the world, I would say that, okay, as we review our plans coming up in the next month or so for 2012 from the area of the worlds, I would doubt whether they really have that quantified to the extent where I would be able to tell you what expectation is on a store-by-store basis. The reason why we quantified it the way we did for United States is because you asked us to, one. And two, because at a wholesale basis, we were rolling out something that was going to impact nearly 14,000 stores. And so, we were capable of doing it that way because it was a unified program that was consistent throughout every store. We don't have that same experience in every store other than the fact that if you're selling fruit smoothies, that might be consistent. But the footprint platform and the ability for us to be able to expand McCaf\u00e9 is somewhat different in every market.\nKathy Martin: Okay, and this will be our last question, as we're running out of time. It is from Jon Tower from Morgan Stanley.\nJon Tower - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Given what's going on in the European macro environment, just curious to know if you're beginning to see any lower labor turnover at the store level and/or any lower cost advertise in that market?\nJames A. Skinner: I wouldn't say, Jon, that we've seen anything significant there. We've had very good results over the past number of years because of our people migration plans and understanding the relationship as you modernize the experience in the restaurant. It has to be modernized for the customer or for the employees as well. And we do a lot of things there to retain our people in the organization. And yet, I wouldn't say that because of austerity or the unemployment numbers or any of these other issues that we're facing, all of our people around the world that, that yet has changed significantly.\nKathy Martin: Okay, with that, I'll turn it back to Jim with -- he has a few closing comments.\nJames A. Skinner: Yes. I just like to say thanks for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize the ongoing strength of our global business and our confidence in the continued success of our brand. I think we've demonstrated our fundamentals, and Plan to Win strategy is strong and I'm optimistic that we will continue to drive results in the future. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Good morning, and thanks for joining us, everyone. With me on the call today are Chief Operating Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and the 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.\nDonald Thompson: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our latest business results, which continue to be strong. For the second quarter, global comparable sales were up 5.6%. Operating income increased 11% in constant currencies and EPS reached $1.35, an 11% increase in constant currencies. We also returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our momentum continues, with July global comparable sales expected to be about 4% to 5%.  Our performance is broad-based. We continue to grow share in every area of the world despite an informal eating-out market that remains relatively flat overall.  Now I've had an opportunity to spend time in many of our major markets around the world over the past several months, and I'm pleased to say that we're focused on taking our business to the next level. The system is aligned around 3 global growth priorities that support our Plan to Win. And we're confident that our emphasis on optimizing and evolving our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our brand will continue to move our business forward. Now when it comes to optimizing and evolving the menu, we are leveraging our iconic products and billion-dollar brands, we're innovating in key menu categories like beverages and chicken, and we're elevating our food image around the world.  Our second priority, which is modernizing the customer experience, is really all about improving both how our restaurants look and feel and how they operate. We keep looking for ways to create efficiencies and build capacity so that we can accommodate our continued guest count growth.  In addition to reimaging our restaurants, we're leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience to make the jobs of our managers and crew easier. For example, innovations like our new point-of-sale system and self-order kiosks, enable restaurant employees to focus on what matters most, the customer experience, and what we call the moment of truth. Our third priority, which is broadening accessibility to our brand, is about driving growth through value and convenience. You see, to us, value means a great customer experience delivered at a great price so that our customers get the biggest bang for their buck, their yen, euro or pound. The second component of accessibility, which is convenience, is about daypart expansion and continuing to open new restaurants when and where appropriate.  Ensuring our plan's focus on these 3 global priorities enables our teams to be more effective in terms of integrating and aligning their initiatives under the Plan to Win. This is particularly important as we execute against our biggest opportunities by leveraging one of our core competencies, operations excellence.  Now I'd like to share a few highlights from each of the areas of the world. Let's begin with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.5% and operating income grew 6%. We continue to take share in the IEO marketplace even as the overall industry traffic has been relatively flat.  These are strong results, especially in today's environment, where unemployment levels are still high and consumer confidence continues to waver. Our performance has been driven by a combination of everyday value, the introduction of compelling new menu items, a sustained focus on core favorites and an ongoing emphasis on improving restaurant operations.  We continue to capture an even greater share of the beverage market with the introduction of Frozen Strawberry Lemonade to our McCaf\u00e9 line up. To keep the news coming, we added another great tasting smoothie flavor, Mango Pineapple, at the end of June.  Total McCaf\u00e9 beverage sales rose 29% over second quarter 2010 on top of the gains realized last year. And we're still featuring dollar soft drinks and sweet tea in a majority of our restaurants.  The U.S. has also been promoting its flagship products that offer great taste and value. Advertising the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder drove unit sales up double digits. And the promotion of shareable 20 piece McNuggets and a new lineup of dipping sauces also delivered positive results.  Now at the same time, customers appreciate the choices we provide during the early morning hours, with signature breakfast products like the Egg McMuffin, the Dollar Menu and our Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, breakfast continues to contribute to results. Our oatmeal is just one example of how we keep evolving the nutritionals of our menu. Another great example is the premium chicken sandwiches that have been reinvented with a new marinade and are now served on a roll with 8 grams of whole grain. We're committed to continuing our focus on this important area and evolving as appropriate.  Now we also continue to make progress with our modernization efforts on multiple fronts, from reimaging and rebuilding restaurants to exploring new ways to expand capacity. We just begun to tap capacity opportunities with the addition of side-by-side drive-thrus. We now have about 2,200 in the U.S., in addition to a growing number of hand-held order takers that are also helping increase throughput in our drive-thrus. The U.S. also continues to rollout a new point-of-sale system that simplifies the order taking process. It improves accuracy and it enables our crew to better provide customer service. Today, it's in more than 10,000 restaurants in the U.S. The plan is to have it in virtually all of our restaurants in the U.S. by the end of the year.  So let's switch over to Europe. Comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.9% and operating income grew 10% in constant currencies. While the overall IEO market was flat, we continue to increase our market share around Europe. The big 4 markets in Europe, France, the U.K., Russia and Germany, continue contributing to results.  Now while austerity measures are pressuring consumers purchasing power, these markets and many across Europe have continued to grow sales, guest counts and operating income. Results for the segment were driven by a compelling menu of signature offerings, new products across price tiers, a growing breakfast daypart and a continued emphasis on modernizing the restaurant experience. Our strong guest count numbers in the region have reaffirmed the fact that we're pulling the right levers to remain a compelling destination. For example, premium products like McWrap, a new line of large chicken and beef wraps, are now in 17 countries in Europe. 11 markets are featuring the 1955, which is a burger topped with grilled onions, bacon and smoky barbecue sauce and served on a gourmet roll. This nostalgic taste has become Germany's best-performing premium sandwich.  Mid-tier offerings like the Little Tasters in the U.K. and Snack Deluxe in Germany continue to elevate our position as the leader in great taste at mid-tier prices.  Europe also continues to elevate our food image as we increase our emphasis on telling our story. A great example of this is the UK's new A-Z quality campaign. Now this campaign celebrates the sheer quantity of great stories that we have to tell on topics including our farm fresh produce, local sourcing and the nutritional profile of our menu items. It's also a fun way for us to talk about the many other great things that we do as a company.  And when it comes to restaurant modernization, Europe has led the system in evolving the look of our restaurants. And this effort has clearly benefited our results in Europe and globally. Our reimaging work is complemented by a concerted effort to simplify the customer experience. One example of this is the contactless payment technology that is rolled out in the U.K. and Switzerland, and is currently being deployed in Italy and Poland.  I'd now like to shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, or APMEA, which delivered another strong quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter grew 5.2% and operating income increased 19% in constant currencies. The region's growth has been balanced with convenience, value and menu initiatives leading the way.  A sustained focus on the drive-thru and delivery service strategies is paying dividends as the top sales driver among convenience tactics in markets including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Another convenience is the nearly 1,700 dessert kiosks, many of which are in China, where disposable income becoming more widely spread these days, our kiosks provide a quick, convenient treat for loyal customers while also serving as a great way to introduce new customers to our brand.  And on the topic of menu, breakfast continues to deliver results. In China, the launch of a 2-item meal combo, featuring the new big crispy chicken muffin and coffee has driven early morning performance and contributed to more than half of China's total comp guest count growth. This daypart is approaching 8% of sales in China. And in Australia, a new breakfast menu that includes items like bagels has made it the region's strongest growing daypart. Now as all of you know, Australia has begun to feel some of the economic pressures that have been weighing in on much of the world these last few years. GDP contracted 1.2% in the first quarter, its biggest fall in 20 years. The cost of living and the level of savings are both high and also contributing to concerns is the high Australian dollar.  Recognizing the need to turn up our attention to entry-level value, our Australian team has launched the Value Lunch initiative. And it's similar to the one that we launched in China. Early results are promising.  On the topic of value, I'm pleased to report China's Value Lunch sales which offer an Extra Value Meal at a discounted price for a set period of time during lunch have grown by 20% versus the same period last year. Now on to Japan. A branded affordability platform in Japan at breakfast and a new Value Lunch initiative are driving sales and guest counts and growing our market share. I'd also like to provide a brief update on our operations in Japan. Our business there is holding steady. And today, all but 17 out of 3,300 restaurants are open. Our team is doing an outstanding job managing through a very devastating situation. Although Japan is starting its recovery, the road is still unclear as the country begins efforts to address summer energy consumption levels, measures like the rolling closures of manufacturing facilities and work week changes may impact consumer behaviors. As we move past the midyear point, we remain very confident in our strategies as we continue to work towards becoming our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink. At McDonald's, we deliver a great experience to our customers. We deliver high-quality food at a great value and an increasingly modern atmosphere. This continues to resonate with our consumers, and that's why McDonald's is a destination for more than 64 million customers each and every day. I'm confident that we will continue to grow our market share while generating sustained profitable growth for our system and our shareholders.  And now, I'd like to turn it over to Pete.\nPeter Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Through the first 6 months of 2011, the McDonald's system has remained focused on executing the Plan to Win strategy, and it's continuing to produce positive results. We are building sales, guest counts and market share in every area of the world despite a global economy facing rising costs and volatile consumer sentiment. Despite this environment, system wide sales increased 6% in constant currencies for the 6 months ended June 30, and we continue to strengthen our profitability with year-to-date combined operating margin up 30 basis points to 30.8%. Our franchise business model relies on the entrepreneurial spirit of the local businessmen and women who operate 80% of our restaurants around the world. For the quarter, franchise margins totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of $130 million in constant currencies, with every area of the world contributing. The margin percentage was up 40 basis points to 83.1% driven by positive comparable sales. Franchise margins drive approximately 2/3 of our restaurant profits.  Global company operating margin dollars grew $27 million in constant currencies to $891 million for the quarter, while the percent declined 90 basis points to 19%. Rising commodity, labor and other costs more than offset strong comparable sales. We are satisfied with these margins in this environment. For a perspective, at 19%, the 2011 second quarter margin is the second-highest of the past 10 years. In the U.S., company operating margins declined 150 basis points to 20.7% for the second quarter due primarily to 6% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs. The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 4% to 4.5%. The cost increases were partly offset by strong guest count growth and a 1% price increase in March and a 1.4% increase at the end of May. As we move through the year, we will continue to consider future price increases, balancing our desire to maintain growth in guest count and market share amidst rising input costs.  We remain mindful of food at home inflation, while striving to remain below from the food away from home index to maintain our strong value proposition. Food at home inflation is rising faster than food away from home, providing us some room to take more pricing in the current environment.  In Europe, second quarter company operated margins decreased 70 basis points to 19.6%, primarily impacted by 5% higher commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, higher labor and other costs. Europe's projected full year commodity cost increase also remains at 4% to 4.5%. Europe is a collection of 39 different markets, so our price increases vary by market, with Russia at the high end due to its significant inflation and all other markets averaging about 2% year-over-year. As we move to 2011, we will continue to evaluate pricing being sensitive to austerity measures and shrinking disposable income.  In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 17%, also reflecting inflationary pressures in commodity, labor and occupancy costs, offset by comparable sales increases. Similar to last quarter, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the segment's margin percent. In terms of pricing, APMEA is averaging about 3% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S. and Europe, we will continue to assess our pricing in an effort to alleviate some of the inflationary pressures while maintaining our guest count momentum. Looking forward, given our commodity pressures, we expect third quarter consolidated margin comparisons to remain challenging, with comparisons easing into the fourth quarter. G&A control remains a part of how we operate. Compared to second quarter 2010 which included our biannual worldwide convention, G&A spending declined $5 million or 1% in constant currencies. We remain on track for full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies. On the other operating income line, the current quarter benefited from gains on partnership dissolutions in the U.S., as well as comparisons to charges related to voluntary glassware recall last year.  With half the year behind us, we have tightened our full year effective tax rate guidance to 31% to 32%. Through June, the effective tax rate was approximately 30%, implying that both third and fourth quarter rates will likely be above the annual guidance range. Our strong operating results continue to generate significant amount of cash. Our first priority for this cash remains reinvestment in our business to drive future growth and returns. About half our CapEx is allocated to existing restaurants, with the other half to open new units.  As Don mentioned, modernizing the customer experience is one of the pillars of our growth strategy and reimaging plays essential role, refreshing our interiors and exteriors so customers easily notice the contemporary look and feel of our restaurants.  Equally important, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to enhance operational efficiencies such as adding dual lane drive-thrus, optimizing the spacing between the payment and present windows in the drive-thru or expanding the kitchen to increase capacity, to name a few. Through the first 6 months, we have completed 200 reimages in the U.S., and are confident that we will meet our target of 600 by year end. Our owner/operators are enthusiastic about this initiative and view it as a way to capture a sustainable long-term competitive advantage.  The other half of our capital expenditures is allocated toward opening new restaurants. Over half of the projected 1,100 openings or about 650 will be in APMEA, a key growth region for us. China has opened 66 restaurants through the first half of the year, and we'll finish the year opening between 175 and 200. Broadening our accessibility remains a key strategy for us in this region, and we see significant opportunity for new units for many years to come. Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translation which positively impacted second quarter results by $0.10. At current exchange rates, we expect third quarter EPS to benefit $0.07 to $0.09, with a full year benefit of $0.23 to $0.25. But as usual, take this guidance as directional only because rates will continue to change as we progress through the second half of the year. McDonald's results for the second quarter underscore the strong foundation from which we are operating: a resilient strategy that operates effectively in any economic climate; a powerful alignment of our system around the key priorities that widen our gap versus the competition; and an paralleled focus on execution that delivers a uniquely McDonald's experience to the 64 million customers served at our restaurants each day. We remain confident that this formula will continue to deliver strong results over the long term.  Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] So let's start with David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank: I have a question about your efforts to improve throughput and the effective capacity of your assets particularly in the U.S. I think it was last year, you said that the lunch hour same-store sales have been flat for 5 years, and correct me if I'm wrong on that. I know you made peak lunch hour staffing a priority at your conventions again about a year or so ago. And earlier in this call, you reminded us of new point-of-sale systems and I hear your reimaging has a sneaky positive benefit to throughput. So could you perhaps let us know, have you been able to restart same-store sales growth at the peak hours and perhaps give us a sense of how this might play out in the coming years?\nDonald Thompson: We definitely have had a big focus on peak hour, both from what we call peak hour capacity, so that gets into -- as you put it some of the staffing efforts, our staffing levels are up. As you all know, National Hiring Day in the U.S., we targeted hiring 50,000 people. Actual results are coming in at 93,000 people that were hired. And that's increasing our staffing opportunities also for, of course, dayparts but also for the peak hours. So we staffed up better. The new POS system, which is in 10,000 plus restaurants in the U.S., is also helping us from an ease of ordering perspective. And so we have been growing across all dayparts, but we definitely are growing at the lunch daypart as well.\nKathy Martin: Okay, our next question is Jeff Omohundro from Wells Fargo.\nJeffrey Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just was wondering if you could further address the sales and inflation trends in China, really in the context of the broader consumer environment, as well as how you are managing your daypart efforts on the value side.\nPeter Bensen: Jeff, we had a good quarter in China. Second quarter comps were up 14.4%, almost all of that driven by guest counts. That was on top of a mid-single digit comp last year in the quarter. So traffic and guest count movement, obviously, is very strong there. And key to that in the environment you mentioned, the high inflationary environment, is our everyday value. So our focus, as Don mentioned, I think it was late 2009 we introduced the Value Lunch in China. And now, a renewed focus on value at breakfast, with a RMB 6 muffin and coffee offering, and recently introducing a snacking value menu around RMB 7 and up from there. So, all efforts to drive traffic, yet that the same time, realizing that with input costs rising, we do have to do something to maintain our profitability there. So we did, in July, look at adjusting prices. And when you take some of the products that move to the value menu which effectively were price reductions with some of the other actions, it did net out into a net price increase. But early days, we're seeing no negative impact from that.\nKathy Martin: Next question is Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: [Technical Difficulty]  And what you have still sort of in the barn to come out as far as in the global markets, specifically some of those things that are working in the U.S. so well, the timing of that being rolled out on the international stage and some of your future things in the pipeline?\nPeter Bensen: Matt, we missed the first part of your question. It was cut off.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Okay, I was asking about the beverages. And I was curious if you could talk a little bit looking back how much it helped the comp but also what -- as far as products that are working so well in the U.S. What are still to come in the international markets, if you can give us a little bit of an insight into drivers without obviously tipping the hand of the competitors.\nDonald Thompson: The beverage strategy clearly has been working very well. Now the coffee side of that is being implemented in many areas around the world. And frankly, the coffee part of that started in New Zealand and Australia. We are very strong in Germany with a number of McCaf\u00e9s we have there. The U.S., they move forth with the overall beverage strategy, which is inclusive of espresso-based drinks. The frappes, the smoothies, pineapple mango, strawberry, wild berry, those are all products that are being looked at in other parts of the world. Many of the areas are looking forward to an implementation of those products. We do have to be cognizant of our supply chain and be able to make sure that we have ample fruit supply before we move into those, and our supply chain team is doing a great job of readying us for that. So we're looking at the smoothies and some of the other products for their applicability. But at the same token, some of the premium sandwiches that we've seen in other areas of the world. The U.S. team is looking at some of those, whether they be sandwiches like the McWraps or 1955, to basically augment the existing menu pipeline that's in the U.S. right now. So we've got a lot of great -- both from a beverage perspective and a sandwich perspective, snacking, Pete mentioned that, some of the desserts are really traveling around the world at a much quicker pace.\nKathy Martin: Okay, our next question is Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch: Could you talk about the month of June? It was extraordinarily good seemingly everywhere around the world. Were there specific initiatives in place in the U.S. or in Europe or APMEA that drove that very strong performance?\nDonald Thompson: In the U.S., yes, U.S. focused on nuggets, chicken nuggets with the new sauces. Also, we did have the benefit of the Pineapple Mango smoothie, Strawberry Lemonade. And those things really still comping on top of what we had last year, which was the introduction of smoothies. And so the U.S. did very well there. We also had the benefit of the price increase and actually the 2 price increases that have been taken and Pete talked briefly about those earlier. So we've had those benefits on the U.S. side. The continued focus on building capacity that was mentioned earlier relative to the peak really supported the business. In Europe, what we saw was a combination of the initiatives that they've had in place, combined with us continuing to monitor some of the commodity-based pressures, taking appropriate price increases. But we've had great sandwiches like -- I've mentioned the McWrap, I mentioned 1955 before, we mentioned some of our value executions with Little Tasters, and P\u2019tits Plaisirs, the whole SAS value campaign that we have in Germany. So we've got quite a few things that are taking place that really supported us. The other benefit that we had was there was a holiday shift in Germany, particularly it was across Europe, but in Germany particularly where in the month of May, we saw some negative impact from some of the shifts of holidays. We picked that up in a benefit in the month of June. So very, very solid performance, very, very solid guest count growth. As I mentioned earlier, continued momentum, and we're looking at July comps in range of 4 to 5 percentile.\nKathy Martin: Okay, our next question is Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.\nGregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: You had a nice acceleration in your China same-store sales. Your other big QSR competitor saw a nice acceleration. How much do you think was due to the industry, and why do you think it accelerated so much?\nDonald Thompson: I think, Greg, I think China clearly has -- we're seeing some growing disposable income there. We know that the Chinese government has really put in play their perspective of continuing to ensure that minimum wage growth at a rapid pace. And so we're managing that from a labor perspective, but at the same time, we see the benefit of that increased disposable income in terms of consumer purchasing power. And therefore, our appeal as a brand across the lunch program, the breakfast daypart, the initiatives that we've launched, our service initiatives, more drive-thrus in the marketplace, more restaurants in the marketplace, a stronger marketing voice, we made investments there. All of these things are coming to bear, I believe, in China. And we're seeing some really good momentum there and our team is very strong. I was over earlier this year, very, very pleased with the development plan and the process there. Very pleased with our operational execution. We're learning better and better how to start up new restaurants and do it at the rate and pace where we've got going now. So the Chinese team is hitting on all cylinders now.\nKathy Martin: And our next question is from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank AG: Just on the U.S. a little bit and sort of back half outlook. You guys had a lot of innovation on beverages, a little bit of breakfast this year. But can you talk about sort of the innovation pipeline for the rest of the year in the U.S.? Are we going to see some new food items in the somewhat near future?\nDonald Thompson: Jason, relative to the U.S., you'll definitely see some ongoing, some new things. What the U.S. has done extremely well though, and I'd have to say this, is the beverage implementation has been great. Strength at breakfast and the addition of oatmeal, along with advertising core favorites in breakfast, has worked well. They are looking at some other products that they could implement. Clearly, the Angus burger has continued to perform for us. But we've got some different products at are in different part -- different test around the U.S. Some burger test, a couple of burger tests that I think you guys -- we'll be able to tell you about it at some point in the future if the test prove out, I'm sure they will. I talked about garden wraps and McWraps from Europe. The U.S. is looking at those clearly. We've got a couple of other things in the dessert pipeline in the U.S. we'll be able to talk about, and ongoing innovation from a beverage perspective. We really lean on the U.S. for some of the beverage focus and innovation, and we look to Europe and have for some of that burger innovation, and we're seeing some really great innovation out of Asia in terms of chicken-based products and snacking. So all of those things combined together really are part of, if you would, our global menu pipeline. And you'll see some of those come through from a U.S. perspective.\nKathy Martin: Okay, our next question is from Steve West from Stifel Nicolaus.\nSteve West - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Don, real quick. Can you maybe give us an update on McCaf\u00e9? I think when you guys first started advertising this, I guess, about 4 years ago, you're talking about 125,000 per store. I think last year you said it exceeded your wildest expectations internally. Can you maybe talk about where you are now and where you think you can be either in absolute terms or on a percent of sales mix? Is there any reason to think McCaf\u00e9 can't be 10%, 15%, 20% of sales as consumers continue to learn about the McCaf\u00e9 initiatives and continue to use you as a drink destination?\nDonald Thompson: Well, it's a great question. I think that the team has done a really solid job of executing McCaf\u00e9. Well, let's keep in mind as well, a big part of the McCaf\u00e9 chain was really the improvement in our drive-thru layout and our drive-thru capacity. But now that we have, and we have an appropriate layout, we mentioned before that it would not only be espresso-based coffees, but we're moving to frozen, blended drinks. And then we said proprietary-based drinks. All of those things have played well. Iced coffee\u2019s still in the lineup. We have the products in the restaurant now to be able to do combinations of things. And I know that the chefs are looking at that and looking at more new products. We've seen some of those products in the potential pipeline here. And so I think it can continue to grow. From a percentile perspective, how high can it go, we still view ourselves as an underdog in the beverage category when it comes to frozen, blended beverages. And so for us, being an underdog is a great thing because we have an opportunity to take even more business in this regard. And we can do it at the speed of McDonald's. So the whole combination of drive-thru capacity is a big part of what we're able to deliver in this regard.\nKathy Martin: Okay, our next question is from Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I wanted to ask you, you had talked about one of the benefits of the comps in the United States for the price increases you put through, which if they flow through kind of implies very little elasticity. And I was curious if that is the right takeaway, that there's very little elasticity you're seeing right now to the price increases you're taking both in the U.S. and abroad? And whether you are seeing otherwise any pockets of different consumer behavior as prices go up?\nPeter Bensen: Michael, you know what, actually, we're seeing a pretty good reaction to the price increases so far. So the one that we took in the U.S. in March, I would say the flow through from that was probably above average of what we typically get on a price increase. Part of that I think is because we hadn't taken one in so long. And it's still early to read on the May increase, but based on our June results, we think that is also being accepted. And generally, that's been the case around the world. So we've been very cautious. We've used our tools, we've looked at all of the other indicators that guide us whether it be grocery store inflation or food away from home and what's going on with competitors and unemployment rates, et cetera. So we've been judicious, and I think as a result of that, we're getting good reaction and good flow through on those price increases. And in terms of is that changing consumer behavior per se, I would say no because we aren't seeing any dramatic spike in the usage of our dollar menus. That would be one indicator. If we raised prices and then suddenly saw a big shift down to Dollar Menu items, we're just not seeing that. So we're pretty comfortable with how we've gone. We'll continue to be judicious as we move forward to balance that guest count growth with those rising input costs.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: So the APMEA profits accelerated nicely this quarter, I think, versus prior quarters. My question is simply what is the contribution now of China to that business? Maybe you can talk about the total either dollar contribution or the percentage contribution of China. And also, can you compare their McOpCo margins to the McOpCo margin you reported at 17% for the quarter? You mentioned there was some pressure in the margin from development, maybe just talk about how much that pressure is?\nPeter Bensen: Yes, John. China still remains about 3% of our global operating income. So it's -- well, obviously, its operating income was up for the quarter. It continues to stay in that 3% range on a global basis. The margins for China are a little bit below the average that we report for APMEA, but they were up for the quarter. But there's no chance -- we've accelerated new unit openings. The new stores -- and this is not unique to China, but a new store tends to open at a lower margin than the market average. And then over a couple of years, as the comps build, then it gets to the market average. And that's what we're seeing in China. So we are actually, this quarter, the new store mix was less of a drag on the margin than it was in the first quarter. So it's a combination. We're starting to comp up again having fewer non-comp stores in the mix, as well as the performance of those stores improving.\nKathy Martin: All right, next question is from David Tarantino, R.W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just a question about the overall environment in Europe. Looking at your comps, they were very strong. And I think, Don, you mentioned that even the informal eating-out market there was flat, which is maybe better than you would expect given all the austerity measures that are going on. So perhaps, could you comment on what you're eating in the consumer environment? And is it trending better than you would have suspected at this stage? And sort of what are the puts and takes as you look at the back half of this year and into next year in that segment?\nDonald Thompson: Europe is still fragile, and I think we all know that. Unemployment, U.K. is at about 7.8%, Germany about 7.3%, France is about 9.7%. So we're still seeing some fairly high unemployment rates across Europe. And from an IEO perspective, it is interesting. If you look at some markets, you'll see IEO, from a growth rate perspective, has diminished. Other areas, it's very, very lackluster. Every now and then, you get a bright spot. You see that Russia is growing but still not at some of the historic rates, and that's due to austerity measures. So what you see -- what we see across Europe -- and it's also a mix in consumer confidence. So you look in the U.K., consumer confidence is eroding a bit, Germany is going up a little bit, France is fairly flat. So it's an interesting set of markets relative to all the economic indicators. For our business, as we move forward, we just continue to focus on being able to have, first of all, value at each tier, bring forward some new innovative news in terms of our menu, at the same time, make sure that from a convenience factor, we're there, and from a base value factor, we're right there for the consumers across Europe. And so right now, still a mixed bag, second half of the year. It depends upon to what happens with some of the additional austerity measures. Some of the markets like Portugal are looking at increased VAT. So it's -- we do have to continue to watch what takes place with some of the austerity measures, and make sure we're prepared from a value perspective and from an operating perspective.\nKathy Martin: All right, our next question is from Jeff Bernstein, Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Just a follow-up on the pricing and commodity front. It seems like you're now running in the U.S. roughly 2.4% price. In Europe, you said ex-Russia, running up 2%. Just wondering whether you could talk about -- I think you said food away from home still above food at home. I think that's in both regions. Is the 3% to 4% range that you guys talked about last call is that still realistic or necessary in terms of pricing as we look to the back half of the year? And perhaps, could you actually see margin growth with that level of pricing with COGS where they are? Which kind of feeds into the COGS where I guess the food basket you're saying is still unchanged, which we're happy to see at 4% to 4.5% inflation. I'm just wondering whether you think things are topping out there. And while you haven't locked in 2012, presumably, whether you think the 2012 basket in U.S. and Europe would be above, below or in-line with that 4.5 -- 4% to 4.5% range?\nPeter Bensen: That's a lot of them, Jeff. So our best estimate right now and I think the folks that focus on this are suggesting that food away from home will still grow in that 3% to 4% range for the year. So we'll keep an eye on that. Our goal would be to kind of be in that range, I think. But again, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to be judicious about this and continue to read not only what's happened with the price increases we have taken but what is the sentiment and expectation going forward. But it does feed into your second question. So we think for the year, our cost of goods, our basket is going to top out here in the third quarter, and that we see relief in the fourth quarter. The 2012, it's still too early for me to give you a number, but directionally, my guess is we would see the basket up again in 2012. I think the anomaly of having a large decrease in our basket that we saw in 2010, I'm afraid those days are behind us for a while. And so as we think about price increases for the rest of this year, and we also have to think about what is coming in commodity cost in 2012 and beyond, our suppliers are, as they always do, looking at the markets and putting on positions where it makes appropriate to help lock-in and secure some of that predictability to our pricing in 2012. But at this point, it'd be premature for me to put a number on that.\nKathy Martin: All right, our next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.\nMitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Can you comment on emerging markets? Let's exclude China for a moment. Do you have a general emerging markets strategy or is it just by region? And I guess, my direct question is, can you give us a sense of what your unit growth is for your emerging markets ex-China? And is there an increased focus on stepping that up? I think your global unit growth is about 1.5%. So I'm just primarily asking about the emerging markets piece ex-China.\nPeter Bensen: Mitch, in terms of our opening plan for 2011, of the 1,100 restaurants, roughly 150 of those are going to be in the U.S. Another 225 of those are going to be in Europe. 90 plus are going to be in Latin America. So regarding emerging markets, we're going to get nice growth in Latin America. And if you recall, that's a developmental licensee, so no capital from us for that. And then 650 in APMEA, so ex-China, let's say that's 450. Japan is going to give 100; South Korea, 30. There's a lot of the markets that are 20 plus whether it be in the Philippines, or Turkey, or Malaysia or Indonesia. So there are a lot of openings and growth going on in these markets that you'd referred to as emerging. So while it's not a strategy per se, our strategy is we're looking around the world for the opportunities to grow restaurants where we have good demand and we can get good returns. And so we're going to continue to do that.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies: In regards to beverage sales, I think I heard being up 29%, could you help us understand which dayparts benefit most? So assuming not every daypart was up 29%, but where did you see most of the increases?\nDonald Thompson: Nicole, it varies based upon the product. And so we see a great regular menu, regular daypart if you would, afternoon, later evening movement with products like the smoothies and the frappes. However, interestingly enough, we do sell frappes at breakfast, in the breakfast daypart and the smoothies [indiscernible], I mean, in the smoothies. But interestingly -- and our smoothies are skewed more towards the rest of the day like frappes are. Counter to that is the espresso-based coffees and our drip coffee in general. That's cued toward the morning daypart. Strawberry Lemonades, we continue to look at those products to see whether or not the buying habits change. But snack daypart, mid-daypart for those. Also add-ons in the early day. Our dinner daypart typically, the more indulgent based products sell at the dinner daypart. So we get a mix across the dayparts which is very, very good because it smooths the capacity impact in our ability -- helps our ability to deliver at the speed of McDonald's.\nKathy Martin: All right, our next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Just actually 2 on the U.S. I wanted to drill down. One was labor cost. I was interested that you mentioned, I think, pretty much across the board you did see some pressure on the labor line. Just trying to understand that, obviously, here in the U.S. the labor markets are still really flat. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? And then the second follow-up question was clearly, in the U.S., you're taking care from somebody. Informally, do you think it's coming from other fast food restaurants? Is it coming from full-service? If you could just give us a sense of where -- from whom you think some of your growth or on whose -- at whose expense maybe some of your growth is coming?\nPeter Bensen: Sara, it's Pete, I'll start with the labor question. The average rate in the U.S. was up just about 1%. So, not a huge increase, but certainly enough to have an impact on the margin a little bit. And really, as you noticed and mentioned, the unemployment rate, obviously, continues to remain high. But one of the factors -- the positive factor for us is that turnover is at record lows. So that's great for customer service, that's great for staff continuity. That does put upward pressure on the wages though. The longer the folks are there, the wages creep up a little bit. So it's that dynamic really, that part has the biggest impact on the wage in the U.S. And I'll let Don talk about where we're taking all the share from.\nDonald Thompson: Sara, I think if you look at some of the product introductions, you'll get a feel, really -- and that's the best way for us to really approach it. Beverages, we're gaining share clearly based upon the McCaf\u00e9 beverages. They've been growing at a really good pace. Also though, we're growing beverages on the value platform. So when you look at Dollar Drinks and dollar sweet tea, those areas, we're growing our business there. Breakfast wise, clearly, we're growing business at the breakfast daypart. Oatmeal has been a large incremental for us at breakfast. So we're getting the incrementality of an oatmeal. So where exactly those dollars are coming from, we haven't dissected that or really pinpointed from other competitors, we just know they're coming from the broader marketplace. And clearly, in the area of chicken with the success of nuggets, we grew our chicken business quite a bit. The other thing we're doing in the U.S. though is extending and expanding hours. And so we've gone from about 36% up to about 40% in terms of our 24 and extended hour operations. And so when you look at that, we're becoming more accessible. We are definitely getting in some of the product categories and we're improving our peak-hour service and our ability to satisfy customers during the peak periods where we have a higher flow through of customers. And so all of those things are areas where we're seeing some business gains.\nKathy Martin: All right, next question is from John Ivankoe of JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The question was on the self-order kiosks that you have, and I've actually have seen it in Germany. If you could remind me how many stores that's in? And just in terms of what some of the initial reaction has been from a customer perspective? In other words, is it driving average ticket? What its overall effect might be on throughput? How it might be affecting labor? And whether you kind of think that this is potentially a really big idea that you could use elsewhere in the system?\nDonald Thompson: John, relative to self-order kiosk, so France has really been our primary test market for self-order kiosks. We do have a few in some other areas, but the real key has been France. That's where we're really modeling out the benefit of self-order kiosks. It is not for every restaurant. It is one of those things that helps us pull traffic away from the front counter and helps us get basically another initiation point in terms of being able to place orders, which go back into the kitchen. And so that is what self-order kiosk has done. Now, what it helps some of the areas in terms of early read, it's that when you have an opportunity as a customer to be in a position where you're placing your own order, you take your own time. So if you're a person that takes a little longer or if you're a mom or dad with kids, they tend to like the ability to go at their own pace with a self-order kiosk. So those are the things that we're really testing. I think right now we've got about 700, 760, 770 or so in France and we'll probably stay around that number until we've really proven out the business case for this.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Keith Siegner, Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: I have a question. I'm very, very impressed with the Europe performance. It's very strong. And while it's kind of broad-based across the board contributions, the modernization and remodel is definitely, definitely part of this. And as you get closer to being done with that and have more critical mass, I'm just wondering are you finding better or worse sales list now that you have more critical mass and awareness? And is this more than just initial sales, let's say upon remodel, but now that you're really establishing critical mass, do you get more of a broad-based lift across the rest of the system? In other words is it a 1-, 2-year, or even 3-year lift you think as you get closer to critical mass? Just if you could help me think through that, that would be great.\nPeter Bensen: Yes, Keith, we know the reimaging is having a significant impact as you look around the -- but in Europe, by the end of next year, we hope to have 90% of the interiors done. But to date, we only have 40% of the exteriors done in Europe. So we do still have opportunity to continue there. And in France, which is probably our -- they were the leader in this area, they are looking at, I\u2019d call it second-generation of interior remodeling. So when they're essentially done, they're looking at what the next version of the reimaging. And the good news is the way it was done and the materials used and the way it was all put together, that second round of reimaging is much less expensive from a cost perspective. It could be just changing some of the wall coverings or some of the seating and you're able to get an updated refreshed environment without a significant capital outlay. But we're not really seeing a slowdown in terms of the impact when you do a new reimage relative to the marketplace. So it's still in that, let's say, 6% to 7% sales lift when we do a reimaging. And we aren't seeing that slowdown. So we know it's a great investment for today and for the future, and not only does it drive sales, but when you look at all the customer attributes, they tell us those services friendlier, the food is hotter, the restroom is cleaner. They give us a lot of credit in that reimaged surrounding that does help the brand halo and helps their intent to revisit us.\nKathy Martin: All right, next question is from Rachael Rothman, Susquehanna.\nJake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: This is Jake Bartlett in for Rachael. I just want a clarification on the pricing. I know in the past you've talked about say 2% to 3% in the U.S. I just want to see if that's still the case. I know you're talking about food away from home of 3% to 4%, and I think you mentioned being in that range. But just want to clarify on the pricing. The second question is about mix in the U.S. We know what pricing is. I'm wondering what happened to mix and maybe what that says about the consumer, whether the consumer is kind of trading up in the menu. I know beverages has a beneficial effect, but whether in the rest of it they're kind of moving towards more premium, higher priced items?\nPeter Bensen: Jake, we've said in the past that in what we call a normal year, a 2% to 3% price increase should allow us to maintain margins. And underlying that assumption is that we have a normal commodity cost environment. So that's commodity cost in that 2% to 3% range. And it's also assuming that 2% to 3% gives us -- half of that growth is coming from pricing and half of that is coming from traffic growth. So when years like now, we've got more of our growth coming from traffic, which means you need a higher comp, and we've got commodity cost above that average. So it's something more than the 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins in this current environment. And so obviously, we're going to -- as we've said before, we're not solely going to monitor the company operating margins and focus solely on growing that. We're going to look at that balance between continuing to drive customers, continuing to take market share with the need to cover some of these input costs. So that's our perspective on the pricing.\nDonald Thompson: And Jake, relative to mix, and Pete mentioned it earlier, we're still saying if you look across the menu board, so if you look at the mix between the value component products and the rest of the products that we have, those that are on Value Menu versus the rest, we're still seeing about a 10% to 11% in terms of the Dollar Menu if you add Double Cheeseburger in there, then it's up just a couple of points. So if the mix has stayed basically the same, now what's happened is we've got a lot more customers coming into the restaurants. So that part is good. We're still seeing a bunch of same mix there. Clearly, we're selling more beverages and seeing more of those kind of transactions, which is very good for us. But all in all, the mix is not varied that much. And I think the balance of being able to talk about core products and premium products like Angus, along with beverages, along with value has helped us to manage that mix.\nKathy Martin: All right, we have time for one more question. Next is Larry Miller from RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Maybe since I'm the last question, I'll slip in 2 if you guys don't mind. Just a quick one on the real estate ownership, can you give us an update there? That was something you were looking at as real estate became more attractive. And then secondly, let me get your thoughts on the premium burger segment in the U.S.? There's a lot more competition there. And your sense of how they're doing and is this any credible threat to your business?\nPeter Bensen: Larry, regarding real estate ownership, I think our desire in every restaurant opening is to own a real estate if we can do it at a reasonable price and get the unit economics to work. Securing that tenure forever and that occupancy costs forever is our goal. So in terms of 2011, we do have a greater proportion of purchased sites than we had in 2010, primarily in Europe where we focused a little bit more. I still say that our expectation was maybe we'd see a little bit more distressed real estate on the market or opportunity to buy sites that maybe we couldn't in the past. But we really aren't seeing that to a meaningful degree, so nothing dramatically different in that regard. We'll continue to focus. With our 2012 development plans are starting to come together, I expect we'll continue to see again increase in purchase size, but not dramatically different than our expectations.\nDonald Thompson: Larry, and on the premium burger question, and I'll speak of it from a U.S. perspective clearly as where you see more of the advent of more premium burger outlets, if you would, coming into the marketplace. And frankly, I think it's good for us. I think it's a benefit because those premium burgers have higher margin and we've got some of those same premium burgers. When there's advertising on those, we get a benefit. So we're able to do Angus now. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a couple of other things we're looking at in the burger lineup. Keep in mind, Europe has already tested the 1955 very successfully. Big burger, Big Tasty has been out. So we -- I'm really looking forward to us having even more premium burgers. We'll manage it appropriately from a price perspective and be able to deliver that, we think, at an even much more of a value proposition based upon our supply chain and the efficacy of it. But we'll also not only look at beef, we'll look at chicken. We're doing this around the world. And so our menu pipeline is pretty strong and we look forward to capturing even more of the market.\nKathy Martin: All right. So we are about out of time, so I'm going to turn it over to Don, who's got a few closing remarks.\nDonald Thompson: So I want to really thank everyone for joining us this morning. And in closing, I'd like to just reiterate our confidence in the continued strength of our business around the world is very strong. We're delivering solid results because the entire McDonald's system remains aligned behind executing our Plan to Win and focused on driving toward our mission to become our customer's favorite place in where to eat and drink.  We'll continue to focus on being smart and strategic in the current environment, as we've talked about today, while always striving to deliver the best customer experience that we can in each of our 33,000 restaurants around the world. So thanks again, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-04-22 17:40:15", "content": "Executives: Jim Skinner - Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee Cathy Martin -  Donald Thompson - President, Chief Operating Officer and Director Peter Bensen - Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Executive Vice President\nAnalysts: Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG John Glass - Morgan Stanley Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC Andrew Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Cathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nCathy Martin: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on the call are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner; Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen; and Chief Operating Officer, Don Thompson. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast.  Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are any reconciliations off non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. So now, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJim Skinner: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest quarterly results, which reflect the continued strength of our business. The first quarter worldwide comparable sales were up 4.2%. Operating income increased 7% in constant currencies, and EPS reached $1.15, a 12% increase in constant currencies.  And our success continues to be a systemwide effort. In the United States, comparable sales for the quarter increased 2.9%, while operating income declined 2% as it was negatively impacted by a 4 percentage point decline on our operating gains against 2010. Comparable sales in Europe rose a healthy 5.7%, and operating income grew 12% in constant currencies. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, comp sales grew 3.2%, and operating income rose 18% in constant currencies. The 2010 charge for Japan's strategic restaurant closings benefited APMEA's 2011 growth rate by 12 percentage points and the consolidated growth rate by 2 percentage points. And our momentum is continuing into April with our global comparable sales trending in line or better than the first quarter. These results are a testament to the continued relevance of our Plan to Win and its relentless focus on those five P's: people, products, place, price and promotion.  Now the economic climate is still less than ideal, from a slow and uneven recovery to significantly rising commodity costs and fragile consumer confidence. But we continue to succeed by staying true to our proven plans and listening to consumers. We're elevating our business to meet their needs in a holistic way with attention paid to each 1 of the growth priorities under our Plan to Win: optimizing the menu with right food and beverage offerings, modernizing the customer experience by upgrading every aspect of our restaurants from service to design and broadening our accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives.  Now it's not just 1 initiative but the combination of all of them that is driving our growth. This approach isn't revolutionary, it's evolutionary. We focus on improvements on top of an already strong and healthy base. The alignment of the McDonald's system around our global growth drivers and then scaling and executing against each of them is what will continue to grow our business and increase our market share.  In the area of menu, we're delivering results by focusing on our core offerings, which drives the majority of our business. At the same time, we balance this with new food and beverage news around relevant products that our customers want. We're tapping into opportunities to further build key categories, from chicken and beef to beverages and breakfast, and we're already in a number of billion-dollar brands, as you know, to leverage along the way. And with the benefit of shared learnings from markets around the world, we will continue to deliver a strong global pipeline for today and into the future.  In chicken, we've taken a well-known brand, McNuggets, and featured larger sharing portions with great success. In January, the United States drove double-digit sales increases in the product with their promotion of 20-piece McNuggets. While the U.K. launched the 20-piece ShareBox resulted in sales that were more than double in the initial projections. And Australia continued to see success with its popular new chicken bites, a smaller bite-size chicken offering. And they're testing several oven-baked chicken offerings as part of our efforts to keep innovating in that category.  Beef continues to provide opportunities with products like our iconic Big Mac and more recent additions like the Angus burger. Several markets celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Big Mac. And in France, the Double Cheeseburger continues to be a strong seller throughout the quarter.  Line extensions and locally relevant limited time offers continue to drive gains across the system. Europe has been doing this with great success, and our other areas of the world are taking the learnings and applying them to grow their business.  Japan hit the mark with its highly popular Big America 2 burger campaign. In February, the U.S. entered the Chipotle and Bacon flavor to its line of Angus burger and Snack Wraps, which drove total Angus burger sales to their highest rate in nearly a years and increased total unit movement by more than 30%. And this month, Canada is launching its new line of Angus burgers. U.S. is targeting additional opportunities for line extensions and limited time offerings in both beef and chicken as it explores the use of Artisan breads and a variety of toppings, and they're taking really a page out of Europe's playbook. Turning to beverages, we're in the early stages of leveraging this platform around the world. In the U.S., the winter months helped to boost our growing line of hot McCaf\u00e9 offerings with sales of specialty coffees increasing 17% from a year ago. The U.S. will build on this momentum with the launch of a frozen strawberry lemonade in May along with the new unique smoothie flavor this summer and a re-hit of the popular value drinks.  Beverages in the U.S. are a $146 billion business, and we have only scratched the surface on our opportunity there. Beverages are also important outside the United States. In China, we have more than 145 McCaf\u00e9s and in Europe, more than 1,350. And in other markets such as Canada and Australia, they're testing various products from the U.S. lineup of specialty coffees and blended ice drinks.  Now let me wrap up the discussion on menu with breakfast. In the United States, food news from the quarter was the launch of Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, which you all heard about, which strengthened our overall nutritional profile and gave customers another great-tasting, high-quality option not only at breakfast but all day long. And China and Japan, both made gains at breakfast through a combination of compelling value and focus on strong menu offerings. Now regarding Japan, our thoughts continue to be with the Japanese people as they work to put their devastation behind them and rebuild their country. Our business in Japan was certainly impacted and continues to face some challenges, although the effect on our overall income, as you know, is minor. Our foremost concern is to ensure the welfare of our people and then getting all of our restaurants back up and running. I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire McDonald's system for its support and everyone on our Japan team for all they're doing to help their people, their country and their business. So in addition to menu, we're driving gains by making our restaurants even better and more relevant for our guests. We're staying focused on improved service through training, technology and an unyielding commitment to operations excellence. All of this is helping to lift customer satisfaction scores across our system, especially in APMEA, with China and Japan continuing to lead the way in service and hospitality and Australia, which scored its highest customer satisfaction marks ever in January.  In addition, more than 70% of our APMEA markets have increased their peak hour guest counts through optimized operations and capacity initiatives. U.S. and Europe also achieved higher customer satisfaction scores, and Europe continues to make our dining experience more convenient than ever.  France and Southern Europe are equipping an additional 250 restaurants with self order kiosks to deliver a more convenient ordering experience, while the U.K. is bring a touch prepayment option to all of its 1,200 restaurants this summer, providing even greater speed and convenience for our customers. And the new, more user-friendly POS system that we've talked about is now in 7,500 restaurants across the U.S., and it's easing the job of our crew so they can spend more time on customer service.  We're also continuing to ramp up our systemwide reimaging efforts, with all areas of the world focused on making our restaurants more contemporary and in tune with modern demands and tastes. Australia and Europe remained out in front on this effort with the U.S. making progress and planning to complete 600 reimages this year. In Europe, we're targeting 850 reimages and another 500 in Asia. We continue to see the desired results from our reimaging with improved perceptions of our brand and higher sales differentiating McDonald's from the rest. Our brand, our business and our operators are all strong, making this the perfect time to invest in our future.  Finally, we're driving the business by continuing to make our brand more accessible and in step with how customers work and live. In the U.S., we're delivering greater convenience and accessibility through extended hours, which also continue to drive sales and guest counts. In APMEA, we're building on our convenience by advancing our dessert kiosks and delivery service in Korea as well as China, where each platform is achieving double-digit comp sales. And we're opening new restaurants in markets where the opportunity exists to strengthen penetration to expand our customer base including China and many countries in Asia, as well as Russia, France and Italy.  Meanwhile, we remain committed to value across our menu as consumers everywhere continue to count on McDonald's for everyday brand and affordability. In the United States, our Dollar Menu at breakfast continues to be a strong traffic driver. Our Dollar Menu the rest of the day remains a consistent highly valued platform for our consumers. Across Europe, markets have put an emphasis on everyday affordability, like the U.K. Saver Menu and Little Tasters that give consumers a wider range of menu and price options. And in APMEA, value remains an important part of our business with our popular Value Lunch program driving strong results in numerous markets.  Now those are a few highlights of how we have maintained our strength into 2011 and how we'll continue to drive success. Executing all these drivers and building the business for the long term is achieved through our world-class owner/operators, suppliers, crew and staff. Together, we're committed to supporting the restaurants that serve our 64 million customers every day, whether it's through our training classes in Hamburger University, which is celebrating its 50th year or by hiring new employees to better serve our growing customer base as we did earlier this week in the United States and Canada during National Hiring Days.  We also remain committed to our Plan to Win strategy as well as our philosophy of financial discipline and enhanced shareholder value. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry and a robust business that generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations in 2010.  After reinvesting in the business, we remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through our combination of dividends and share repurchase. And in the first quarter, we bought back 18.4 million shares totaling $1.4 billion and paid a dividend of $0.61 per share for an additional $635 million.  Now overall, I am pleased by our first quarter performance. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our entire system is aligned behind our proven strategies in delivering the very best customer experience every time.  And with that, I will now turn it over to Pete Bensen.\nPeter Bensen: Thanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Our Plan to Win strategy, with a balance across the five Ps, continues to deliver higher sales and improved profitability. Against the backdrop of tentative and uneven improvement in the global economy, systemwide sales increased 6% in constant currency in the first quarter.  Operating income reached $1.8 billion, up 7% in constant currencies, and combined operating margin reached 29.9%. The largest driver of operating income is our franchise margins, representing nearly 70% of consolidated restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margin dollars rose to $1.6 billion, an 8% increase in constant currencies with each area of the world contributing. Consolidated franchise margin percent rose 70 basis points to 81.9% as positive comparable sales more than offset cost increases. Before I turn to company operating margins, I wanted to provide some perspective on our updated commodity cost outlook and how we view pricing in relation to some of the increased pressures on margins. Since January, the global commodity markets have experienced significant increases. As a result, we expect additional pressure as we move throughout the year, especially in the U.S. We are seeing cost increases on virtually every item in our basket, with beef accounting for about 1/3 of the additional increase. Reduced herd sizes, increased demand and a weaker U.S. dollar driving up exports are all contributing to the increase in beef costs. As a result, our U.S. grocery basket is now projected to be up about 4% to 4.5% for the year with greater pressure to be experienced in the second and third quarters.  In Europe, our range of increase has narrowed as we now expect commodities to rise 4% to 4.5% this year. This is not significantly different from our previous guidance as many of the global factors impacting U.S. commodities are having a smaller impact in Europe. Our goal in managing our supply chain remains unchanged to maintain competitive and predictable pricing to the restaurants and ultimately to our customers. With our scale, infrastructure and relationships, we believe our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for the McDonald's system.  Balancing cost pressures with menu pricing and market share growth is not new to our system. We have successfully managed this in the past and are confident we can do so again. Considering the current inflationary environment along with the strength of our business, we believe we have some pricing elasticity. We plan to offset some but not necessarily all of the inflationary pressures with price increases, opting to take smaller increases over the course of the year to balance the impact on the consumer and our traffic. We look to keep increases below the \"food away from home\" growth rate, while also being mindful of what's happening at the grocery stores. Our demand-based pricing tool will guide the system in making the best pricing decisions for the business. Growing guest count and market share has been key to our success these past few years. Accordingly, in the current environment, we are willing to invest some margin in the short term to continue to grow our business for the long term.  Each area of the world has taken some price in 2011. In the U.S., we took a 1% price increase in early March and will likely take additional increases during the year. Across Europe, we have also increased prices by about 1% in the first quarter. In addition, when the VAT increased in certain markets, additional increases were taken to cover the tax with no net benefit to sales. Further price increases, while likely, will be balanced amidst the many cost pressures and austerity environment in this region. With that as a backdrop, let's discuss first quarter McOpCo margins. Global company operating margin dollars increased 4% in constant currencies to $736 million. Company-operated margin percent declined 50 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting positive comparable sales that were more than offset by higher commodity, labor and other costs.  In the U.S., our basket of goods was up nearly 1% for the quarter. This increase, along with small increases in many other costs including labor, contributed to a 90 basis point decline in company-operated margins to 19.5%. Despite some of the near-term cost challenges, all of which are manageable, our U.S. business remains strong, and we continue to see market share growth. Turning to Europe. The company-operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.2% as strong comparable sales mostly offset increased commodities and labor, including the increased social charges and Russia. Europe's grocery bill was up 3.7% in the quarter. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins decreased 50 basis points to 17.5% primarily due to inflationary pressures in labor and commodities, partly offset by comparable sales growth. In addition, the acceleration of new restaurant openings in China is contributing to the lower margin percent as they initially experienced preopening and higher labor and training costs just like all other markets. China's new restaurant sales and margins then grows significantly over time. We continue to get leverage on G&A spending, which rose about 2% in constant currencies. This increase was in line with our expectations, and we are on track for our full year G&A to decrease about 2% in constant currencies. Similar to what we have experienced the last few quarters, the earnings contribution from other operating income declined in the first quarter. With fewer affiliated restaurants and the majority of re-franchising gains behind us, we will not be recognizing the significant levels of income that we have in recent years.  As indicated in our February sales release, the first quarter tax rate of 28.8% was lower than the full year guidance due to a non-recurring deferred tax benefit related to our foreign operations. Our guidance for the year remains 30% to 32%, implying the subsequent quarters' effective tax rates will be at the high end of our guidance. We remain committed to building future returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through growing our business by adding new units and driving same-store sales at existing restaurants. We are on track to open 1,100 new restaurants this year, with 156 opened in the first quarter including 40 in China. Reimaging will be a key differentiator for our existing restaurants in the years to come. We see tremendous opportunity to update our asset base as only 20% of our exteriors and 45% of our interiors currently reflect a modern, contemporary look. This year, we plan to reimage another 7% of our restaurants or about 2,200 locations. We made good progress in the first quarter toward that goal. The U.S. completed almost 90 reimages and has over 60 sites under construction. We're on track to completing 600 this year and are expecting to do more in 2012. Europe continues to lead our reimaging efforts, particularly its major markets. Over 70% of our interiors have been reimaged with the remainder to be reimaged by the end of 2012. About 40% of exteriors have been reimaged, so we'll take another few years to complete those. We completed 100 reimages in Europe in the first quarter. Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which positively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. The U.S. dollar has recently weakened against most currencies, especially our four major currencies: the euro, pound, Australian and Canadian dollars. As a result, at current exchange rates, we expect second quarter EPS to be positively impacted by $0.06 to $0.07, with a full year benefit of $0.15 to $0.17. Please take this as directional only, because I know rates will change as we move throughout 2011. McDonald's first quarter results are a testament to our system's focus on the customer and execution against the Plan to Win despite a volatile and unpredictable global environment. That focus and execution is yielding long-term value for our shareholders and our system.  Looking ahead, our fundamentals are strong, our strategies are sound and our system is aligned. I'm confident our commitment to executing our plan will continue to deliver strong results.  Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Cathy to begin our Q&A.\nCathy Martin: I'm going to open the call now for an a list and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] So our first question is from David Palmer of UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank: Thanks, Cathy. A quick question on the U.S. business. It feels like the cold beverage innovation has been a bigger driver of your sales than hot beverages at least over the last couple of years. Even iced coffee, I remember it was sneaky big as a driver. And of course, you've had some hits as recently as last summer. It even looks like the seasonality of this beverage sort of lift has been a key reason for your gap to the industry numbers being wider in the summer than they are in the winter. Do you see it this way? Is this something that you continue to believe will occur with summer beverages perhaps widening your gap again?\nJim Skinner: David, this is Jim. Thanks for the question, and we're very fortunate this morning. We have the guy that initiated the combined beverage initiative in the United States in Don Thompson. And Don's going to respond to your question.\nDonald Thompson: Just a couple of things. 1 is I think as you look at cold and hot beverages, our goal has always been actually to have enough in the pipeline that we were able to be able to kind of mitigate some of the seasonality impact you've talked about. And we're still focused on the McCaf\u00e9 hot beverages. We did hot Mocha last year. I think the team's doing a solid job of advertising those. On the cold side, very astute in terms of the question, but there's other weapons in the arsenal there. So not only frappes and smoothies, which were really, really big hits, to your point, iced coffee, but also, don't forget the entire ice -- or the cold beverage movement in terms of dollar drinks, which typically are across the summer months. And so we've got quite a bit going on with those cold beverages. The U.S. also has quite an inventory in the pipeline relative to looking at things that are upcoming like strawberry lemonade. We've got another smoothie flavor that's coming out this year. So we've been able to be very successful, and it has helped the business tremendously. However, we also want to make sure we continue to stay focused on the hot drinks. Lastly, on the hot drink side, also we can't forget that the predominance of hot drinks is in drip coffee. And so we have quite a lot of business, clearly, as we've gone from just -- if you look at overall beverages in terms of the McCaf\u00e9, 2% several years ago when we talk to over 6% today.\nJim Skinner: I think the other thing, David, to think about and this is we have invested a lot in this, as you know, and even changed the footprint of the store relative to the McCaf\u00e9 offerings. And we have therefore provided the technology, equipment and capability to prepare these drinks, if you will, in a rather seamless fashion. And so -- and what I would say is that all of them are contributing at a level where we wouldn't think about changing the mix or taking anything off the menu.\nCathy Martin: Okay. Our next question is from Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nJoseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I want to ask 2 questions. First, if you could share with us what the China same store sales number was for the quarter. And then secondly, Pete, I want to go back to your comments to U.S. I believe you said the food basket in the U.S. in the first quarter was up only 1%, yet you had about 90 basis points worth of margin pressure on a pretty good comp. So I guess I'm wondering how that all gels together.\nPeter Bensen: Sure, Joe. First of all, we were talking before the call. We knew you would ask about the China comp, so we're prepared for that. 6.5% was the comp for the quarter compared to a 1.4% comp a year ago, first quarter. Regarding the U.S., the commodities were still the biggest -- it's a couple of things. 1, as I mentioned, we did a 1% price increase, but that was not until early March. And we hadn't done another price increase since late 2009. So we had no benefit from pricing, essentially, in the quarter. We did have the food cost pressure. And compared to the first quarter last year, we had, let's say, 150 basis points of benefit from lower food costs. Here, we had a 40-basis-point drag from the higher food costs. And then every other line item it seemed was going just slightly negative. So we had a 10-point hit from labor and a 10-basis-point hit from higher promotional costs, which were some of the Oatmeal giveaways and discounting. We had higher utilities, a little higher depreciation, a little higher snow plowing expense those first couple of months. We saw most of these other expenses higher in those first 2 months of the quarter when the sales were a little bit softer, and we didn't have a benefit from refranchising that we'd had the last several quarters. So predominantly, it was the change in food cost that was the biggest driver, yet we had a lot of these other small items that accumulated to the impact.\nCathy Martin: Our next question is from Greg Badishkanian from Citi\nGregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Great, thanks. Just kind of following up on the lineup for 2011 in the U.S. I mean, really solid -- you had a really solid lineup in 2010, and you talked about beverages. Are there some other kind of factors that might be able to help continue that momentum in 2011?\nDonald Thompson: Greg, this is Don. Actually, quite a few things that are in the pipeline, and 1 of the points too -- we've got quite a few questions relative to menu pipeline. Here's the thing that's really working well. We really have a global menu pipeline, and I'll talk about the U.S. pipeline here too. And as I talk about it, I'll talk about a couple other products that the U.S. is now looking at that are coming from overseas but also some of the products from the U.S. that are being exported overseas, because we've got a lot of traveling around. Right now, the U.S. is focused -- and you guys will see in the next, I'll say, in a short time, you'll see more innovation relative to the smoothie drinks. I think you probably already know. We probably talked about pineapple mango, and there's a strawberry lemonade coming up on the Beverage side. We've got additional nugget promotions. We've got the revamping of the chicken lineup in terms of the sandwiches that are there. The whole nugget piece has been phenomenal for us, and I know the U.S. is going to hit that again, along with the ongoing support in the restaurants, clearly, of Angus and the return of the Asian salad. So those are some the things that you're going to see in a relatively short period of time. If you look a little longer out, there's a few products, actually quite a few products, that the U.S. has in test, and we'll have to wait to see which of these make it to market. But everything from spicy chicken sandwiches -- we have some of those across APMEA. The U.S. is looking at those quite intently. There's a smaller product called McBites, a snacking-type product that we're testing over in Australia. Actually, it's rolled out in the market in Australia now. The U.S. is looking at it. Clearly, they're looking at some of the sandwiches like Chicken Mythic, Chicken Legend that we have from Europe just as Europe is looking at the fruit, the frappes and the smoothies. So there's quite a few things that are in the pipeline now. We had a discussion with U.S. team last week relative to the pipeline, and it looked solid.\nCathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank AG: Yes, thanks. Just want to get a little more color on the margin outlook, particularly in the U.S. I know you guys don't give specific guidance. But with the pressure this quarter within commodities picking up but then you've got some pricing coming in, I mean, would -- should we expect margins to get worse before they get better in the U.S.? Or do you think you have enough pricing and sort of maybe not some of these one-time or small items that added up in the first quarter for the rest of the year that maybe the margins won't get a lot worse from here?\nPeter Bensen: Jason, it's Pete. You hit on the 2 drivers, right? The costs are going to get a little bit worse, and we know we'll get the benefit of our March price increase along with additional price increases, benefiting some of those what I'd call one-time things that were a nuisance in the first couple of months won't recur. It will be challenging to grow margins in that environment. There's no question about that. I'm not going to attempt to predict if 90 basis points decline is going to be the benchmark for the year or not. But you've hit on the things we're focused on, which is what is going to be the price increase and how to best manage the costs. But at the same time, as I did mention, in this environment, the last few years, we've been very successful at driving guest counts, and we don't want to do anything on the pricing side that's going to dramatically change that, yet recognize that food away from home is projected to be up 3% to 4% this year. And so that's what gives us the opportunity to get some price. So we're going to balance all that. We don't just manage to the 1 margin number, but I think you've hit on the things that we're focused on.\nDonald Thompson: Jason, just to remind us too, we've had similar conversations in years past. A couple of years ago, I remember having similar conversations when we began to focus on guest counts. And the reality is we have continued to outperform the market, and we have outperformed all of our competitors in the space. And the reason for that has been because of the guest count growth and then at the appropriate time, being able to take price and leveraging the overall product mix. And last year, we were focused very heavily on menu and value. This year, the U.S. is beginning to focus a little bit more on some of the higher-margin products. So all of those things will go into the mix as we attempt to manage this even further throughout the year.\nCathy Martin: Our next question is from Rachael Rothman from Susquehanna.\nJake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Yes. This is Jake Bartlett in for Rachael. I had a question just on your view of the U.S. consumer. I think in the past, you've talked about maybe switching some promotional activity more towards the premium. And I'm wondering whether that's changed at all in the last few months, whether you think you're going to need to focus on value, whether the industry itself is just going to remain fairly focused on value for the balance of 2011.\nJim Skinner: This is Jim. We're not going to change our strategy around what we deliver to consumer on value. That's #1. Everyday affordability is a mainstay at McDonald's strategy regarding the menu, and the combination of all of the things that I talked about this morning is how we deliver consumer relevance. So whether it's the strategy around what we're marketing in that particular month or if the things that Don talked about, menu coming up throughout the year, some of those are standard process. So if you take value drinks for example and the proliferation of some of the new drinks, that's an annual thing and particularly, in the United States. And of course, we view the opportunity to add relevance for our consumers around all of these things. And so whether it's increasing the marketing around a particular premium item or everyday affordability and the balance around all of that, I think it's business as usual as we go through 2011, because not much has changed regarding the consumer in 2011. Consumer confidence took a dip in March where it had gone up in February, and the unemployment's just under 9%. And there's certain things going on in the marketplace that would lead you to believe that, as Pete mentioned, the consumer spending is expected to be up but not substantially different than how we've looked at the business over the last couple of years. It's a mix, and it's a balance, and we're pretty good at it.\nCathy Martin: Okay. Next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Just actually a couple of question to follow up about -- 1 about the U.S. and 1 about China. The U.S., I just want to touch on the announcement about the hiring that you've done, and part of the rationale seemed to be about more 24/7 and maybe building up service. Can you give any sense of whether this -- what kind of impact on comps or on margins we might expect to see from some of the initiatives that you seem to be hiring in support of? And then the other piece was on China. I noticed your 6.5% comp, which is obviously a very good comp but maybe a little bit softer than some of the other local competitors who were a little bit higher. Were you promoting more? Was there something about price there that maybe you were -- had a little bit less on price than some of your competitors? Thanks.\nJim Skinner: Well, Don just came back from that market, and I'd also like to have him chat with you about the issue of -- what was...\nPeter Bensen: National Hiring Day.\nJim Skinner: Oh, National Hiring Day. Sorry.\nPeter Bensen: Yes.\nDonald Thompson: Sara, first off, on National Hiring Day, the intent really for us was to be able to -- in a solid voice, be able to leverage the McDonald's strength to be able to put a call out in terms of employment. We thought it would be good for us as McDonald's. We do and have continued to hire through some of the economic downturns, but we also thought it would be a more unified way to get the message out that McDonald's is hiring. Our focus internally is on leveraging that labor to continue to help us grow the business. We've grown guest counts tremendously. And so we want to make share that we're able to provide the same level of operational excellence in the restaurants that we've been able to provide. Now relative to specific focal points, we are very focused on our peak hours and how we continue to build our business during the peak-hour guest count timeframe. So we'll leverage, primarily, labor for that. However, we're also extending and expanding in terms of our extended hours. So we're going to use the labor wherever we need it in the business. So that's what's happening with the National Hiring Days. Relative to China -- just came back from China. And I tell you, I was -- it's my third visit, and I was extremely impressed with our development strategies and extremely impressed with the talent we've brought on, some really outstanding new talent in the development arena. The training that we have going on right now as we accelerate for the new openings and we accelerate openings has been phenomenal. And these restaurants have opened up, and I saw quite a few of them in my 3 days across China, both in Shanghai, Beijing and even Tianjin. We are opening restaurants that look great and are operating at very high levels. So to do that, we've got to train our teams, and we train them in existing restaurants. And so we have an accelerated pace there, which is really working out well. In terms of things we do that others don't do, I can't speak to all that others do. I will say this: our 6.5% is based upon also a tremendous guest count growth not just taking price. And having said that, what that means is that we are building quite a bit of breakfast traffic. We're building quite a bit of lunch traffic with our value strategies. Back in November, we went to off of that strategy for 1 month and saw a little business dip. So we've gone right back to our value messaging around lunch and breakfast, and it's paying great dividends. And so will we take price in China? We will take price in China, have taken some price but not at the scale, possibly, of some others. And so we're going to continue to stay focused on guest count building.\nCathy Martin: Okay. Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays Capital.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you very much. Pete, just 1 clarification on your earlier comment and then a separate question. Clarification relates to the discussion on margins, and I think you said you got to make a conscious decision to invest some margin in the short term to grow the business in the long term. And as it relates to the U.S., it seems like you're running 1% of pricing now. You mentioned being cognizant in the food away from home being at 3% to 4%. So I'm just wondering, as inflation gets higher, what the detail is behind that kind of investing in the margin. Would you be willing to go a whole lot closer to that 3% to 4%? Or would you be cautious of that? And then the extra question is just on the European market. Entering 2011, it seemed like everyone's focus was on austerity measures and how that would negatively impact everyone there including yourselves. Meanwhile, you're now running a 5% plus comp. So I'm just wondering is there anything you're seeing across the menu or across day parts. Or have you changed your promotional campaign? It just seems like -- just any color in terms of how you've been able to put up those type numbers, whether there's more and less resilient type markets. Any kind of color would be great. Thank you.\nPeter Bensen: All right, Jeff. In the U.S., the food away from home, the trailing 12 months through February is up about 1.5%. The 3% to 4% was the full year projection. I think you knew that but just to clarify. So historically, what our lesson tells us is getting ahead of food away from home is bad for traffic, but staying at or just below it is kind of the optimal place. So we're going to continue to watch that as we move throughout the year. It's 1 of the inputs to our pricing. This is really more of an art than it is a science, but it definitely is an input that we're going to keep an eye on, as well as, like I said, what's happening at grocery stores and food at home and gas prices and some of those other things. But it will be a guide for us as we move throughout the year. Regarding Europe, we have not seen any significant change in consumer behavior as a result of some of the austerity measures going on. U.K., for example, they had the 2.5% VAT increase and some other austerity measures in the country. They ran nearly a double-digit comp for the quarter, very strong sales momentum and guest count growth. And across Europe, the strategies have been very similar in the first quarter to what we had in 2010 and prior: promotion of premium products, rotating food events, at the same time hitting everyday affordability with the equivalent of their Dollar Menus and their mid-tier menus, the fourth tier. It's been, again, a combination that has been relatively consistent this first quarter relative to 2010, and we're cautiously optimistic that, that environment will continue for us.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research\nMitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks very much, and my question is for Pete. And I know no one has a crystal ball, but 3 months ago, your U.S. food cost outlook was 2% to 2.5%, and I think it sounded like you had pretty high confidence in that. And then even 3 months before that, you had high confidence in a 2% inflation forecast. Now 3 months later, that food inflation forecast has doubled. And just wondering, as you look back to the past 3 months, what was missed in that forecast. It seemed like a lot of folks on the sidelines were maybe ahead of that, because we do want to have confidence in your food cost outlook going forward. So maybe what was missed over the past 3 months? And how much confidence do you have in the U.S. food cost basket outlook of 4% to 4.5%? Thanks.\nPeter Bensen: Mitch, it's nothing that was missed in the outlook in January. It's actually the events that have happened since then that have dramatically moved all the markets from floods in Australia, which were impacting the beef market; to the unrest in the Middle East, which has driven oil to over $110 a barrel; to release of the grain stock inventories, which are at all-time lows; to the weak U.S. dollar, which has driven beef exports up over 30%. It's been all of these factors that have impacted, to a significant degree in the course of just 3 months, virtually every item in our basket. So our supply chain had great visibility into matters at the time when they gave the forecast, and several significant things have happened, none to offset. So everything going in the direction of higher costs, and I would be surprised, as you listen to other companies, that they aren't also up there updating their guidance as I've already seen a few of them do.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from John Ivankoe from J.P. Morgan\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Great. Thank you. Just a couple of follow ups if I may. First is on the point-of-sale system. I think you said 7,500 is in the U.S. I wanted to get a sense how many company stores that's gone in and what the experience has been when that system is changed, whether there's any integration cost short term and what the cost benefit is after that integration. And then secondly, Jim, I think in your remarks, you did say that you're going to keep value. But I do wonder, especially with some changes competitively, whether you could perhaps change some tactics around value, perhaps changing products or maybe even price points given the current commodity environment and what might be a slightly easing competitive environment and price in the U.S.\nJim Skinner: John, thanks for the question. I'll let Don talk about the POS system in a moment. But relative to value, we -- we're capable of changing our tactics around that and have over time. You go back to the Double Cheeseburger and then to the McDouble and some of those other kind of things. But on a wholesale basis, relative to providing everyday affordability both in terms of the Dollar Menu now in the United States, the Eurosaver in Europe and various markets and those other kinds of things, the fundamental premise of that is not going to change. And yes, you've seen over the years that different menu items have moved on and off the Dollar Menu here in the United States. But on an overall basis, the expectation is that we will stay the course on the underlying everyday affordability without a whole lot of shifting in that regard.\nPeter Bensen: And John, as a perspective, before Don talks about new POS. Even with these cost increases that we're seeing this year -- that brings our commodity cost really just back to 2009 levels. So the input cost for those items is very similar to what it was 2 years ago. So although it's high this year relative to last year, it's not at an unprecedented level.\nJim Skinner: And our franchisees who I talk to and stay in touch with on this, obviously, they're our #1 constituents relative to the success of the brand, and they lead the charge. We're 80% franchised around the world, 89% in the United States. And they all are supportive relative to how we need to go after everyday affordability and stay the course regarding that at least in terms of my last few conversations that I've had with them. And I don't think that will change, because they are just as concerned about maintaining guest count growth that we've experienced over the -- and they know that's the driver of our success over the long term and their success.\nDonald Thompson: John, relative to the POS system, it is in all of the company-operated restaurants now. It allows us to do several different things, some of which you've seen, whether that be operational ease in the drive-thru; dual drive-thru lanes; hand-held order taking, which we're beginning to implement more and more the restaurants, which help with operational ease and speed of service. And also, I think, John, you may have been in 1 of the restaurants. I can't remember, but to see us actually -- or see a crew person actually go through the ordering process, they have to use far less screens now as they're taking an order, which means that the speed of service time is being decreased. All of these things help us, again, at peak hours, so we have a higher level of capacity to move more customers through. And they're enabling us to be able to drive some of the guest count numbers that you guys have seen.\nCathy Martin: All right. The next question is from Larry Miller from RBC.\nLarry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Yes, thanks. I just had a couple of clarifications and follow ups. Pete, when you were talking about challenging to grow margins, I think you were referring to McOpCo, is that correct? In theory, as long as your potential sales are growing, your franchise margin should continue to expand?\nPeter Bensen: Franchise margins, as you know, are insulated from the commodity costs. So we get a lot of leverage from growing comps there, yes.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndrew Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks. Question on -- just back on China. I know it's not a huge part of the business, but within the overall context of APMEA, are the opening costs, is that ongoing through the year with the acceleration? And then the VAT, how does that jive with just inflation in wages and commodities over there? Is that going to -- is that big enough, I guess, to weight on the overall APMEA margins for the year?\nDonald Thompson: Andy, this is Don. We -- at this stage of the game, there was a time when we were actually behind in terms of the wage rate game, and we were trying to catch up. As you know, the Chinese government has determined that they want to double wages by the year 2015. At this date, we're above -- actually, we're double digit above the actual wage rates now and the way that they're planning on increasing. Part of the reason for that is to be able to: 1, get the kind of people that we want to have in the restaurants and the right talent. And so as we move through the year, we don't see this -- what's happening is as we accelerate the sites, clearly, we're training more people. At some point, we'll get to a steady state, but right now, we're accelerating our growth. We have an inventory and a pipeline to build a lot more sites. This year, we're targeted, as we've said, to do between 175 to 200. When I was there, I had a chance to review many of those sites with them and look at the trading area surveys, fantastic sites that we have. The challenge in China -- and it's not as much a challenge as it is really a business planning piece. And that is we go into many of these preplanned master plan communities about a year to 1.5 years ahead of time so that we can get a good, stable footing. So what we're seeing is -- so our first year sales are a little softer. Second year sales, we're seeing double-digit comps, which is exactly what we've seen historically, and those comps remain strong in the third year. So the development strategy right now is how we can manage the margins relative to labor, and we're in a really good position. Some of the other folks in the marketplace are trying to catch up to the position we're at. There will be another wage increase coming up soon in China. It will not impact us as much as it's going to impact others.\nCathy Martin: All right. Next question is Keith Siegner from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Thanks. Just a question for you on the franchisees. And really, what it relates to is over the last couple of years, you've done a tremendous job of taking market share while at same time expanding margins. So getting the franchisees, your large part of the system, to follow the lead of the company was really easy. Well, in the first quarter, for the first time, this program of like using a little margin to take some market share actually required to use a little margin to take some market share. And now with some acceleration in the inflation outlook, what I worry about here is this great opportunity to continue these market gains, facing increasing inflation, will the franchisees follow the lead? Do you feel confident that they will follow your lead and stay kind of below that \"food away from home\" pricing level? Or have they started to push for maybe more pricing or some change in strategy? What's their response to the actual use of margin for the first time?\nJim Skinner: Keith, this is Jim Skinner. Thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's very important to understand how much we collaborate with the leadership of the franchisee community regarding our strategies from everything from how we execute at the front counter and drive-thru operationally, customer satisfaction expectations and all the way through how we market to the business and how we communicate to the business and as well as what we decide to do around everyday affordability, as I mentioned earlier. And that collaboration has served us so well over the last number of years, and they also understand 1 thing: we are in this business for the long haul. So whether you're talking about China and some investment in the margin to grow the business over time, it's a long-haul view. It's not a quarterly view. It's not a 12-month view. Our franchisees are in the business for the long haul, and they are onboard relative to our strategies around this and maintaining guest count growth. Now that doesn't mean that you don't have people out there that are stressing and concerned just like we are in the company. But for the most part, they follow the company lead on the pricing and the expectation, company lead, meaning McOpCo. It's not about -- we have skin in the game in this issue as well. As we start thinking about taking margin, most of the time, that is in regard to how we price in McOpCo, but the franchisees typically follow our lead regarding that. And I see nothing out there relative to where we find ourselves in the business today, which -- yes, we've got some headwinds, but just like in another 6 months, we may have some tailwinds. And our consistent approach relative to how we manage the business and collaborate with the franchisees over the long term is a great benefit to our growth as a business.\nDonald Thompson: Keith, this is Don. And just a little texture to Jim's point and having lived through this from 2006 as the President of U.S. just up until last year. 1 of the things to keep in mind, and Jim has said this repeatedly, but we really have a lot of ongoing collaboration with the franchisees. There's a standing value team as a part of our op-net organization. They continue to look at pricing on our value menus, margin, operating cash flow in the restaurants. We also have a supply chain management collaboration with the franchisees. So they're up to speed on this ramp-up in terms of commodities. As it ramps up, those teams will give feedback to the overall system, and that's in conjunction with our own folks. So these are not once-every-quarter meetings. These folks are meeting on a routine and a frequent basis. Also, our cash flows have been strong. This is not the first time we've been through this, 2007, part of it, 2008. We've seen commodity stresses and pressures before. Each time we have, we've gotten together to focus on what are the most critical things to make sure we manage the business for the long term. So these are some more commodity pressures, but to Pete's point, it was the same thing we saw -- we're at the same level that we were in 2009.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from John Glass for Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. First, if I could get Pete just to clarify 1 thing and then I've got a question on the remodels. As it relates to just your outstanding commodity guidance of the 4% to 4.5% in the U.S. specifically, what assumptions are you still making? In other words, is it assuming a certain level of commodities flat or up from here? And what -- which ones are you assuming just so we know how to track that going forward? That's the clarification. And then just thinking about how we can get out longer term, sort of your pricing power mix shift, in the remodels you've done in Australia and Europe, have you seen favorable mix shifts in those versus the existing units? Have you tried to take more pricing in those units versus existing? Does it give you more pricing power? Or do you have actual data that suggests you have more when you remodel restaurants? Thanks.\nJim Skinner: Can I just...\nPeter Bensen: Sure.\nJim Skinner: Let me talk about the pricing power relative to reimaged restaurants. And I go back to many, many years ago when we used to think that because we had a modernized restaurant, that because we had ferns and grass that we could take an extra $0.05 in the big sandwiches or do whatever, because our customers would understand because of that wonderful environment that they're in that they ought to pay more for the sandwich. And that was a mistake, and we don't do it that way. The modernization of our restaurants really does not give us additional pricing power on the menu. And we do it because our restaurants either need to be re-modernized, or they're going to be built in a contemporary manner, but it has little to do with overall pricing power.\nPeter Bensen: And regarding the commodity outlook, John, we don't get into the individual line items with you and things like that. I think it's fair to say now, compared to where we were in January, we have more secured positions. So we have more hedges and things like that in the supply chain, but look at -- follow the markets today. I mean, this is reflective of what's happened in the commodity markets over the last 3 months, really, on several small unhedged positions. And so if the commodity markets move significantly from here and the main ones, obviously, looking at beef, looking at corn, wheat, coffee, et cetera, our guidance reflects where the markets are today. If they stay around these levels, the 4% to 4.5% should be locked in. If they move dramatically up or down then we'll have to reflect that as we move foreword.\nCathy Martin: Next question is from RJ Hottovy from Morningstar.\nRonald Hottovy - Morningstar Inc.: Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up question with regard to the pricing strategy, and appreciate all the color you've given us on that particular topic. Knowing that you're no stranger to a rising gas price environment, I just wanted to get your thoughts about how you're think about that with respect to pricing in the back half of the year, if it changes, what particular area of the menu that you might be increasing prices on and just how that plays into the strategy.\nJim Skinner: First of all, RG -- RJ, sorry, we always look at this, and I've already said it. You can't go far, you can get to McDonald's. We're convenient. And we went through this 1 time before, gas price was up over $4. I forget what year. It was just a couple of years ago. And really, it didn't have substantial impact on our overall business. Some of the interstate sites and some of the road stops sites had some small impact, but on an overall basis, it wasn't a major impact. And relative to how we look at pricing around that, that specific item is just 1 of other -- 1 more nick relative to the spending that consumers have. And so it's really molded in or melded in into our overall pricing philosophy. Don, do you want to say something else about that?\nDonald Thompson: I think, Jim, you said it. The only other aspect of it is -- and that's the reason we have the Value Menus that we have, so that if discretionary income begins to become impacted, we have opportunities for customers to still be able to visit McDonald's.\nCathy Martin: Okay, great. We are just about out of time, but we'll have a couple of last questions, 1 from Steven (sic) [Steve] West from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nSteve West: Yes, Don, can you talk about kind of the McCaf\u00e9? You started to roll out kind of second generation products now. 1, as you test it -- you don't have to give us specific results on frozen lemonade, but just what have you seen as far as cannibalization rates with the new products you've been testing? And 2, looking at McCaf\u00e9 in the future as you roll out new products, how much capacity do you have to continue to put new products on that same system? And do you start pushing kind of the envelope there as far as your operations?\nDonald Thompson: Steve, we actually built the -- I mean, as you all know that, the big part of McCaf\u00e9 was us to build out that sale in the restaurants so we have higher capacity. And we also had a strategy at that time of moving from the coffee-based drinks to the blended ice drinks to proprietary blended drinks, which is exactly where we are now. We're looking at strawberry lemonade and others in terms of the pipeline. And so capacity wise, we're in really good shape. It's the reason that we did the build-outs of the sales and also to help us in drive-thru speed. And then pipeline wise, we're going to continue to look at proprietary blended drinks and more of those, continue to look at things that we can do. We've got dairy in the restaurants. We've got coffee in the restaurants. We've got fruit in the restaurants, fruit purees in the restaurants. So we're going to continue to combine those, and the chefs are working on other blended drinks there. Lastly, McCaf\u00e9 beverages -- the McCaf\u00e9 average check is higher than our other average checks in the restaurant. And when you look at McCaf\u00e9, it's always a trade up when that drink is purchased. So we feel real good about the ongoing progress that we have and opportunity in McCaf\u00e9.\nCathy Martin: Okay. And our last question is from David Tarantino from RW Baird\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just another question on the pricing front. I hate to beat this to death, but I just want to understand, are you concerned about your pricing power for the McDonald's brand in this environment? Or is this approach that you're using 1 more of trying to balance pricing with the opportunity to maybe take some share relative to competitors?\nJim Skinner: No, I don't think, David, that we're concerned about our pricing power. And I want to just reflect on the question about when we reimage the restaurant, whether we have more pricing power. What we have is an opportunity to serve more customers, because we increase the capacity typically, whether it's the drive-thru or whether it's the service and the technology capabilities in the restaurant. And so I didn't mean to say that we don't have opportunity to grow the business. But it doesn't reflect directly on our ability to tell someone, \"Well, look. You're in a reimaged restaurant now so we get to price -- raise the prices.\" Our pricing elasticity in the brand moves up and down based on inflation, consumer spending, consumer confidence, all of those things that we have talked about many times before, and we're not worried. We have the capability to take price over this next number of months in the U.S., as Pete and Don have talked about. It's just a matter of timing and when it makes the most sense for us, always keeping an ever vigilant eye on everyday affordability, which is the most important thing for our consumers. I've said it many times before. They get pinched everywhere. They should not suffer the same fate at McDonald's. So this look that we have at food away from home and even food at home and paying attention to that relative to the long-term credibility with our customers and pricing. It's the most important thing that we do. And so the answer is no, we're not worried about that elasticity or that pricing power. We're -- but we're -- what we pay very close attention to it in the overall mix of how we decide to price going forward. And we never pass on directly all of our costs to the customers.\nCathy Martin: Great. So thanks for all your questions. I'm going to turn it over to Jim, who has a few closing comments.\nJim Skinner: Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize the ongoing strength of our global business and our confidence in the continued success of our brand. We're focused on smartly and strategically managing the market forces around us while relentlessly working to serve our customers better. Our fundamentals and Plan to Win strategies are strong, and I'm optimistic that we can continue to drive results in any environment moving forward. Thanks, and have a great day."}], "2013": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2012, "date": "2013-01-23 15:47:05", "content": "Executives: Don Thompson - President and CEO Peter Bensen - EVP and CFO Tim Fenton - COO Kathy Martin - VP of IR\nAnalysts: Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co.

Bensen:\nKathy Martin: Our next question is Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. Actually I do want to follow up on the question on the Dollar Menu comment. Basically, you're going more towards value. Obviously, we've seen mixed results in some of your markets. I mean, I think there was a comment about how Japan \u2013 the fact that ticket was really under pressure, Australia was obviously more successful with that. Is there -- I guess could you help calibrate why that might be the case and in the US, would you expect to see as you get more innovation on value and more marketing spend, would you expect to see that pressure on average checks like you did in Japan?\nDon Thompson: Sara, just to clarify, we don't expect to have a tremendous amount of innovation around bringing a lot of new products into the Dollar Menu unless they're going to be favorable from a profitability or margin perspective. So, when you saw the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger, that helped us in terms of the overall offset of margin. So, I wouldn't look to see a lot of new Dollar Menu-based products. What we want to see is a stronger balance relative to the entree-based products. So that's what's happening in the US. It is not going to be -- and as I've also heard that we are focusing more on Dollar Menu. Yes, more on Dollar Menu, but not more on the overall value perspective. The expenditures are similar, but we are focusing on a core equity that we have. Relative to Japan, that's a slightly different strategy. I'll let Tim talk a little about what we've done in Japan.\nTim Fenton: In Japan, Sara, coming off some intense promotional activities we had in celebration of the 40th anniversary of going into Japan. We're trying to get away from a lot of the couponing they were doing. It's been flooding the whole marketplace from all of the IEO industry to be more strategic and more of a branded value. So we've got a little growing pains there right now, but we think it's the best for the brand. We're seeing it resonate with our core products and again, we're still gaining in our market share. So, yeah, we have a little tough time going through this next couple of months, but we think long-term it's the way to reset our business.\nKathy Martin: Your next question is from Nicole Miller Regan from Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if we could shift the conversation over to the human capital angle, because you've talked a lot about the marketing and menu tactics and strategies. With some of the shifts that you have had in the past year or so at the executive level, would you look at this as an inflection point and what changes do you think could be a result of those new dynamics? Thank you.\nDon Thompson: Hi, Nicole. I'm going to assume, Nicole, you're talking about the shift that we had in the U.S. in leadership relative to Jeff Stratton and Jan Fields. One of the things I'd say first and foremost is, Jan was a solid leader for us at McDonald's and did an outstanding job in the U.S. business. When we looked at the results and where we wanted to take the business, we made a decision to move forward and make a leadership change. Jeff Stratton is a seasoned veteran with McDonald's. One of the things that Jeff brings is a global exposure relative to markets around the world and some of the things that they have done quite differently to enhance things like our menu pipeline. Jeff also brings a lot of operations experience as he was the head of our Restaurant Solutions Group relative to our capacity and productivity in the restaurants. And so the change that we made was a change that we saw as most appropriate for our business and we needed to be able to continue to move forward. I think his relationships with the franchisees is very solid, as Jeff at one point was one of the divisional presidents in the U.S. and so he set the ground running with collaborating with the operators, our marketing changes and enhancements that we made going into the next year and we feel very good about the prospects of where we're headed in the U.S. business.\nKathy Martin: All right. And our final question will be from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JPMorgan:\nDon Thompson:\nTim Fenton:\nKathy Martin:\nDon Thompson:\nKathy Martin:"}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-10-19 13:30:03", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin \u2013 Vice President of Investor Relations Don Thompson \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer Peter J.

Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on the call are Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson, and our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Both of those documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, along with any reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that are mentioned on today's call with a corresponding GAAP measures. Now I'd like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. McDonald's is the destination for more than 69 million customers everyday, because we offer great tasting, high-quality food, and increasingly more modern and contemporary restaurants. We remain focused on being the most appealing choice for our consumers and because growth in the global informal eating out category has been relatively flat growing share in our major markets is key to our long-term success. I\u2019d like to discuss our latest results and provide insight into how we are approaching our business in the current environment as we manage for the long-term. For the quarter, global comparable sales were up 1.9%, operating income was flat in constant currencies, and EPS reached $1.43, which is a 4% increase in constant currencies. And as we begin the fourth quarter, global economies remain challenging and our comparable sales for October are currently trending negative. We continue to face pressure on both the top and bottom lines some of which is the result of planned strategic decisions, including actions taken to enhance our value platforms, investments in technology, and our Olympic sponsorship. But other pressures have been driven by the external environment including declining consumer sentiment, higher commodity and labor cost, and heightened competitive activity. When the economic crisis began in 2008, few people thought the environment would still be as uncertain and fragile as it is today. It is clear however that this operating environment is the new normal. As such, our near term focus is on stabilizing and growing traffic and market share. We have been and continue to refine our efforts to increase frequency and penetration by addressing local market conditions. Our underlying strategy still revolves around a high-low approach that provides exceptional value across the menu at an affordable entry point and the bills on that foundation by offering premium products and offers that encourage trade up and higher average check. Now, given the broad based softness we\u2019ve been experiencing, I want to share some of the tactical adjustments that we are making to better align our actions with this new normal environment in our key markets. And although as we mentioned in the past, there is a lag between when these adjustments are executed and when we see impact on our results, we have already seen some improvements in several major markets. We are confident that these adjustments sustain the course with our three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility will deliver sustainable results long term. So let\u2019s start with the U.S. where comparable sales increased 1.2% for the quarter and operating income decreased 1%. Sales in the U.S. were driven by a combination of breakfast and beverages, a focus on our core menu as well as support for all-day everyday value at both the national and local co-op levels. The informal eating out industry has grown slightly in 2012 and is predicted to be flat in 2013. And the competitive set has increased its activity pressuring our share in recent months. The U.S. has taken steps to further strengthen its plans for the remainder of 2012 and is working to address the changing needs of our customers in our 2013 plan as well. We are focused on ensuring our value offers are supported by strong advertising. Beginning in mid-September for example, we increased our share of voice around the dollar menu, specifically featuring the McDouble and the extra value of our daily double beef sandwich. Looking forward, we will be adding additional support for the dollar menu platform. We\u2019re balancing our value messaging with premium menu news, including this month\u2019s introduction of the Cheddar Bacon Onion sandwich, which is made with hickory-smoked bacon white cheddar cheese, caramelised grilled onions and creamy mustard sauce on top of a grilled or crispy chicken patty, or our Angus beef patty. The CBO as we like to call it was inspired by a similar entry in Europe. This is the first time we\u2019ve offered one sandwich with a choice of chicken or beef in the U.S. and we've seen that both have a high rate of extra value mill conversion and average check increase in our test markets. And in December, we\u2019ll bring back the popular mackerel sandwich nationally. Local markets also continue to focus on beverages in an effort to generate additional consumer excitement. About 6,000 restaurants have continued to offer $1 soft drinks and many are offering our Premium Roast Coffee for $1. And just last month, most of our restaurants on the East Coast had free coffee events to celebrate our customers drive awareness and generate trial of our great Premium Roast Coffee. We are also building on our foundation to deliver future growth and continuing to make it easier for our customers to make more informed choices when they visit our restaurants. We\u2019ve long had nutrition information available online and in our restaurants through trade liners and brochures. And last month, McDonald's USA announced that it has voluntarily posted calorie counts for all national menu items on its menu board in advance of federally mandated regulations. We are very proud of our food at McDonald's, and we want our customers to feel good about eating it too. I recently spent some time with our owner operators and the U.S. leadership team, and I'm confident that our focus on strengthening our value messaging and delivering more premium food and beverage offerings will enable us to appeal some more customers more often. Now, let's turn to Europe. Third quarter comparable sales were up 1.8% and operating income grew 3% in constant currencies. We've been able to grow our market share despite the fact that Europe's economic environment remains challenging and that the IEO category continues to contract as our steady measures impact consumer confidence and purchasing power. Across the board in Europe, value has become even more important as the economic crisis lingers.\n : In addition to an ongoing emphasis on breakfast, core menu, and everyday value, a recent rehit of the M food event, which future the premium M Burger and the Chicken Legend with Bacon produce strong sales. And in Russia, we\u2019re driving sales through beef and chicken sandwiches when locally relevant case profiles. We are growing breakfast with the introduction of McRibs and by extending our operating hours. France\u2019s third quarter comparable sales were positive despite continued pressures, including slowing European tourism and a declining IEO market. And even though guest counts are soft, our initiatives are resonating and we continue to gain share. We strengthen our emphasis on value by featuring Petit Plaisir nationwide. These are smaller sandwiches at the \u20ac2 price point, and we also increased advertising levels. In addition, 600 restaurants now offer Petit free, which like the Eurosaver Menu offers great tasting products at the one to two year old price range. To promote value across the menu, French recently launched the Royale Barbecue, a quarter pound of cheese and a barbecue sauce to sales for \u20ac3.90 and delivers higher profit margins. And while Germany hasn\u2019t been impacted a significantly as the rest of Southern Europe economically, German consumers are some of the most sensitive to global economic news. Their high saving rates, controlled spending habits and focus on price deals all reflect continued weak consumer confidence. In response to the environment and softening sales, we\u2019ve been focused on driving business with great offers that round out their everyday value platform, which we call the SMS menu. In June, we introduced the McDeal extra value meal for \u20ac3.79 to augment our premium product extra value meals. Since then, we\u2019ve experienced all time high sales of all extra value meals. The team is currently evaluating additional ways to expand the McDeal brand and to build on this momentum with more options for our customers. In addition to combining Europe\u2019s successful premium entries with the greater emphasis on entry price value platforms, we continue to increase the number of restaurants opened for extended hours. And we continue to modernize the brand with an ongoing focus on reimaging. Together, these actions give us confidence; the McDonald's Europe is well positioned to succeed in a long-term. Now, let's shift over to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA. Comp sales were up 1.4% for the quarter, guest count comps grew at an even higher rate, and operating income increased 4% in constant currencies. Like the rest of the world, the environment in this region remains challenging. Consumer confidence is still fragile in Australia. Japan's recovery continues to be uneven, and China\u2019s more recent economic slowdown, are all impacting performance. However, our focus on broadening accessibility through value and convenience initiatives has enabled most of our major markets to continue growing their share of the IEO market. Japan has improved traffic considerably. Thanks to our branded affordability programs, particularly the 100 yen menu that was reintroduced earlier this summer. The market is now focused on converting this strong traffic growth into top line sales by strategically using e-coupons to promote add-on purchases, and drive average check. In Australia, sales gains have been driven by the loose change menu, which recently evolved to include several higher margin item such as the double beef and bacon burger, and the chicken and mayo sandwich. This value platform has helped grow traffic and provides an opportunity to offer customers new premium product news like the two limited time lamb offerings we featured beginning in August. The Serious Lamb Burger and Serious Lamb Taster Wrap cater to Australian strong affinity for lamb with a premium high-quality product and we\u2019ve seen a strong customer response. China continues to be a market with significant potential. Third quarter comparable sales increased 3.6% on top of a 11.3% last year. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in which we are more heavily concentrated continue to experience more economic softness, which is reflected in our results. At the same time, however, we\u2019re delivering double-digit comparable sales growth at breakfast. With established value platforms to drive traffic at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, China remains focused on building average check. We also drove results with new menu news, including bubble tea and the black and white sandwiches. This unique bundle takes the concept of Yin and Yang and brings it to life with two delicious products in one bucks; a beef patty on a black bun with white sesame seeds, and a chicken patty on a white bun with black sesame seeds, both top with grilled onions and a black pepper sauce. We also remain very committed to developing new restaurants in this high potential market. In fact, we are on track to open the 225 to 250 restaurants that were planned for this year, and to meet our goal of having 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013. Around the world, we have a solid foundation on which we are building. Our business, our brand, and our finances remain strong. And as our business continues to generate significant levels of cash, we will continue to reinvest in growth opportunities within the McDonald's brand. After that, all free cash flow will continue to be returned to shareholders over time. In fact, in the third quarter, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.77 per share. Combined with share purchases, we expect our total cash return to shareholders for 2012 to reach at least $5.5 billion. So in closing, we understand the environment that we\u2019re facing. We are drawing on our deep experience and customer insights to continue to grow share at our key markets for the future while making the necessary tactical adjustments to manage through the current environment. We are succeeding. As I mentioned before, most of our markets continue to gain share. I remain confident that we\u2019re driving value for our system and our shareholders over the long term. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pete.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello everyone. McDonald's continue to grow both constant currency revenues and earnings per share by 4% in the third quarter as we faced softening demand, tightening competition and rising cost in many of our markets. The environment will likely remain challenging for at least the next few quarters as we lapped some very strong quarterly comps. We remain focused on those factors within our control driving increased customer visits by delivering exceptional value, service and new products through an increasingly modern and relevant restaurant experience. Despite the environment, we continue to operate from a position to strength. Our global system is aligned, our financial discipline is intact, our brand is becoming increasingly more modern and differentiated, and we generated another $2 billion of operating income this quarter. We enjoy significant long term competitive advantages in our size and scale, and we are committed to managing the business for the long term by strategically investing to drive future growth and returns. Through September, revenues increased 6% in constant currency while our combined operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 31.1% as higher revenues were unable to offset increased expenses. Our overall profitability continues to be driven by franchise margins, which exceeded $1.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 4% in constant currencies. Each area of the world contributed to this growth. The franchised margin percent for the quarter declined 30 basis points as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher depreciation, primarily due to reimaging and rent. Consolidated company operated margin dollars were relatively flat in constant currencies and totaled $924 million for the quarter. The company operated margin percent remains healthy at 19.1% despite decreasing 90 basis points as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher operating cost across nearly all of our markets. Margins are a top line gain and they are under pressure in this current environment. We are continuing to invest in driving traffic by promoting and emphasizing value across most of our markets. Although initially this negatively impacts both revenue and margins as we have seen with many value initiatives including the U.S. Breakfast Dollar Menu and the U.K. Saver Menu, strong entry level value offerings bring incremental customers into our restaurants. After a period of time these traffic gains become more balanced with sales gains as customers migrate to other compelling offerings across the menu. Unparalleled value is foundational to our brand and to the success we have earned over the past 50 plus years. During challenging and uncertain economic times, it is vital that we provide this value to our customers in uniquely McDonald's ways to maintain and grow market share over the long term. In the U.S., company-operated margins declined 130 basis points to 19.8% for the third quarter, primarily due to higher labor cost in part due to the 2011 HIRE Act payroll tax credit, and a 2% increase in commodities. The softening top line coupled with higher cost across the P&L contributed to the decline in margins. In the near-term, we expect top and bottom line pressures to continue to negatively impact margins. Our guidance for the 2012 U.S. commodity cost increase remains at 3.5% to 4.5% with the projected fourth quarter increase slightly higher than the third. As we look to 2013, we expect U.S. commodity cost increases to be less than this year's increase. We can offset some of our higher input cost to pricing; we are closely monitoring the food away from home inflation index, which is up 2.8% through August. Our price increased in the U.S. through September is similar at 2.7%. For the year, the food away from home index is projected to be up 2% to 3%. If the index approach is the bottom of that range, we will likely not replace some or all of the increases that roll off in the fourth quarter as we strive to keep our increases in line with this critical index. Shifting to Europe, third quarter company operated margins declined 50 basis points to 20.4% primarily due to higher labor and commodity cost partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europe's company operated margins benefited from solid performance in the UK and Russia, which together represent over one-third of our company operated restaurants in Europe. In terms of pricing, Europe is averaging about 2.5% excluding Russia, which has higher price increases due to higher inflation. As we have said previously, the extreme economic uncertainty and ongoing austerity measures have reduced our pricing power in Europe. Year-to-date traffic is slightly negative in Europe. So we will evaluate future price increases cautiously amidst the fragile consumer environment. Europe\u2019s expected commodity cost increase for the year remains at 2.5% to 3.5%. Third quarter increased 3% and fourth quarter is projected to be up a little less than that. Preliminary estimates for next year indicate an increase slightly higher than this year's. Turning to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 150 basis points to 16.9% as higher labor and occupancy costs were partially offset by comparable sales increases. The acceleration of new restaurant openings in China continues to negatively impact the segments margin percentage. As expected, third quarter G&A in Europe and corporate was impacted by the incremental spending related to the London Olympic and Paralympic games. Fourth quarter comparison eased considerably with G&A expected to be down slightly for the quarter. For the full year, G&A guidance remains unchanged with cost projected to be up 6% in constant currencies. Financial discipline is a cornerstone of our plan to win, especially as it relates to G&A and capital expenditures. We diligently monitor the balance between our income and spending levels and make adjustments where warranted, while keeping in mind, our long-term growth objectives. We will not sacrifice long-term value creating growth opportunities in favor of short-term quick fixes. Despite the current challenges, we remain focused on delivering enduring growth that creates value for our shareholders and the entire McDonald's System. Consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, in 2012, we are investing about $2.9 billion into the business through a balanced strategic approach to new restaurant openings and enhancement of existing restaurants. Through September, we have opened 812 restaurants and are on pace to finish the year with over 1,300 new restaurants. We continue to generate strong returns on new restaurants in established markets with emerging markets like China achieving our benchmarks within a few years. Reimaging is a key differentiator for our brand, because we are modernizing both our interiors and exteriors. In addition, reimaging investments can enhance the capacity, efficiency, and overall operations of our restaurant. Reimaging also allows us to stretch our menu, particularly at the premium end as we have demonstrated in markets such as Australia and France, both of which are largely reimaged. Just as important, a newly remodeled restaurant energizes our crew who are the face of our brand to the 69 million customers we serve each and everyday. Similar to years passed, our reimaging projects tend to occur later in the calendar year as we try to avoid construction during the busier summer months. Through the first nine months, we have completed 1,463 reimages globally and remain on pace to hit our target of over 2,400 for the year. Reimaging continues to represent a significant opportunity for us to modernize our brand over the coming years. Globally, a little more than the third of our exteriors and about half of our interiors reflect a current contemporary look. Europe is farthest along and we'll finish the year with about 90% of interiors completed. The U.S. has completed roughly 30% of this interiors and exteriors, and is on track to complete 800 this year. Together with our owner operators, we have the financial capacity and access to capital to invest today to secure our collective future. Lastly, I\u2019d like to touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted third quarter results by $0.08. At current exchange rates, we expect full-year EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.17 to $0.19 which implies a negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02 on fourth quarter EPS. As usual, please take this as directional guidance only given the volatility in the currency markets. As a system, we remain focused on executing against our proven plan to win and the three global growth priorities of optimizing the menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility. The next few quarters will continue to be challenging from both the top and bottom line perspective. We have the right strategy in place and are making the appropriate tactical adjustments to address the near-term. As a system, we are aligned and we\u2019ll continue to make the right long-term decisions through a balanced approach to building new units and growing sales at existing locations to expand our market leading position in the $900 billion plus global informal eating out market. We remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate the volatile environment and create enduring value for our system and shareholders. Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin the Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Pete. (Operator Instructions) So we\u2019ll begin the Q&A with Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs: You guys talked a lot about the reason for the same-store sales deceleration being primarily macro driven, soft industry sales and economic slowdowns, and lower consumer confidence, but this quarter, your global same-store sales were lower than in any quarter even during the peak of the financial crisis, at time when the macro indicators like consumer confidence were much worse. Why do you think that is? Why is McDonald not weathering the macro turbulence as well as before? And then on a related note, how can you be certain that emphasizing value is the right strategic response and [more] just compound the challenges you're faced by eroding margins too?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Michael a couple of things on your comments. One, relative to how we fed in the past actually the strategies and some of the results we're seeing are similar, I will tell you one of the differences is it's been very red we've ever seen all of our major markets experiencing the impact of these kind of global economies at the same time. And so, that is one of the things that we're seeing right now and therefore we are as we have been investing to ensure that we continue to drive traffic and market share, because we know that correlates to our longer term growth. Relative to whether or not we know that these are the right strategies. I mentioned earlier on the call, our market share is flat or up in all of our major markets, that is a definite sign of strength, and we are gaining market share and some of our markets where we've really placed some of these additional efforts. So, we feel really good about that. Clearly, we'd love to be able to see more sales, and that will come in time, but right now it's about having more traffic and appealing to more customers.\nKathy Martin: Great. Our next question is Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.\nMitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research: Great. Thanks very much and thanks for sharing the trend in October. And I was just wondering, I know you usually don\u2019t do this, but you did say negative, you haven't said that in a current quarter as far as I could tell. Can you maybe just give us a sense of the magnitude of the negative comps that are running in October and does that big trading day shift play into that negative at this point during the month or more at the end of the month? Thank you.\nDon Thompson: Hey, Mitch, thanks, a couple of things. one is, as you know, we have been transparent and continue to want to be. So we wanted to give you guys some insight into where we saw October trending and that's only what that is. That's about October and the trend we see in October. We won't give additional information about the quarter. I will tell you that the trading day does factor into that negative trend.\nKathy Martin: Next question is Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndy Barish \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Yeah, just wondering on the inflation outlook for 2013, the U.S. being lower inflation than 2012. Is there something going on with contracting or supply chain just kind of shifting around when you look at obviously the raw material prices in the markets they appear higher, can you give us a little more color there?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Andy. It absolutely has a lot to do with the contracting that's going on. The suppliers were able to get a fair amount of contract in place before the drought started impacting some of these costs significantly, and so we feel pretty good. Obviously, in January, we'll quantify that for you and give you a little more texture, but it really has to do with the great work the supply chain and our suppliers have done working together with our risk management folks to get some pretty good positions on.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is David Tarantino from Baird.\nDavid Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Question on the tactical changes you\u2019re making to emphasize value. Don, could you give us some examples of how that has worked in the past and may be the magnitude of the lift that you see when you pursue the value strategies. And then also, if you could give us some idea of you talked about a lag between the implementation and the impact, if you could give us some sense of layout the plans for the next six to 12 months. When do you think you\u2019ll start to see the biggest level of impact on a global basis?\nDon Thompson: Hi, David. Absolutely, we can touch based on those points. First of all, some of the things we've seen, earlier in the year, we talked to you guys about some of the things we wanted to see in Australia, and actually we talked about it for the very beginning of the year relative to their value and the fact that we thought we needed to have stronger value as we saw the economy soften. They put in place the Loose Change menu, we saw a very solid turnaround in terms of our guest counts, our guest counts now are quite strong. They continue to evolve the Loose Change menu to look for opportunities for profitability, but we know again that when consumer confidence is soft what we have to do is to appeal to more customers to come into the restaurants. Australia has been trending in a very positive direction. They are clearly comping on some tougher numbers from last year at our 40th anniversary celebration, but their numbers have been solid. France, we\u2019ve talked about France earlier. In France, we say we needed to have stronger value, so now we know Petit Plaisir is strong. I did mention that there is a \u20ac2 Quarter Pounder with cheese that they\u2019ve implemented in the market. They've implemented a \u20ac3.90 McRoyal, which is a Quarter Pound cheese, but it has barbecue sauce on it to get a little bit more margin. Petit Pre, which is in the one to two year old price point range. So, France had to do the same thing and as you all know, France is one of those markets where austerity is quite strong and the reduction in tourism has also impacted that marketplace. Lastly, I mentioned Japan. Japan had, we have been growing guest counts tremendously in Japan. Now, it is still a very tough economy, but what we\u2019ve seen is that, we are in a position now that we would like to be able to convert some of those guest counts into more sales and more profitability, but our guest count growth in Japan has been very strong. And so, we know that the value play combined with some premium margin products to give us some profitability lift is a good thing. Relative to lag time and the impact of these adjustments that we make in the markets, what typically happens is, and it depends on the market. We have to make the changes in the market and get these things out, consumer awareness begins to take root and then we will see in a period of say, 60 to 90 days, we typically see the front-end of some of these adjustments. When you\u2019ve got a system like the U.S. System and they are now reinforcing and going back to some of their Dollar Menu, specifically Dollar Menu merchandising and advertising, that's one of the things that has to take place by making sure that the operators are all aligned, which they are now and if we get a chance to go out and do the appropriate things to our creative media. So you begun to see some of these things already, but in the U.S., it's still going to take some time relative to them really establishing and reestablishing the strength of some of those value offerings. The bigger piece in the U.S. is what we talked about with the implementation of new sandwiches and new food. So this Cheddar Bacon Onion, we are pretty excited about, that product is now in the marketplace. It will be followed by McRib. We\u2019ve seen that, McRib is the favorite and then as we go into next year, I have already seen now some of the products that will be implemented next year, and so I feel pretty good about where they are going in the first part of the year. Having said that, Pete mentioned, the first quarter of next year keep in mind, we are up against a 7.5% I think it is comp, and so it's going to be a tougher quarter. We had some benefits from the leap year benefit and also some weather benefit. So, we know that that's still going to be a tough quarter, but some of these things already taking route. \nKathy Martin: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much, a sort of a two part question. In Europe it does seem like you're getting some traction on value at least the last two months seem to be showing some directional improvement despite a very poor macro relative to U.S. So can you confirm you're actually seeing in your restaurants that kind of improvement? And then further around U.S. maybe we're just not as \u2013 or still earlier into this sort of value promotion we're not seeing it in the U.S. yet, and maybe it's just a matter of time, but if you could comment on that, specifically in the U.S. you said you're flat to gaining share in every market, do you still think that in the U.S. this quarter or do you think maybe you have back slipped a little bit in market share? Thanks. \nDon Thompson: John, for the U.S. specifically, we still know that for the full year we\u2019re still gaining market share. One of things clearly that we\u2019ve been looking at is sales comps and making sure that as we look at comparables if you were through the rest of the competitive set that we\u2019re also still in that mode of gaining market share or at least maintaining market share. We have had as you know, this quarter was a tough quarter for the U.S. and so what I\u2019m feeling good about is again the implementation of the value, platform and Dollar Menu being more aggressively spoken to in our advertising and the menu calendar with CBO and with McRib. So at this point, still gaining share for the year in the U.S., but also looking forward to the fourth quarter really stimulating some of our momentum again.\nPeter J. Bensen: And in Europe John, we are seeing the benefits of some of that value emphasis. I think Don mentioned in his remarks, the McDeals in Germany, which isn't entry level value, but as a value meal per se has really stimulated the sale, not only of that product group but of all Extra Value Meals. And we are seeing it as well in France with some of the items he mentioned and their trends through the quarter as well. So the tactics are gaining some traction.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you very much. Just a clarification on a question. Clarification just being on, I know there was a question earlier about October and you said trending negative. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color to say that, kind of expatriating the shift, is there any reason to believe we're seeing a change in trend line in any of the three big regions, because otherwise it would seem somewhat understandable to be a modest negative comp. But I'm just wondering if you could give any color as to whether you've seen something more recently in any of the three regions to suggest the change in trend line. And then separately, more broadly, Pete, you talked in Europe and you just talked about this earlier about pushing the value in the near-term, it hurts your check-in margin, but helps traffic. I'm just wondering whether you might think of Europe somewhat differently than the U.S. or perhaps Australia, where they would be because it's not one contiguous region and so many different markets and consumers that you should see a different response from Europe with this big value push, versus perhaps essentially sort of elsewhere? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Okay, Jeff. Regarding October, it's not our practice to get into a lot of detail while we're still in mid-month. So when we do the release of the October sales in early November, we'll give you the appropriate texture around the geographic segments and impact of the trading day, et cetera.\nPeter J. Bensen: Regarding Europe, it is a little bit disguised when we look at Europe in total and the fact that Russia and the UK are doing very well. They are both growing traffic, both of those IEO markets are expanding. So some of the phenomena we are seeing in the rest of the continent and mostly in Southern Europe where the IEO is contracting is not being experienced in those two big markets. And in fact, the UK has had kind of that traditional approach of value across the menu board, so the Saver Menu with the 99 pence entry level value. The little tasters with that kind of next year and then just great value across the rest of their menu with core and premium products has continued to do well. So again, that strategy that Don talked about bringing in traffic with entry level value and then ultimately those customers trading across the menu overtime is really working well in the UK. And as the eating out markets either stabilized or start to grow again in those other markets in Europe, we know that by continuing to maintain and grow the traffic that ultimately will allow them to expand their purchases at McDonald's as well.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Greg Badishkanian form Citigroup.\nGregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup: Great. Thanks. Just a quick one on China major QSR operator recently guided to moderating same-store sales in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering with respect to your comment about taking share, are you taking share from the global chains or is this more domestic and we\u2019ve got a comment about the last quarter, in the last few months or was that just kind of year-to-date when you talked about taking share in China?\nDon Thompson: Greg, what we look at is, we look at the overall IEO, so the informal eating out category and we look to see whether or not we are growing share in that informal eating-out category. And that's what my comments were about when I mentioned we are maintaining or gaining share in our major markets around the world. Relative to China specifically, when we talk about share, we focus our measurements on the top five cities. And those are the cities that we have really focused our growth efforts on initially. In those cities, we are gaining share and we continue to gain share. And so we feel very good about that. We are less focused now on the cities around those five or outside of that five top tier cities. We are continuing to grow into those cities, but right now our concentration is in the top five.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.\nHoward Penney \u2013 Hedgeye Risk Management: Hi, thanks very much. I'm having some trouble sort of connecting the dots if you will for what is causing the deceleration in McDonald's sales trends. And I understand the macro environment and the question those asked on the outset about the difference in time, but last time versus this time but and when I think about what you are doing to address the problem, when you use the word tactical, it sort of implies temporary, meaning value is not something that you can live off or an aggressive value strategy is not something that you or your franchisees could live off for sort of any extended period of time. And I think about the changes that you\u2019ve made to the menu and the way the menu has grown, including beverages over the last sort of five, six, seven years or eight years since Plan to Win has started. And if I go back to the last time McDonald's had a comp problem, you did a time-and-motion study saying that, the way the employees moved in the back of the house was causing a comp problem and it allows you to make creating inefficiencies and if I think of all the equipments that you\u2019ve put in the back of the house it could be creating again inefficiencies. So I am just wondering that the strategies that you are taking on now to really correct what you're seeing in the back of the house. Again, I'm not, I guess this is more of a U.S. centric kind of question. But it just seems like there is something else going on that I can't really put my finger on and I don't know if you know the answer to the question either. But it just seems like there is something else here that went missing to understand the decline in the or the deceleration in sales in what appears to be a continued deceleration through this year and early next year? I don't know if that question made sense or not, but\u2026\nDon Thompson: Hey, Howard, I'll give it a short and you'll tell us whether or not we speak to the concerns that you had. First of all when we talk about value, we're not talking about as we view it aggressive value, we're talking about having a value component that is a good solid mix. So typically our value components are somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% of sales. So we are not talking about being super aggressive and many of the markets that we've talked about this, we had already made some type of an adjustment whether that would be, we weren't speaking about value as much, some markets didn't have value platform in place. And then there is other market, so if you looked at U.S. a couple of things were done tactically that we are readdressing now. So as an example, earlier in the year we began to talk about Extra Value Menu in the U.S. business and we stopped talking about the Dollar Menu. That was as a result of trying to get a little bit more profitability in margin out of the existing value offerings that we had. What we found is that, that did not resonated strongly, so we are going back to talking about the Dollar Menu. So that's what we mean by a tactical adjustment. These are not strategic changes in a large sense. We're going to maintain value. We\u2019re maintaining our focus on premium based products. We\u2019re maintaining the growth category focus we have around chicken, and beef and breakfast. We\u2019re maintaining operational execution around extended hours and operating hours. We have continued to improve operations in the restaurant. We continue to see what we call our CSO scores, Customer Satisfaction Opportunity scores go in the right direction, we\u2019re improving there. We have continued to support service enhancements and improvements where there's dual-lane drive-through, handheld order takers, continuing to reimage the restaurants. So all of the operational things we\u2019re continuing to move those. In addition to just getting back on course with premium based products, a little less advertising we\u2019ve had this year on some of our blended ice beverages, we did do the frappe, chocolate chip frappe. We\u2019ve had a little less on smoothies. So we\u2019ll get back to get to the right mix relative to some of those kinds of things. So that\u2019s really what we mean, when we say tactical adjustments. They are not strategic changes. They\u2019re tactical adjustments are things we may have moved a little bit away from, and we did that for reasons. They were based upon some of the margin and commodity cost considerations, but now we are getting back to a point, where we can make these adjustments. Our cash flow for operators in the U.S. this year is up $9,000 year-to-date. It is up $12,000 trailing 12 months. So we are healthy relative to the owner operator organizations and we had a point where we can make some of these shifts.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Matt Difrisco from Lazard.\nMatthew Difrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets: Thank you. I just had a question with respect to sort of follow up on that with the remodel campaign as well. I wonder if you could give us any sort of color as far as the same-store sales. In recent quarters it looks like you are losing a little share there in the U.S. And I\u2019m wondering if you are seeing the sustained lift that you were reporting earlier on a global basis from those remodels, therefore I guess it\u2019s still producing some good lifts rather than the overall comp base or is the overall comp base slowing it down a little bit. And then, I just want to know how should we think about our neighbors to the north there in Canada, I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing similar trends in Canada that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. or is that a little bit stronger I guess as their economy is? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Matt, specifically about the remodels, we're continuing to see the same performance out of the remodels that we've been experiencing over the last couple of years. So that kind of 6% to 7% average lift is what we\u2019re experiencing. We were just with the U.S. leadership team and the leadership operators a week ago, and we took a part of the discussion was around that specifically and the remodels continue to perform as we've been seeing and as we've expected. And specifically if you talk about Canadian remodels, they are also doing extremely well in that same range as they have embarked on what they call \u201cDestination 2012\u201d, but basically going about reimaging their entire system here over the next couple of years.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Coming back to the U.S. a little bit and you talked about some of the tactical changes, could you also talk down if you guys are planning to step up the cadence frequency promotion around new products and sort of much more of a new product pipeline for the first half of next year versus what we saw this past year, and heavier marketing weight behind that is that sort of in the plans?\nDon Thompson: Jason, thanks for the question. Yes, we will have a stronger new menu presence for 2013 then we have had in 2012.\nKathy Martin: And our next question is from Larry Miller from RBC.\nLarry Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. Thanks. Pete, I was wondering if you might be able to parse our how much of the margin erosion in the major markets was due to the increase in value and how much was due to the deleverage on same-store sales? And then, in conjunction with that, can you give us a sense on, you talked about how the increase in the value program, you typically see traffic rise in a certain period of time, how long after that does the margins tend to normalize? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Larry, we don\u2019t have the, I can't pinpoint for you specifically the components of the margin decline between the value pieces, et cetera, because especially what you have going on in some of these environments is, flat to declining transaction counts in the declining broader eating-out markets, at the same time, commodity costs are increasing significantly, and we are promoting more value. So it\u2019s really the combination of all of those that are pressuring the margins. And as Don was talking about it in one of his answers, there is not exactly a specific timeframe with each and every market as to when you see that change. Australia actually saw it probably quicker than a lot of other markets over this past summer when the Loose Change menu was introduced in the March timeframe and by the summer months, they were already hitting hard with some premium product. They hit a premium Olympics sandwich promotion, and then went right into the Serious Lamb promotion, which were great at trading customers up and building average check. So it does depend on the market and the general, both marketing plan and what\u2019s happening in the overall environment. But as Don mentioned, we're confident as we do this, that we know we will ultimately as the market start to improve, hold on to those customers and trade them up.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi, thanks. Just thinking about the U.S., maybe other major markets as well that have perceived a recent point of sale upgrades. I mean just wondering if there is anything that you can do in that regard in terms of customer loyalty for example or just trying to reach your active customers more specifically and maybe to offering them value on a very targeted basis, through some functionality that either does, or could it just on that new platform?\nDon Thompson: Hey, John, thanks for the question. First, a couple of things, and I know, I'm surprised no one has asked it today yet. But we usually get asked the question about this New Paltz help you out at all in terms of order in time and things of that nature. We have found that we have seen a small benefit in this early on relative to that. So the ordering time has decreased slightly, which helped us with capacity and that's one of the thing that we wanted to be able to make the job easier for those taking the orders in the restaurant. So we know that that happens. Relative to other promotional benefits or consumer related benefits with our new technology systems, we are looking at and testing in certain countries around the world, everything from e-couponing to mobile order and pay to a bit of I will cal it a customer recovery, customer retention type relationship that we build with those who have smartphone. So this is one of the thing that we are looking at. We are not at all prepared to go broad with that as of yet, but we are looking at those kinds of things John.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse: Thank you, and my question is for Pete. Pete, as we think about this franchise margins and kind of this interplay between comps and I know you increased D&A from your reimaging program, I mean, we could see it in the U.S. and Europe, as the years progressed and comps have slowed, we've gone from gains year-over-year to now slight declines. How do we think about modeling that interplay, maybe for each of those regions, where's the turning point, like what comp do you need to offset the increased D&A? In other words, where do we maintain franchise margins in that setting, where do we grow or where do we decline?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Keith, there's not an exact number that we can share with you. You broadly touched on it. At a 1.9 global comp for the quarter with the increase in the investments we're making in these markets that obviously is not enough to overcome the additional depreciation, so it's somewhere north of that. It also does matter on the pace of that reimaging. So how quickly is that depreciation expense building as we start to get near the end of a lot of these investments in Europe, those reimaging expenditures will start to trail off and so the incremental depreciation won't be as large and at the same time, the U.S. is around a similar amount this year that they did last year and should probably be something similar next year. So that incremental piece will be somewhat stable, meaning, we'll continue to need that higher comp to increase the margins there.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nAndrew Charles \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, it\u2019s Andrew Charles on for Joe today. Don along the lines of technology upgrades, can you give us an update on kiosks and where you stand with those? And then Pete, I know you remain cautious on pricing, but I was wondering what the early forecast for the food away from home index looks like in 2013 for context? Thanks.1\nDon Thompson: Hi, Andrew, relative to kiosk, as you guys know, we are looking at some, we have some restaurants in Europe, and we have one of the markets that we have quite a few kiosks in. We're looking at how that will apply globally and whether or not this kind of gets to a point that was made earlier or a question that was asked earlier by John, whether or not, where we go with the technology platform. So kiosks are one option, but the other option is how much we use mobile phone technologies or smartphone technologies, because those are also mobile apps and you can do mobile ordering. So we\u2019re looking at both of these things, and we do have a couple of markets though that are almost fully implemented with kiosk.\nPeter J. Bensen: And then regarding next year\u2019s forecast for food away from home, it actually looks like it might be a little bit higher than this year. So this is preliminary, but food away from home is looking to be 2.5% to 3.5% next year. And then the other index we look at there is food at home and while this year food at home is growing more slowly than food away from home, that will flip next year potentially with the early forecast being 3% to 4% for food at home. So again, these are early numbers, but that\u2019s kind of an indication of where things are going and I think probably right now more indicative of the broader commodity market than anything else.\nKathy Martin: Right. Our next question is from R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar\nR.J. Hottovy \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to focus a little bit back on China, and Don, I appreciate the color you had on the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and the progress you\u2019re making there. But assuming Tier 3 cities and below are going to be part of the program to get to that 2000 number by the end of fiscal 2013, could you just give us an update on the average unit volumes you are seeing in some of those smaller markets and some of the nearest locations you have there?\nDon Thompson: Yeah, RJ. Clearly our average unit volumes are strong than our Tier 1 and 2. They do decrease a bit as you go out to Tier 3. The one of the things that we\u2019ve seen also is, as we begin to move out of the urban areas that's where our drive-through strategy really kicks in more so. So as we really begin to expand and as we build more drive-throughs, there we expect to see some stronger volumes as a result of drive-through base restaurants instead of restaurants that are in line. So you got a little bit of a balance there. In the urban areas where you are more retail, street retail, those volumes are very strong because of the population base. As you moved to look further out, if we build street retail, it might be lower, but if we're building drive-throughs with those then we see increased volumes. Clearly, you see increased costs, but you do see increased volumes and we're seeing strong sales results in those drive-through bills.\nKathy Martin: All right. We have time for one more question. It\u2019s Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara H. Senatore \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Thank you. I just made it. I had a question to go back to China. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the margins and get some context for the unit openings. Is this different in the sense of new units dragging on segment margins or country margins? Is that a different fundamentally from what happens when you see growth elsewhere, or is it just that you are growing faster in China than you are in other markets? And to that same point is the growth from like a segment level in anticipation of staffing up and that kind of thing for the new units or is it that they may with so much lower volumes that they tend to drag on margins?\nPeter J. Bensen: All right, Sara, great question. It is actually something that we see in all markets. So when the new stores open, they tend to open a little bit below, depending on the market, but tend to open below the average volume for that market, but then the next couple of years, their comp sales exceed the average for the market and they quickly get up to that market average. And so in China at 225 to 250 openings, it is that pace of growth in that market that's causing the new stores to impact the overall margin more significantly than you\u2019re seeing in other markets. If you look at our margins before the new stores in China, they\u2019re actually up for the quarter and year-to-date period, and the impact of those new stores is lessening compared to what we were seeing, let's say this time last year. So it is all directionally as expected. And the new unit it is appropriate reason to why they are a little bit lower in terms of margins. Some are as I mentioned the opening volumes they come out with. Some are some of the additional preopening cost associated with opening. Some as Don mentioned to drive-throughs, which are going into some more green areas they tend to have a little bit higher construction cost built for the volumes we know will be there in the future, but don't quite hit that volume in the first couple of years. So it's a variety of those factors.\nKathy Martin: Okay. We are out of time for questions. So I'll now turn it over to Don now who has a few closing comments.\nDon Thompson: So I really want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. As we said and we believe, the McDonald's System of franchisee, suppliers and company employees is well aligned as we continue to execute our Plan to Win and our three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility around the world. We remain steadfast in our commitment to our long-term strategies as we make smart and strategic decisions to mitigate short-term pressures in these challenging times. And in closing, I'm confident that what our solid strategic plans continuing to grow our global market share. We will deliver and building profitable growth for the system and for our shareholders. So again thanks for joining us today and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-07-23 13:23:00", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations Don Thompson \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer Peter J.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instruction) I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson, and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast. And before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as our reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with a corresponding GAAP measures. And now I'd like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to join you today in my new role as CEO, and I'm honored to lead this great system of first classed owner operators, supplier partners and company employees. And I\u2019m confident that together, we will continue to build this business for all of our stakeholders under the umbrella of our global plan to win. As I said on our last call, we will stay the course; the recent change in management does not mean a change in strategy. With that, let me provide a perspective on the quarter results and an overview of our plans as we continue to navigate this environment in the short-term and drive the business for the long-term benefit of our system and our shareholders. McDonald\u2019s continued its solid performance in the second quarter. We\u2019ve continued to grow market share despite a slowing global economy. For the quarter, global comparable sales were up 3.7%, operating income increased 3% in constant currencies, and earnings per share reached $1.32, a 3% increase in constant currencies. And in July, global comparable sales are expected to be positive, but less than second quarter. We\u2019re experiencing stronger headwinds on both the top and bottom lines. Some of the headwinds are macroeconomic such as declining consumer settlement and higher commodity and labor cost. Other pressures are the result of planned strategic decisions we\u2019ve made to grow the business. these include actions we've taken to enhance our value platforms, our worldwide owner, operator convention; it brings the system together every two years and investments in technology initiatives. Despite these demands, the system remains aligned around the plan to win in our three global priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019re focused on driving results in this environment by continuing to refine our efforts around these priorities to address local market conditions. So let's start with the U.S. where comparable sales increased 3.6% for the quarter and operating income rose 2%. The U.S. continues to build sales and guest counts. It is however happening at a slower pace amid an unpredictable economic environment and increased competition. Sales gains during the quarter were driven by everyday value across a variety of price points and new menu news. Breakfast continued the strong momentum with local market emphasis on core breakfast sandwiches and the introduction of Blueberry Banana Nut Oatmeal in May. Beverages were also a key contributor to growth. The new Cherry Berry Chiller helped to drive beverage sales on top of last year\u2019s strong results, from the launch of Frozen Strawberry Lemonade. Relative to our core products, our 20 piece Chicken McNuggets were highlighted on the new extra value menu, which provides value across multiple price tiers. As a result, total sales of Chicken McNuggets increased nearly 11% during the promotional period when compared to the same time last year. Now our focus remains on driving guest counts and we are resigning our plans as the environments shift. These plans are balanced across product categories and price tiers. For example, we\u2019re enhancing everyday value with new news and promoting core and premium products for exciting games like the Olympics sign which is starting today. And to ensure customers have more reasons to visit us in a near-term, we will continue to leverage promotional food events like Spicy Chicken McBites and also additional McCafe flavors. Our new product pipeline also includes several new beef and chicken products and additional innovations around breakfast and beverages was currently testing a number of new products, some of which have been adapted directly from other areas of the world. Turning to Europe, second-quarter comparable sales were up 3.8% and operating income grew 8% in constant currencies. The UK and Russia delivered strong sales for the quarter, and while France and Germany are also positive. These two markets are feeling a pressure of the ongoing Eurozone difficulties. Europe\u2019s IEO industry is contracted as austerity measures continue to impact consumer purchasing power and confidence. Despite this, however, the UK, France, and Spain have gained market share. And in Germany and Italy, we are maintaining our share. So although year-to-date guest counts are down in several markets, we are faring better than the competition. Europe is re-energizing its 2012 plans. Those plans are being re-energized to drive traffic in this environment. Markets are also placing an even stronger focus on value offerings across the menu and on promotional food events featuring premium products. The UK\u2019s success is mainly been driven by a balance of popular menu offerings in the second quarter. The great taste of America food event as an example boosted average check, a focus on daypart expansion also contributed to results, especially at breakfast, with a new wrapped (inaudible) pork sausage, bacon eggs, potatoes and cheese wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. Russia also continues to perform quite well with a strong focus on breakfast, lunch and beverages. Second quarter marks the seven consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth in Russia. In France, we\u2019re increasing our media spend to further strengthen our share of voice and increasing the focus on our popular Petit Plaisir line up of smaller premium sandwiches that are priced at a mid-tier value. Germany consumers remain deal conscious in an increasingly competitive environment. We stepped up our value messaging to consistently remain customers of the great everyday value that they can get at McDonald\u2019s. The market recently implemented mid-deal of value meal that offers a chicken classic or McChicken classic or a hamburger, Royale with Cheese along with a fry and a drink for \u20ac3.79. This contributed to strong sales and guest counts in the month of June. Germany is also leveraging its nearly 800 McCafes with new [news] including bubble tea. This is helping strengthen multiple dayparts including breakfast and afternoon snack. From value and variety on our menu including the McRib, which is now available in 24 markets, to our ability to offer more convenience options like cashless payment in 85% of our restaurants. We are providing European customers with what they want. And our commitment and ability to execute a great relevant experience for the customer is evident in our improving customer satisfaction scores as well. Now shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMIA, comp sales were up 0.9% for the quarter and operating income increased 1% in constant currencies. Across this region, we are seeing fragile consumer confidence in Australia, Japan\u2019s uneven recovery, and an economic slow down in China. We are positioning our markets appropriately in this environment with strong value platforms to build traffic. And we will complement these platforms with average check builders that include new food news and brand extensions. Australia\u2019s second quarter comparable sales growth was due in part to strong breakfast results, as well as the successful launch of its Olympics promotion. Additionally, the Loose Change Menu introduced in late March has helped drive guest count and sales. And as expected, once customers realize that this value offering is not going away, the use of the menu has leveled out and they are beginning to trade up to other items like extra value meals. Japan continues to grapple with a difficult economy coupled with ongoing disaster recovery and anticipation of energy restrictions. This is taking a toll on consumers who are now eating more meals at home. Despite a significantly contracting IEO market, we continue to grow share this quarter. We responded to customers needs by rolling out a new multicare platform the 100 yen, 250 yen and 500 yen menu. We are feeling to even more customers with this new branded affordability platform. Unlike any market that implements value, our strategy is to drive sales and profitability by trading these visits up to extra value meals and other premium offers. Utilizing our philosophy to learn, share, and scale, Japan is growing its beverage business by promoting trail of ice coffee from the U.S. through sampling events. Turning to China, in China, consumers are reacting with greater caution as the economy has slowed. We\u2019ve seen this particularly in our tier 1 cities where we are more heavily concentrated. We're also seeing high competitive activity focused on value. In China, branded affordability has been a key part of our strategy over the last few years and we are staying to course. Value lunch and the recently launched value dinner are driving sales and guest counts that contributed to second quarter\u2019s comparable sales increase of 2.2% and market share gains in our top five cities. China spent this growing daypart continues to be breakfast. Our ability to bundle convenience with uniquely McDonald's products is resonating with customers, not only this is daypart now represent more than 9% of sales in China, it continues to grow. We're also making sure that the brand is accessible. We remain on track to open 225 to 250 restaurants this year and also continue to focus on conveniences like make delivery and dessert kiosks. As you can clearly see, we are operating at a more difficult global environment. And this environment requires us to be even more flexible and aggressive, particularly as economic and consumer volatility persists. And although we\u2019ve continued to deliver positive results, let me be very clear, we\u2019re not satisfied. We remain focused on appealing to customers more than anyone else as we run the business for the long-term. The headline is this, we have a resilient business model, a talented and aligned system, and experience in every type of operating environment. We\u2019re staying focused on the things that will continue to differentiate us like our new restaurant designs. We\u2019ve already reimaged 1,000 restaurants around the world this year and remain on target to meet our goal of more than 2,400 reimages in 2012. And, we are on course to build over 1,300 new restaurants this year in emerging markets like China, Brazil, India, and Russia, and also in more established markets including the U.S., France, Germany and Australia. We will continue to go after these new store development opportunities when and where appropriate. We have the discipline, the capital and resources to continue to do this successfully. Now as our business grows and continues to generate significant levels of cash, our philosophy for its use remains the same. We will reinvest in the business first, and after that we\u2019ll return all free cash flow to shareholders. In fact, in the second quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In closing, we understand what we are facing. From a macro economic environment to an increasingly competitive landscape, we\u2019ve been in situations like these before and we\u2019re drawing on net knowledge and experience to manage through these times. By remaining committed to our long-term strategies to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s while continuing to fortify our shot-term plans, I\u2019m confident we will continue to grow the business for the system and our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pete.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Our focus on the plan to win and the three global priorities of optimizing the menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility continue to fuel solid top line performance. I\u2019d like to start with a few higher level comments about the quarter and then get into more detail on the results. As you know, the macro economic environment for the past several years has been challenging and unpredictable. Our global diversification has been an advantage, as pressures felt in certain markets were often balanced with stronger performance in others. In second quarter 2012, this wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. While we face significant cost pressures as expected, we also experienced slower sales growth in most of our major markets. Persistent unfavorable economic conditions are weighing on consumer sentiment and spending. And in many markets, we are continuing to experience flat to declining IEO traffic along with a heightened competitive landscape. We are employing different tactics in each market to address this with the common theme being increasing the emphasis on value in the short-term to drive traffic, which is a critical element of long-term sustainable growth. These tactics are likely to take hold beginning later this year. Relative to cost pressures, company operated margins are negatively impacted by higher commodity and labor costs. In many markets, this was on top of mid-single digit commodity cost increases last year. Higher G&A expenses were also a headwind. As previously communicated, the $100 million of incremental G&A investments this year are negatively impacting operating income growth, especially in second and third quarters. We believe these investments in technology enhancements, Olympic sponsorship and our world-wide convention are foundational to future growth, and the long-term health of our business and brand. While we\u2019re not satisfied with these second quarter results, they are not entirely unexpected. We previously communicated that second quarter operating income growth would be affected by the volatile global economy and related headwinds along with our near-term investments. In keeping with our historical practice, we will not be updating or providing earnings guidance going forward. While earlier this year we disclosed that we expected to meet our long-term average annual constant currency financial targets, based on what we know today considering recent trends along with the heightened global economic challenges, it appears likely that we will end 2012 at or somewhat below the 6% to 7% constant currency operating income growth target. Now turning to results, in second quarter, system wide sales increased 6% in constant currencies. We continue to grow both global comparable sales and guest counts and are now serving 69 million customers per day, 3 million more than a year ago. This contribute to a 6% constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars and at $1.9 billion they represent approximately 70% of total restaurant margin dollars. The franchised margin percent was up 10 basis points to 83.2%. Global company operating margin dollars for the quarter totaled [$815 million] and we\u2019re up 1% in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 80 basis points to 18.2%, as a result of softer top line results coupled with increased cost pressures. To put that 18.2% into perspective, it is our third highest second-quarter margin since the year 2000. In the U.S., second quarter company operating margins declined 90 basis points to 19.8% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by 5% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher labor and occupancy costs. As a result of risk management efforts and supplier production efficiencies, the full-year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket has been lowered to 3.5% to 4.5%. This implies the second half increase of approximately 2%, which should be fairly balanced between third and fourth quarters. In terms of pricing, the U.S. is running about 3% for the trailing 12 months. The food-away-from-home inflation index is projected to be up 2% to 3% in 2012. If it ends the year closer to the bottom end of the range, we may have a little less room to take pricing in the back half of the year. As always though, we will be thoughtful with future price increases speaking to maintain positive guest counts. In Europe, second quarter company operated margins decreased 30 basis points to 19.3%, primarily impacted by higher labor expenses, 4% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher occupancy costs. Europe\u2019s projected full year commodity cost increase remains at 2.5% to 3.5%, which implies a second half increase of approximately 2% to 3%. As noted earlier this year, we have less pricing power in Europe than in the U.S. primarily due to the austerity measures. Our price increases vary by market with Russia at the high-end due to a significant inflation and all other markets averaging about 2% year-over-year. As [we\u2019ll have] prior year increases during the second half of this year, we will likely replace them with more increases. Turning to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 170 basis points to 15.3% as modestly positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher labor, commodity and occupancy cost. In addition, new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the segments margin percent. EMEA\u2019s guest count increases significantly out paid comparable sales increases for the quarter. So we are encouraged by the efforts of our franchisees and company employees that resulted in increased demand for brand McDonald\u2019s throughout the region. As Don mentioned, in Australia, where we introduced a more robust value platform in mid March, comparable sales are steadily improving as consumers migrate beyond the value platform to the rest of the menu. This overall trend is in line with what we\u2019ve seen in other markets, when new value platforms are introduced. Turning to G&A, second quarter cost increased 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to higher employee cost, our biennial worldwide convention in April and investments in technology enhancements. Our convention was a great success with 16,000 attendees walking away focused and aligned on our key strategies. It also provided a great opportunity to learn and share ideas from markets around the world, allowing us to better leverage our size and scale. Looking to third quarter, we expect a double-digit increase in G&A given our sponsorship of the upcoming Summer Olympics and Paralympic games in London. With regard to other operating income, gains on sales of restaurants included the sale of 13 restaurants in two provinces in China to developmental licensees, bringing our total number of franchised restaurants in China to 54. The second quarter effective tax rate was 33%, 120 basis points higher than a year ago. Last year\u2019s second quarter rate reflected a non-recurring tax benefit related to certain foreign operations. For the year, we continue to expect the effective rate to be between 31% and 33%. Our business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. Our first priority remains reinvesting this cash in our business to build future returns and enhance shareholder value. This year these investments are balanced between opening more than 1,300 new restaurants and reimaging over 2,400 existing locations. We remain committed to this effort and are making steady progress. Through June, we have opened 450 new restaurants globally. Regarding reimaging, over half of our 33,700 restaurants operate current contemporary interior, while more than a third of our exteriors reflect a new look. Reimaging our restaurants is powerful, because it is a multiyear, multilayered initiative that can enhance restaurant operations, capacity, menu and perceptions of our brand. We continue to invest on a scale that is unmatched in our industry. It is an increasing point of differentiation and is foundational to our long-term success. Our franchisees are financially strong and have sufficient access to capital allowing them to co-invest with us to secure our collective future. Through the first six months, we have completed over 330 reimages in the U.S., 350 in Europe, and 230 in APMEA. We continue to be encouraged by the results of our reimage locations around the world. Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translations, which negatively impacted second quarter results by $0.07. At Friday\u2019s exchange rates, we expect third quarter EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.08 to $.10, with a full year negative impact of $0.21 to $0.23. As usual, take this as directional only, because rates will change as we progress throughout the second half of the year. In closing, we remain focused on positively impacting those things within our control, and executing on our strategy that has proven to be a winning formula. We will continue to prudently invest today to drive growth into the future, while our business model is resilient. we are not immune from the effect of the ongoing significant global economic challenges. At the same time, we are making some short-term tax co-adjustments to address the current environment, while continuing to build a solid foundation for long-term success. We will not waver in our commitment to create enduring value for our shareholders and the entire McDonald's system. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy, to begin the Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions) So let\u2019s begin. First is Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the focus on value and the potential impact of profitability. So, in the short and mid-term, what are the risks that you have to meaningfully invest your margins from here to achieve the traffic results you\u2019re looking for? And then in the long-term, how do you balance any potential risk for the McDonald\u2019s brand itself in Europe and the world \u2013 when you refocusing the conversation on value and [sensibly] training consumers who want to pay less for your products?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Michael, this is Don. Just, first of all thanks for the question. A couple of different things, relative to value this is part of a \u2013 its part of the platform relative to any of the media expenditures in any one of the countries that we operate in. So, value is not a new thing. The question is how much you address it relative to your marketing and media mix. The other thing that we have to do is to make sure that we have a consistent value platform. So, we have talked about consistently last year and this year, several markets, whether they\u2019d be Australia, which was facing some economic difficulties in tough times and the need to have a consistent value base and now they have loose change, which was implemented really at the end of the first quarter and really into the beginning of the second quarter. We talked about Germany relative to McDeals. Our new Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton was just out with them. And it is in a feeling value to consumers. At the same time, we mentioned that we have to also have a premium product messaging in the marketplace. And so we have not given up on that. All it is a tweak if you would relative to our media expenditures. But we\u2019ll continue to talk about the premium products, whether it would be in the U.S., Australia, Germany, Japan, France, any of these markets.\nKathy Martin: All right, thank you. Next question is David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS Investment Bank: Good morning, guys.\nDon Thompson: Good morning David.\nDavid Palmer \u2013 UBS Investment Bank: Just a question on the cost side, when I listened to other global consumer companies often on the stable side, they talk about managing the cost and scrutinizing CapEx particularly as the going get tough. I was wondering and thinking, as you think about these coming years, it doesn\u2019t look like this environment is going to be easy going forward. And right now McDonald\u2019s is in a, what it looks like to be an investment phase both on the overhead side and the CapEx side. Is that aside when it comes to cash flow and P&L are you thinking about those things and thinking about scrutinizing those a little bit more as you kind of settle into a reality that\u2019s tougher?\nDon Thompson: David, that\u2019s a good question. First of all, I\u2019ll say, around McDonald\u2019s we\u2019ve always had a practice of securitizing the costs. So while you reference the investment in overhead, I think we try to make it clear while we talked about the $100 million of incremental G&A this year that, that\u2019s not necessarily a run rate that you can project into the future. Two of those items, the Olympic and the Convention are isolated to 2012 and our investments in technology while those will continue the rate of increase relative to prior year, next year will not be at the same level that it was this year. So take those things aside, we were always scrutinizing cost and looking to be as effective and reallocate cost to drive more sales as we can. Regarding CapEx, while you indicate the environment going forward maybe a little tougher, we don\u2019t see a fundamental shift in our business model. And so we continue to know that if we reimage our restaurants, we will create that brand differentiation, we know that even in these environments there continues to be increasing demand for brand McDonald's going forward. So we will continue to build new restaurants where we see there is to be good opportunities then we can generate good returns. So well, we are a little more cautious going forward, we don\u2019t see a dramatic change.\nKathy Martin: All right. Thank you. Next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I also wanted to come back at the margin questions, maybe just a little more specifically, your global comps are 3.7 this quarter, so nearly 4% in that than you had in the store level including food costs now, you didn\u2019t really lever labor and some of the other items, and on the franchise side, you got a little bit of leverage, but not much. So is this just an expression of the minimum comp you need and we have a view that comps are going to go now below this and so in the third quarter, is there a risk to de-levering those items or going back to the prior question, are you able to flex? And then secondly, since you talked about food cost pressures abating in the back half, which is good news, obviously, the current commodity market doesn\u2019t suggest that\u2019s going to stay good news for long, can you maybe comment about your early views about \u201913 in that context? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Hey, John, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the flex piece and then ask Pete to talk a little more specifically about margins. One of the things that we do on a routine basis is we have clearly reviews and visits with all of the markets around the world particularly our top 10 markets. And what we really talk about is where they are positioned in terms of the opportunity to grow the business. As we look at the totality of all the markets, we then make any adjustments or capital allocations, reallocations, necessary for us to go to the real market opportunity, but always being mindful of what\u2019s taking place from consumer a level. So there are markets today then initially we began out thinking we would deploy even more capital into, but right now, we may not be performing at a level to manage that kind of capital based upon comparable sales increases and therefore returns. So we on a constant basis, look at each of the markets and how we will flex in and out in terms of any of the investments that we make. And then I\u2019ll ask Pete to speak to some of your margin questions.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, John, regarding the commodities, our supply chain folks, our suppliers, our treasury folks really spend a lot of time earlier this year in looking at the markets and did a great job in securing a lot of our grains and other commodities at cost before they ran up related to the recent drought. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to lower our outlook for this year and you can imagine, while we won\u2019t get into specific details, we\u2019ve taken a greater amount of coverage for the next year, sitting here at this time, than we did half a year ago. So we feel pretty good that the impacts from the drought are going to be minimized, our next year\u2019s results as well to the extent we can see that sitting here today. But as you referenced, margins are still a top line game. And so they are dramatically impacted by our comp sales and to the extent the comp sales soften, that\u2019s where you see that deleveraging.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nAshwin Gorur Shandilya \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, this is Ashwin Shandilya filling in for Jeff. I just wanted to ask basically, in Europe where you\u2019re emphasizing more value in other markets as well. Using history as a guide, can you maybe talk about the consumer response such are focused in the short-term? I mean, I know maybe some pressure on the average check in the short-term, but for how long does that occur before customers refer it back to more normal delivering behavior. And secondly, are there major markets where you\u2019re perhaps being more or less aggressive on value and what are the expectations of those markets. Thanks very much.\nDon Thompson: Thanks for the question. There are certain markets that we have focused quite intensively on, this year and also the latter part of last year to establish what we call as a value platform and we\u2019ve talked about some of those markets, Australia, Germany where we knew consumer confidence was really in question relative to the expenditures and they also have a higher propensity for savings. France, we've talked about relative to consumer confidence in the event of austerity measures. Japan, we\u2019ve talked about relative to what they come through now in this post-recovery from the Tsunami, they\u2019re also in a tough economic environment, and clearly markets like the Spain\u2019s and Italy\u2019s of the world, and at southern part of Europe that are having some difficulties. In the U.S., value will always be a major factor, but we have to balance it as one of the earlier questions was mentioned, with premium products, with some of the beverages to offset some of the potential erosion in margin. relative to how long it takes before you recover and what you see initially. Typically, when you bring forward a new value platform, as I mentioned in the comments, customers are not used to that. in some times, I think it\u2019s going to go away. so what they begin to do initially is that they will use that menu from a purchase intent perspective much more slow initially. That usually does vain, sometimes, it may take six months; sometimes, it may take a little less or little more depending upon the overall economic situation in the country.\nKathy Martin: Okay. Our next question is Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse: Thanks. I have a question just more about the branded affordability in the U.S. I know you just talked about how it\u2019s always been a major factor, always been important. But one of the things that was mentioned in the call was, should the food-away-from-home inflation kind of come in at the low end of your expectation, it may limit your ability to take some pricing in the second half. Just looking back over the last couple of years, I think it\u2019s interesting because after several years of running below food-away-from-home inflation kind of year-to-date, you\u2019ve been kind of in line, maybe even slightly above. and thinking longer-term, how do we think about the broad-based positioning against that? And kind of may be regardless of the outlook, should we think of a low-cost pricing environment in the U.S. to continue to maybe come back some of the competitiveness?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Keith, there are a couple of things and Pete may have a comment on this as well. So food away from home is one \u2013 it\u2019s the baseline, it\u2019s the most predominant measure that we\u2019ve historically reuse. But I have to say this, we\u2019ve also used food at home from a grocery store price index perspective, as well as commodity costs and labor costs. And so what we have to do is, look at what we think will be \u2013 what will be within the range of price sensitivity and acceptable to a consumers which has typically been food away from home. But also we have to look at what the direction of commodity. So if commodities like they\u2019re going to really ramp up. We want to make sure we\u2019re in a position to minimize the impact of margin erosion by taking appropriate price increases. There are times when we will bump up against as you mentioned food away from home or even for a very short period, we may actually eclipse it, but we\u2019ll bring that right back in line. And that\u2019s just part of the ongoing management of what\u2019s taking place in a broader marketplace in terms of food costs, labor pressures, and then understanding what\u2019s happening with consumer confidence and disposable income.\nPeter J. Bensen: And I think Keith, it also \u2013 it\u2019s fair to assume in that kind of pricing equation if you will or pricing formula, we do look at what\u2019s going on the menu boards at the competition. So, the competitive environment does, also factor into it, but Don highlighted that, it\u2019s the more macro factors that we do look at.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Matt Difrisco from Lazard.\nMatthew Difrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets: Thank you. Pete, I wondered if you could talk about the dynamic of the franchise margin in the U.S., and try and help us understand maybe how that looks going forward, as far as it\u2019s been a several quarters of a run of margin expansion on the franchise side in the U.S. and now it\u2019s sort of flat year-over-year. You can put that into the context of what, how those \u2013 how that dynamic works going forward in an environment where \u2013 I think in the press release you said that the same store sales are going to be a little or guided to be a little slower in July and ahead than they were in 2Q?\nPeter J. Bensen: All right, Matt. First, let me \u2013 July, and I know this is generally out there, but July we are facing a negative 1.8% trade day impact. So that is impacting July, as well as the fact that Ramadan is staring \u2013 started last week, so we are going to have 10 days impact of Ramadan this year in July when that was entirely in August last year. So those were a couple of things to think about when reflecting on that July guidance. But as we said earlier, the same thing applies to franchise margins even more so that applies to company operated margins is that they are a top line gain. So they\u2019re really driven, we get tremendous leverage when we are driving comps and they tend to slowdown as comp sales slow. The other thing specific to the U.S. is with the reimaging that\u2019s going on. We are seeing a greater increase in depreciation expense. But typically depreciation is one of those fixed costs that you could leverage with the increased sales, but with the progression of increasing the reimagings, we are continuing to layer on some additional depreciation expense, that will continue in to the near future.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Joe Buckley from Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Pete, I was wondering if maybe you\u2019ve done this already, but could you breakdown the $100 million of G&A among the three things you\u2019ve mentioned, the April convention, the Olympics and the technology program?\nDon Thompson: So, Joe, we\u2019ve somewhat broken it down, and that we\u2019ve said, half of that relates to the convention in the Olympics and the other half relates to the IT investment.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.\nMitch J. Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thanks very much. And I\u2019d like to ask another question about margins. In the global margin at the store level, I believe it was down about 80 bps. And Pete, is it possible just to give us a sense of maybe how much of that contraction was due to increased focus on value? And as we look out over the next couple of quarters, do you expect that emphasis to heighten or are we kind of there already? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Mitch, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint precisely how much of that is related to our increased focus on value. And specifically, Don, alluded to this a little bit, when we say value, it\u2019s not just that entry point value, so it\u2019s not just the dollar menu or the one euro items in that menus. It\u2019s also some of those premium food events that are a relative value compared to the rest of the marketplace. So I know we talk a lot about value to drive transactions and the implications there, that is the entry level value and a lot of that is, but it also has different forms across the menu board. But I would say that as we focus more over these next couple of quarters, it is likely that the impact will be a little bit more, will be greater in the next couple of quarters.\nDon Thompson: Hi, Mitch, just one point on this one is, what we\u2019re facing now from a global economic perspective is, we\u2019re just seeing more markets that have consumer confidence issues, and what we will consider to be more substantial levels. so this notion of value and the way we\u2019re talking about branded affordability, while it is not necessarily new in all of the markets, what we\u2019re finding is that we have to again quake up our messaging, our GRPs, our marketing spend just a little bit more to appeal to some of these consumers who frankly have less confidence in the overall economy, and therefore reduce the disposable spending. and so, that\u2019s why we\u2019re having as many conversations about it. But having said that, we've been doing this in each of these markets over time, so it's not \u2013 they're not typically new things, there are a couple of markets where it's new, Japan let\u2019s say or in Australia with loose change, but particularly as they\u2019ve been in France, the U.S. has had a value based menu, Germany\u2019s had SMS. What we\u2019re finding is we may need to quack that up just a little bit more to appeal to some of these consumers. This is the time for us to really focus on guest count growth and market share gains. And so we\u2019d really go at this very hard in times like these even though that means an investment.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi, great. Thanks. First, just a really quick follow-up and then the question. Pete, when is that IT investment recur in fiscal \u201813 or is it the $100 million gone from fiscal \u201913, so that\u2019s the first question? And then secondly, just thinking about the UK, I mean obviously, there is the Jubilee and the Olympics and there has just been so much kind of going on into that market overall. I mean how do you think about the UK in general and in the second half of the year and in the \u201813 and is McDonald\u2019s doing anything proactive to perhaps prepare for, I don\u2019t know if that happens or not, but a slowdown like it happened in the UK for the rest of Europe as some of these events come in the past?\nPeter J. Bensen: Hey, John, I'll take the first part of your question, and then Don can give you a perspective on the UK But the $50 million incremental technology investment spending this year, that will stay in our base and that level of spending will recur next year. So to say it differently, $50 million for the Olympics and conventions does not repeat next year, but the technology spent continues, but obviously, at a zero increase, if we spend the same amount. With that, I\u2019ll ask Don to talk about the UK.\nDon Thompson: Hi, John, Beijing \u2013 so if I look back to Beijing, Vancouver, post the Olympics, what we typically do is, we go back to business as usual. So we don\u2019t foresee a huge shift or change in terms of our base trim line in the UK as we move forward. Having said that, the UK will be facing some tougher austerity measures in the latter half of the year, and so as those things come into play, we\u2019ve got to again make sure, we\u2019re looking at all of the macro economic factors in the market and making appropriate adjustments. We\u2019ve done quite well in the UK, we\u2019re balancing our growth across all the menu tiers and that will continue. But we\u2019ll have to continue to look at the market, but right now, we don\u2019t foresee anything that will cause a substantial change in the base trend line.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason Taylor West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks guys. I just wanted to talk about the U.S. market a little bit, you\u2019ve obviously seen somewhat a down shift in the sales trend though the others are still healthy. You\u2019ve seen a slow down from the last couple of quarters. If you could talk about how much of that is kind of a consumer macro driven, I\u2019ve seen people trading down to the dollar menu, value menu, things like that versus competitive activity that you\u2019ve alluded to. It seems like the competitive activity not necessarily value oriented all the time, some of its new product oriented and just marketing oriented. If you can just kind of compare that to maybe other periods of slow down? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Great question, Jason. A couple of things, we\u2019re seeing a hike in competitive activity across the IEO marketplace, which is an interesting point because it\u2019s not just in QSR, we are seeing it across all of IEO from fast-casual to convenience and grocery stores. I haven\u2019t said that, for us as McDonald's what matters most is to remain focused on what\u2019s within our realm of control. So we will talk about the value platforms, we talked about beverages, breakfast, we talk about premium based products and promotional food events like McBites. We\u2019ve just got to make sure that we are appealing the customers more so, but we are seeing to your point, we are seeing that competition. Now, the other thing is that there is an increase in terms of marketing spend by many of the folks in the competitive segment. So we have to clearly be able to make sure that our strength of voice and our share of voice is still resonating with consumers out there and we build awareness for the McDonald's brand. So this is not new, we go through competitive fresher\u2019s and there will resurgences and a kind of ebbs and flow from time to time. But what it means for us is we just got to be focused on our business plan and execute that at the highest level.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndy M. Barish \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.: Yeah, can you just give us a little sense on sort of the China business, how much the last quarter slowdown was kind of \u2013 your thoughts internally, more value kind of value dinner having a negative impact on mix et cetera versus sort of the external environment, if there is a way you are sort of looking at that?\nDon Thompson: Yeah, Andy, relative to China, so clearly we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a slowdown economically and we talked about the Tier 1 cities, which is where we are, which is where our presence is absolutely the strongest, it\u2019s where we are concentrated. Those markets seem to be facing much stronger macro economic pressures than clearly the Tier 3s, 4s, those cities that are outside of the core in terms of where our focus has been. So we are seeing some macro economic pressures. On the value side, we are seeing a little bit more media and marketing around value-based products. Clearly, I think we are in a pretty good position there relative to the overall marketplace in China. But the other thing is that, for us, it\u2019s got to be consistent when you execute value. So, if you look at last May, June timeframe, we were running 13% and 16% comps. And so as we went into this year, we knew that those were fairly high hurdles. Nonetheless, if we execute the existing value lunch strategy, value dinner adding strategy; breakfast is our fastest growing take part in China. We\u2019ll continue to do well in the marketplace. But we have focused on a little bit more based on consumer confidence measures. We have focused a little bit more on a value side in China as well.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.\nHoward W. Penney \u2013 Hedgeye Risk Management LLC: Hi, thanks very much. I was wondering if you might be able to quantify what you are seeing in the global markets as you\u2019ve described in the call today, the slowdown anyway that you are seeing from the consumer, because you\u2019ve done 5.4% comps for the six month this year, your worst year in the last five was 2008 at 3.8% for you or 2009 at 3.8%. So, you\u2019re doing, I think significantly better and you had a better earnings performances, I don\u2019t believe you missed the numbers back in 2008, 2009. So, what is that in the global marketplace that you are seeing is causing the issue McDonald\u2019s is seeing, from a top line perspective you\u2019re doing much better than what is arguably a far more difficult economic environment in 2008, 2009?\nPeter J. Bensen: Howard, couple other things, one is that we started this year and we had the benefit of the leap year and we had the benefit of the unusually warm winter, in a lot of places around the world. So the first quarter while it was strong, there were a couple of things that boosted that beyond the wherewithal normal performance churn event. But as you look around the world, I\u2019d say, one of the changes is just the length of this economic challenging period. Back in \u201908 and \u201909, I think people thought this was an issue, it was going to come, it was going to go, it didn\u2019t dramatically change consumer behavior. They did change some, but not dramatically, and I think now, that it\u2019s persistent for so long, and especially in Europe, it\u2019s gotten so much deeper in some of these countries that it is really starting to constrain consumer behavior, several of the markets there, the Eating Out market is just simply declining. People are staying at home, they aren\u2019t going out and the magnitude of the issues in Europe are having ripple effects around the world. And the most significant is, it is impacting the consumer\u2019s behavior and whether that means they are saving more or they\u2019re just going out less. All in all it is meaning more flattish to declining eating out generally around the world.\nDon Thompson: An interesting point, we look at it quite often is, we\u2019ve been at points what we\u2019ve seen is one or two markets of our top 10, maybe three or four that might be experiencing some of these consumer confidence issues, this is one of the first times when we\u2019ve seen in a much broader base perspective, so it\u2019s a little bit more than European cold, if you would, it\u2019s kind of a little bit more a global piece that we\u2019re seeing, across the board. So what all it means for us is that the things that we\u2019ve employed historically, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re in the best position again to drive in, additional traffic in the restaurant to be able to trade those up, but we\u2019re making substantial investments to be able to do that now in all of the markets that we\u2019ve talked about. And we\u2019re seeing some results in terms of some of that the guest count movement, but we may not necessarily see those sales flow down to bottom line until we\u2019ve got into a point where we can really trade those guest counts up.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar.\nR.J. Hottovy \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.: Good morning. And I just wanted to follow-up on the product pipeline that Don had mentioned in the U.S. You gave some hints about some new products that maybe in the pipeline. but maybe the broader question just more specifically what we may be seeing in the back half of the year in 2013, and based on the success of McBites program earlier in the year, there\u2019s any learnings or any product platforms you\u2019ve seen elsewhere in the world that may be successful or do you think, it may have potential is the U.S. just any commentary on that would be helpful? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah. R.J., a couple of them, you guys have seen that we\u2019ve showed at whether it was a NIM or some of you saying these in business to the innovation center et cetera. but clearly the beverage platform, we\u2019re seeing has quite a bit of resonance and it is being looked at by many markets around the world as we move forward there. But also wraps it\u2019s a platform, you guys have seen the wraps, the wraps are being looked at in many markets around the world, we\u2019re in quite a few countries across Europe right now, but the variations in the wrap whether beef or chicken, your ability even going to shrimp and fish have been quite tremendous, we\u2019ve even done some breakfast work with those wraps as I mentioned today. So we\u2019re seeing those kind of platforms move around quite a bit. On the premium sandwich side, that was \u2013 I think it was at the Investor Meeting, we showed you guys a burger called the Pub Burger in the U.S., those type sandwiches that are more premium beef sandwiches and we can also do premium chickens are some of the sandwiches that have resonated in Europe. And so you can look forward to seeing some sandwiches similar to that, next year for sure impossibly, possibly even the latter part of this year.\nKathy Martin: And our next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara H. Senatore \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Hi, thank you. I wanted to sort of ask the question about the unit growth that you are seeing, you mentioned them growing in emerging markets and then you also subsequently made comments about thinking about allocating CapEx and making sure that the returns are there. I guess when I think about your growth algorithm, the one you laid out, and you said \u2013 that you expect to return too. It\u2019s usually I think has some low single-digit comps, or a single-digit unit growth with the top line. I\u2019m just trying to understand, if your growth shifts more toward emerging markets, shouldn\u2019t that mean that for any given amount of unit growth, you probably have less of a contribution to the top line, because they tend to be either lower volume or in the case of Latin America license. So should we be thinking, will that mix become more pronounced over time, I guess this is the question, so that your system wide unit growth may increase, but it will have a diminishing impact on your revenue growth?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Sara. So we talked about Brazil, I highlighted Brazil as one of those countries, but in Brazil as a development licensee, it was the only country that I have mentioned in large part that is a development licensee wholly from that perspective, When you look at the other countries we\u2019re growing in, whether it be China, yes, lower average unit volumes, but we\u2019re growing quite aggressively as you know in China, the growth that we have in some of the others, the India\u2019s and the Russia\u2019s, other world. In India, we have a developmental licensee and a joint partner; in Russia, that is a wholly-owned market, so it\u2019s all McOpCo; the U.S. we have a mix; markets like France we have a similar mix and closer to that 80% to 90% franchise kind of a range, but it is the traditional franchise. So, we have growth across many markets and the ownership structures are a little different. So as we look at the allocation of capitals, we're looking how we can get maximum returns, but we are also look into see what customers want more McDonald's. That\u2019s the first and most important thing, where are the true growth opportunities to build the business and build a system wide sales.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Phillip Juhan from BMO Capital Markets.\nPhillip A. Juhan \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Yeah. Thanks guys. This is Phillip Juhan at BMO. Pete, I was hoping you can may be quantify some of the labor wage rate pressure you\u2019re seeing and where that might be the most secured in terms of geography, it\u2019s a little tough to reconcile with 2% to 3% pricing in place. How you guys are actually thinking, deleverage on that line against the back drop of sort of economic softness in general?\nPeter J. Bensen: Phillip, we're seeing wage pressure in virtually every market around the world. U.S. there continues to be increases in the average rate. I think there were seven states that hit normal wage at the beginning of the year at a 4% to 5% clip, which are impacting that. In addition in the U.S. we continue during the quarter to invest labor enrolling in the peek hour and so that added a little bit of pressure to the labor line. If you go into Europe, not only our wage is increasing but some of the austere measures in Europe include, additional social charges, an additional payroll type taxes, that are putting pressure on the wage rates. And in Asia, a lot has been written about China and the pressure on wages there, so we're experiencing wage pressure there as well, so it\u2019s clearly a global phenomenon for us.\nKathy Martin: All right. We\u2019re about out of time but we\u2019ve got a couple additional folks in the queue. So, we\u2019re going to take these next couple of questions; Joe Buckley from Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yeah, just want to ask about the European same store sales increase in the month of June, actually it was pretty strong and you mentioned McDeal in Germany, but when more value initiatives in place, what sort of the timing of the \u2013 [you said about] focus on value in Europe?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. Couple of different things, clearly in Germany, SMS and we talked about this back, I think it was April or May, SMS has been stepped up. We have to put more marketing dollars, immediate dollars behind it. Also they created the \u20ac3.79 McDeal. So Germany, they did implement that albeit toward the end of the second quarter. In France, Petit Plaisir is across the Board now. It\u2019s something else that we had mentioned and what they don\u2019t have yet is a one sandwich type price point value but their base value platform is Petit Plaisir. So we haven\u2019t gone all the way to Eurosaver there. At this stage, the franchisees are discussing next steps. But we believe we\u2019re in a pretty good competitive position in France right now. The UK has continued on Eurosaver\u2019s. Markets like Spain and Italy are in a value proposition called Uno por Uno, and I would tell you Spain has executed this quite well over the last several years and they are performing well even in the state that the economy in Spain has had, but there are other markets. Italy is a tough market for us. Italy right now even with the value proposition for those of you who visited Italy, you know there is a lot of street side cafes and their value proposition is a lower tier even than what we proposed at McDonald\u2019s Uno por Uno. So, we have to continue to try to see how we can breakthrough in a marketplace like that. So it does vary a bit, but we are seeing some early results nonetheless we have to stay diligent in all of those markets.\nKathy Martin: And our final question is from Peter Saleh from Telsey Advisory Group.\nPeter Saleh \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great thanks. I know it\u2019s a little early to be talking about 2014, just wondering what your thoughts are on healthcare costs and if you have any kind of estimates around what that could do on a per unit basis. And what steps could you take in 2013 to kind of get ahead of that.\nPeter J. Bensen: Peter, our current estimate is healthcare is going to impact each individual restaurant in the range of $10,000 to $30,000. That obviously a wide range, but there is a lot of different factors when you look at the healthcare law that impacts the number of employees, the number of full time employees, what is the current healthcare offering from the owner operator for McOpCo. So there are a lot of variables, but I will tell you that we are significantly increasing now that the Supreme Court has ruled increasing our conversation and disclosures with franchisees around what this mean for brand McDonald's. So that they can be as educated as possible around what\u2019s happening so that they can start to anticipate and make any changes that they have to try to minimize the impact of this. And on a just a dollar basis that $10,000 to $30,000, we have years like last year where commodity cost increases were even greater than that. So while this is a significant item and it\u2019s gaining a lot of attention as the P&L item we\u2019ve managed through items of this magnitude in the past and I\u2019m hopeful we can do that in future.\nKathy Martin: All right. I\u2019ll turn it over to Don now with the few closing comments.\nDon Thompson: First, I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, we continue to deliver solid results, because the entire McDonald\u2019s system, franchisees and supplier partners, company employees, it is the most aligned it has ever been as we continue to execute our plan to win, and the three global priorities that we\u2019ve established in optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our brand. I\u2019m also confident that with our solid strategic plans to gain market share over the long-term and the experienced senior leadership team that we have and the ongoing communications we have with franchisees, we\u2019ll continue to grow the business for the system and for our shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to our long-term strategies as we make smart and strategic decisions to mitigate short-term pressures in these challenging times. So, again, thanks for joining us today. And have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-04-20 14:30:07", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin -  James A.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner; Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast.  And before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on our website, www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are any reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. So now I'd like to turn it over to Jim. Jim?\nJames A. Skinner: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you know, I recently announced my retirement after 41 years with McDonald's and almost 8 years as CEO. The time was right for me to make this decision as our business continues to be very strong.  For the quarter, comparable sales were up 7.3%; operating income increased 9% in constant currencies; and EPS reached $1.23, an 8% increase in constant currencies. Our system is aligned and focused and we have an outstanding leader in Don to step in and continue our momentum. I'm extremely confident in Don and his leadership team, and I know the business is in very capable hands. I also know that our system of outstanding operators, suppliers and employees will continue working together to drive our results. And let me say it's been a pleasure working with all of you in the investment community over these years. I appreciate your continued engagement and your interest our business, as well as your thoughtfulness when you put together your viewpoints and your assessment of McDonald's. I wish you all well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Don to discuss the quarter's results around the world.\nDonald Thompson: Thanks, Jim. And thank you for your tremendous leadership and all you've done for McDonald's. You're a terrific partner, a mentor, and you'll definitely be missed. Well, good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest quarterly results, which reflect the strength of our business. Our continued momentum remains a system-wide effort with positive trends continuing in every area of the world.  In the U.S., comparable sales increased 8.9% for the quarter and operating income rose 10%. Europe's comparable sales were up 5% and operating income grew 8% in constant currencies. And in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or what we call APMEA, comp sales grew 5.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing into April, with global comparable sales growth expected to be about 4%. We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds we've faced on both the top and bottom lines, and the fact that we'll continue to face these headwinds throughout the rest of the year. The economic climate remains challenging, with varying degrees of consumer confidence, economic pressures and inflationary costs. And our success in this volatile environment is a testament to our Plan to Win and our relentless focus on customers' needs. Around the world, we continue to gain market share in an industry with minimal to negative growth. We also remain committed to our proven plan and to executing against our 3 global priorities, which are optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to brand McDonald's. In the U.S., our strong sales were the result of a focus on our core and new products, as well as value and convenience. The mild winter weather also benefited sales and traffic, but to a lesser extent. This momentum helped offset some of the headwinds and margin challenges we're facing due to pressures like commodities that we've mentioned before.  We continued to meet our customers' desire for a great breakfast during the quarter by advertising our increasingly popular wholesome choices menu, which includes a great selection of items with no more than 300 calories each, like our oatmeal, the Egg McMuffin, and Fruit 'N Yogurt Parfait. We also featured our iconic Big Mac, which lifted sales of both Big Macs and Mac Snack Wraps. In January, the U.S. launched Chicken McBites, a bite-sized chicken offering. McBites contributed to the growth of the overall chicken sales by providing a tasty solution that is shareable and a great snack. We often say that the power of our system lies in our ability to learn from each other, then share, then scale ideas, and McBites is a great example of that. The product originated in Australia, and its positioning as a promotional food event came out of Europe. This approach significantly reduces time-to-market compared with developing a product from scratch. You can expect to see us share even more menu ideas, given the strong global pipeline that we can tap into.  The U.S. also continues to strengthen its position as a beverage destination, with total beverage units up 6% over last year. And in the weeks ahead, we'll be enhancing our McCaf\u00e9 blended ice lineup with a new Cherry Berry Chiller. It's a refreshing new drink made with 100% juice. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to broaden accessibility by evolving its value proposition with the new Extra Value Menu. This menu builds on the iconic Dollar Menu by offering a great selection of products at various value price points, from Snack Wraps under $2 to 20-piece McNuggets at $4.99. We're also focused on maximizing restaurant throughput and capacity. More than 1/3 of all restaurants are leveraging a form of multiple order points, including tandem or side-by-side drive-thrus, along with nearly 1,200 handheld order takers. Now let's turn to Europe, a region that continues to experience unprecedented economic challenges from widespread austerity measures, concerns over the sovereign debt crisis and unemployment levels averaging about 10%. Our business has held strong despite the impact of the environment and what it's having on consumers' purchasing power. We remain focused, however, on upgrading the overall experience and are continuously looking to provide even greater value across our menu. From entry-level to core and premium products, we have to provide value to ensure we remain relevant in this environment. In the area of menu, Europe has led the way with limited-time offers that we call promotional food events. This quarter, France featured 2 premium beef sandwiches, the McFarmer and McTimber, which resonated with customers. In the U.K., strong promotions around the Big Tasty beef sandwich and our 20-piece McNuggets ShareBox exceeded our expectations, as did Germany's re-hit of the 1955 burger. Considering the ongoing pressures on consumers and our focus on maintaining and growing guest counts, we've stepped up our emphasis on branded affordability. Germany's newly evolved value menu contributed to sales during the quarter, which helped offset increased competitive value offers. In the U.K., sales from the Saver Menu grew double-digits versus the prior year. And France is also evaluating options to further strengthen value perceptions at a time when a number of new austerity measures are impacting consumers' confidence and their disposable income. Europe continues to lead the systems reimaging efforts. 80% of our interiors and 50% of our exteriors have been refreshed, elevating perceptions of the McDonald's brand and strengthening appeal with today's consumers. And we continue to broaden our accessibility through the rollout of the new point-of-sale system across Europe and the expansion of McCaf\u00e9s. Approximately 150 more will be added this year. As we said before, our holistic approach to the business and attention to evolving consumer needs serves us well in these times of austerity and economic uncertainty and for the long-term growth of the region. Now over to APMEA, where we're also seeing challenging economic conditions with slow growth in China and ongoing tightening in Australia. We're managing through the environment with a focus on compelling menu offerings, strong value and convenience. Australia is focused on branded affordability, particularly the Value Lunch program, has been key to its solid gains in this quarter. In March, we launched the Loose Change menu. This menu features 7 items ranging from a soft-serve ice cream cone at AUD $0.30 to a Double Cheeseburger at AUD $2. And early results are encouraging. We also had some new food news in the market, with the introduction of our new Spicy Chicken McBites, smoothies and frapp\u00e9s. Australia is the first market in APMEA to launch these blended ice drinks, and as we've seen elsewhere, these products are a hit, selling above our expectations.  Japan's results remain uneven, as the recovery from last year's devastating events continues and consumers are eating at home more often. Strong support of our core products, compelling limited-time offers and a focus on breakfast have contributed to hard-sought market share gains in a retracting industry. Our Big Mac promotion helped boost sales and lift average check, and a focus on our Premium Roast Coffee and popular menu items like the Sausage McMuffin and hotcakes during the morning hours have ensured that breakfast remains a strong contributor to Japan's results. We expect short-term volatility will continue but remain optimistic about Japan for the long term. And while China's economy is still expected to grow at about 8% in 2012, this is a slowdown from last year's growth of just over 9%, with much of this attributed to a reduction in exports. McDonald's China delivered first quarter comparable sales of 8.5%. We remain committed to offering great value and local menu favorites to continue to drive our results. Our Value Lunch is a staple in the minds of Chinese consumers, and the addition of the chicken burger has helped keep the momentum going, driving lunchtime comp sales by double-digits. We will also be launching a value dinner program in the coming months. Value is also delivering results at breakfast, and helped grow comparable sales by over 20% for this important daypart. Beyond breakfast, we ran a series of successful menu promotions around Chinese New Year that provided a lift in overall sales and traffic. APMEA remains a region of tremendous growth and opportunity. We remain excited about our future potential in this growing region as we build on our menu and value and extend the convenience of our brand through drive-thru, delivery, kiosks and extended hours, as well as new restaurant development. All in all, we continue to strengthen our business and build on our success in a strategic and a comprehensive way. We're equally committed to maintaining a strong financial foundation and maximizing value for our system and for our shareholders. These are the hallmarks of how we have and will continue to manage our business. Our long-term average annual targets remain intact, with sales growth of 3% to 5%, operating income growth of 6% to 7% and return on incrementally invested capital in the high-teens. Our intent remains to return all of our cash flow, after reinvesting in the business, to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In fact, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. Overall, I'm pleased with our latest quarterly results. However, I also know there's much more work to be done. With a fragile global economy and numerous pressures to contend with, we're staying focused on those things within our control. We remain committed to executing our Plan to Win and delivering an exceptional experience for our nearly 68 million customers per day. Next week, we will be with Owner/Operators from around the world at our biennial convention. This meeting provides a great opportunity to share ideas and also solidify plans for today and for the future. The fundamentals of our business are strong, our system is aligned, and I am confident that together we will deliver continued growth. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Pete.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. We start 2012 where we left off in 2011, with strong sales momentum and market share growth around the world. We are guided by the Plan to Win and our 3 global priorities: optimizing the menu, modernizing the experience and broadening accessibility. We continue to approach our business holistically and see many opportunities ahead, even as we manage through a volatile and inflationary environment. Our strong performance and balance sheet enables investments in key system initiatives to help sustain our momentum over the long term. As we outlined at our investor meeting last November, we are willing and able to invest for continued growth and to widen our competitive advantages, recognizing that in the short term, these investments along with other near-term headwinds will impact our 2012 operating income growth. We believe our strategies and focused execution are right for the business and will create significant shareholder value over the coming years. We are pleased with the first quarter results, which were led by a 10% constant currency increase in system-wide sales amidst a challenging economic landscape. Combined operating margin rose 10 basis points to 30% due to strong comparable sales, mostly offset by higher costs. The largest component of operating income is our franchise margin, representing nearly 70% of total restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margin dollars rose $135 million to over $1.7 billion, a 10% constant currency increase, with every area of the world contributing. Consolidated franchise margin percent rose 40 basis points to 82.3%, as positive comparable sales more than offset higher costs. Please note there was a change in classification of certain franchising costs in Australia beginning in first quarter. This negatively affected APMEA's franchise margin percent by about 40 basis points but had no impact on overall margin dollars. This change in classification will have a similar impact on APMEA's franchise margin percent for the balance of the year. Global company operated margin dollars grew $42 million to $778 million for the quarter, while the percent decreased 20 basis points to 17.5%. Rising commodity, labor and occupancy costs, particularly in the U.S., offset strong comparable sales. In the U.S., company operated margins declined 70 basis points to 18.8%, primarily due to higher commodity costs. First quarter commodity costs in the U.S. rose 7%, primarily driven by increases in beef. We expect to experience similar pressure in the second quarter, and then easing a bit in the second half of the year. The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 4.5% to 5.5%. The cost increases were partly offset by strong guest count growth and a nearly 1% price increase in February. Combined with last year's price increases, the U.S. business is running about a 3% price increase versus a year ago. While we typically keep price increases similar to or slightly below food-away-from-home inflation index, we also keep a close eye on food-at-home inflation, which has been rising faster than food-away-from-home. We remain mindful of balancing future price increases with our desire to maintain growth in guest counts and market share. In addition, in first quarter, we invested in local value promotions to drive sales. We also invested in labor to build capacity, primarily during peak hours. This contributed to a significant improvement in guest count growth for the quarter during the critical noon to 1 p.m. hour. Providing compelling value throughout our menu and increasing peak hour capacity are critical components to our long-term growth. In first quarter, these initiatives impacted our ability to realize greater margin leverage despite strong comp sales. All of these headwinds are expected to continue as we anticipate similar U.S. company operated margin percent declines at least through the second quarter. Turning to Europe. Company operated margins increased 30 basis points to 17.5%, as solid comparable sales more than offset higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Very strong comparable sales increases in Russia and the U.K., our 2 largest McOpCo markets in Europe, drove the margin expansion. Europe's grocery bill was up about 5% in the quarter. We expect a little less of an increase in second quarter, with the full year increase still projected at 2.5% to 3.5%. Though Europe is facing less overall commodity inflation compared to the U.S., the impact of austerity measures is weighing on both our top and bottom lines. Across Europe, the average price increase for the trailing 12 months, excluding Russia, is about 2% to 3%. We do not currently have as much pricing power in Europe and in key markets, such as France and Germany, where we are evolving our value offerings and messaging to address growing consumer needs. The combination of all these factors is expected to pressure company operated margins over the next few quarters. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins declined 60 basis points to 16.9%, as strong comparable sales were offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. In addition, the new restaurant openings in China contributed to the lower margin percent. While China's new restaurants pressure margins early on, within a few years of opening, most restaurants generate operating margins that approach the market's average. G&A for the quarter increased 6% in constant currencies. We expect the next 2 quarters will experience more significant increases due to our Worldwide Convention in April, the Summer Olympics starting in late July and the ongoing technology enhancements. With the favorable interest rate environment and our strong credit rating, we are taking advantage of our ability to issue debt at low rates, but we are not changing our philosophy toward our balance sheet. The change in our interest expense outlook is being driven by stronger foreign currencies versus 3 months ago, not an increase in anticipated borrowings for the year. The first quarter effective tax rate of 31.4% represented a significant increase versus the prior year rate of 28.8%, which was aided by a nonrecurring deferred tax benefit related to our foreign operations. We continue to project the full year rate to be between 31% and 33%. We are confident that the investments being made today will build customer loyalty, drive returns and enhance shareholder value over the long term. We're operating from a position of strength and seizing the opportunity to modernize our brand while leveraging our size and scale in a way that others simply cannot match. Our franchisees remained aligned with our strategies and have the capacity and willingness to invest. For example, the average traditional restaurant in the U.S. now generates over $2.5 million in annual sales and $340,000 in pre-debt cash flow. Just 5 years ago, our average volume and cash flow per restaurant were about $2.1 million and $290,000, respectively.  The strong financial foundation of our operators around the world allows them to invest in key strategic initiatives like reimaging. We are on track to reimage at least 2,400 restaurants this year, including 800 in the U.S., 900 in Europe and 475 in APMEA. Through first quarter, we've completed about 350 reimages globally. In addition, we will complete over 200 rebuilds in the U.S. this year. And opening new units also remains a focus because we see significant opportunity to strategically extend our brand. In 2012, we expect to open more than 1,300 new restaurants, including 450 in Latin America, Japan and other markets, where we invest no capital.  Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.01. At current rates, we expect second and third quarter EPS to each be negatively impacted by $0.05 to $0.07, with the full year negative impact ranging from $0.12 to $0.14. As usual, this is directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout the year. We remain committed to making the right long-term decisions for the system and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong, and we are pleased with first quarter results, given the environment. We remain focused on widening our competitive advantages over the coming years. Even with the headwinds in 2012, I'm confident that we can meet our financial targets this year and continue to build significant shareholder value. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Pete. We're ready to open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] So we are ready to begin our Q&A.\nKathy Martin: And we'll start with David Palmer from UBS.\nDavid Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just in case Jim Skinner is not going to be on the second quarter call, just wanted to say thank you and congratulations for a great career. Taco Bell, Burger King, those are a couple of big competitors in the U.S. that are making a big sales go-at-it here heading into the second quarter. I don't normally think about the smaller competitors having a much of an impact on McDonald's, but do you think that, that could be something of a competitive encroachment in the second quarter that we should be thinking about? And secondly, just out of Europe, can you give us a sense of the type of marketing changes you may be already making in places like France and Germany, that more value-oriented marketing that you discussed?\nJames A. Skinner: David, thanks for your comments. And the question regarding the United States, I'll take, and Don can add some texture if he likes and he can talk about the marketing in Europe, which we are managing effectively, as Pete mentioned in his comments and Don also mentioned. But United States, of course, Burger King and Taco Bell and all of our other competitors, we keep a close eye on in terms of what their activities are like. But it's not our first rodeo regarding this. And they have spurts of enthusiasm and excitement for their brand typically when there's a change in ownership. And so they are doing some things that are meaningful for their brand, they believe. And yet we think that it's business-as-usual for McDonald's relative to what we're focused on, and our strategies have served us very, very well. When you look at optimizing the menu, improving customer relevance as we've done, and accessibility and to our Plan to Win, we expect to be able to maintain our competitive differentiation there, regarding those competitors. And Don, you want to talk a little bit about the marketing in Europe?\nDonald Thompson: Yes. Relative to Europe, David, we have had -- we have ongoing conversations with all the markets, not just those in Europe, but relative to what's happening in a broader business environment and how we are faring. One of the things that we've seen thus far is we continue to gain market share across Europe. And so we know that despite some of the IEO growth or lack thereof, we continue to appeal to consumers and customers across-the-board. Now what we've done, particularly in France and Germany, is we have had some, as you would imagine, more aggressive conversations around how we position our value menus and value offerings. In Germany, they've done some things with their basic value menu, which we call SMS. They made some changes there, as well as they, the franchisees, are considering other things that they might want to do to continue the momentum that we've had relative to market share gains. However, I will say consumer confidence is still one of the things we monitor across Europe, inclusive of Germany and France. In France, we have a great opportunity to better leverage our P'tits Plaisirs platform. So you can probably imagine that we will continue to do that, as well as look for other opportunities to continue to move forward the menu and provide good price value. So those are some of the things we're doing there. Just one touch point, and Jim mentioned several things and he's kept us very focused, as you all can imagine, on consistency in terms of how we run the business. So when you mentioned some of the competitors in the U.S. also, we continue to watch our gain there as well. In the U.S., we're up 60 basis points in terms of market share, which is really, really strong growth. And Jan Fields and her team are doing a great job there, as well we continue to have a positive sales comp gap. And so those things are things we also measure to ensure that we're doing the right thing for our customers.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from David Tarantino from R.W. Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Jim, congratulations on your retirement and, Don, congratulations on your new role. My question really is a follow-up related to the Europe business. You saw a nice recovery in the comp trend in March. And I just wanted to understand the underlying dynamics there in the various markets, and if you think that maybe February was more of an anomaly related to weather and that the underlying trend is actually more consistent with what you saw in January and March. And then I guess, secondly, have you already implemented some of these initiatives that you've talked about that may be helping the trend in March? Or are those something that you're planning going forward in anticipation of a tough economy?\nDonald Thompson: David, thanks much. And thanks for the recognition, both of Jim and myself. I'll tell you a couple of different things. One is we have already begun some of the planning. Some of these things were implemented before, and we just have to change some of our marketing emphasis, i.e. in Germany, relative to the value platform. France already had P'tits Plaisirs. However, it does end up being a marketing GRP visibility and awareness play more so than anything else, because we've got the tools and the arsenal already, which is good. We can just lever them up. Now here's the other thing I would say relative to Europe, and you asked about do we think it will continue. Europe, the first quarter had a lot of different pieces in it. Clearly, we had the 200-year weather cycle, which was a negative impact. We have the positive impact of things like bank holidays. We have a lot of moving parts. However, we know that the underlying thing that we have to do is have good price value across-the-board while consumers are facing some confidence issues due to austerity measures, and then some of the other things such as pension issues in the U.K. and taxes and VAT increases across-the-board. So we do have many plans already in place. There are some new things we will put in place, but the biggest part is just how we shift our marketing to enhance the value messaging and awareness.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jason West, Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just wanted to ask on China. You alluded to some modest slowdown there. If you could talk a bit about, is that more regional? I believe during the last recession, you saw more impact in the export-driven markets, if you're seeing sort of a regional impact this time as well. And sort of if you could talk daypart-wise and if there's been any impact from some of the PR issues there recently.\nPeter J. Bensen: Jason, it's Pete. The China business has continued to perform pretty well for us. You know that March was a little slower than the 2-month trend had been, January and February. But there's no specific region or particular issue to point to. One of the things -- we had a big beef promotion this March relative to a big chicken promotion last March so that had a little bit of a negative impact. We did see a little regionalized slowdown after some of the negative publicity you alluded to, but that wasn't terribly significant. So we remain on track there and are comfortable with where we're going.\nKathy Martin: The next question is Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAndrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, just finishing up maybe the European discussion on the -- your thoughts just as it pertains to the margin impact with a little bit more focus on promotion or value going forward. Europe delivered good margins here in the first quarter with Russia and the U.K., as you mentioned. But any subtle shifts kind of as you focus a little bit more on value going forward?\nJames A. Skinner: I think margins, as you know, Andy, are a top line game, and this is all about generating more traffic through the leveraging of our everyday affordability, which Don had mentioned in terms of getting ourselves in the appropriate position and putting the muscle behind it in marketing, particularly in Germany and France. And we think that, that will be beneficial as the traffic increases and the top line grows into the future. And so we don't really look at that as having a significant impact on margins relative to anything we do on everyday affordability.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes. Andy, as you pointed out, it really is kind of a tale of 2 Europes, if you will, with Russia having some high-teen comps and the U.K. around 10%. They really drove some pretty good margin performance here in the first quarter. As we head to second quarter, we obviously, we won't have the leap day benefit. Generally, in the markets that Jim talked about, while we'll enhance our messaging around the local value or the everyday affordability, that tendency is initially you'll see a little dip in the average check. But as the transactions grow, you get that back over time. And in those markets with that environment, we also probably have a little less pricing power as last year's increases roll off and we'll probably be able to take a little bit less this year. Net-net, those are the pressures I alluded to when I mentioned that in my comments.\nKathy Martin: Next question is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a two-part question. First, just as it relates to -- Pete, you mentioned the food-at-home versus food-away-from-home discussion. And I know the gap has been fairly wide, which gave you guys some comfort or confidence on perhaps being more aggressive on price. But it seems like recently the gap has narrowed. And as commodity inflation is going to ease as we move through the year, I'm just wondering, one, how you think about further price increases beyond the 3% in the U.S. today. And then just as a separate add-on to Pete's comments earlier, I know you said -- when you think about 2012, that you're investing for continued growth and how that's going to pressure the operating income, and you also kind of talked about being somewhat cautious on U.S. and European margins the next couple of quarters. So I was just hoping you could frame up the directional thought for 2012. I think you still sounded fairly confident that you can hit your 6% to 7% operating income. I guess, that's kind of your long-term. So I'm just wondering if you can give some directional color with all those pressures you alluded to and confidence still hitting that target.\nPeter J. Bensen: Sure. First, on the pricing in the U.S., Jeff. You kind of -- you hit on the head, as over the last several months, there's been a wider gap on the food-at-home being growing greater than the food-away-from-home. That gap is starting to narrow. And in fact, the outlook, food-away-from-home is still projected to grow at 2% to 3% this year. But food-away-from-home is now projected to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. That's down a little bit from the last projection. So that gap is narrowing. And as you think traditionally about our parameters, that 2% to 3% for food-away-from-home, absent any significant gap with the food-at-home, is probably a good way to think about our pricing for the year. So that 2% to 3% is probably the constraints for that one.\nDonald Thompson: Jeff, the other part of this one, too, is we -- and Pete mentioned this. We really look at food-away-from-home as our primary metric relative to how we establish our strategic pricing. We look at food-at-home, it's kind of -- because we can't price the food-at-home because it's too much more -- it's too volatile. It swings up and down so much more aggressively. So we look at food-away-from-home primarily. But what food-at-home tells us is whether or not we may be seeing additional pressures relative to, say, a breakfast daypart. And so that allows us to adjust some of our marketing and our value messaging appropriately.\nPeter J. Bensen: Regarding the conversation on the longer-term targets, Jeff, very comfortable in the 6% to -- our long-term target, 6% to 7%, obviously the last few years, we've been significantly ahead of that. But as we outlined in November, with some of the actions we're taking to invest and some of these near-term headwinds around commodities, we're probably closer to that 6% to 7% this year than we've been the last few years, and specifically, these next couple of quarters. So in the U.S., I mentioned commodities will be up another close to 7% again in the second quarter, and we won't have the benefit of leap year and the favorable weather. So again, margins look pretty similar in the second quarter for the U.S. I mentioned the G&A. We haven't come off our 6% forecast for the year. But with the timing of some of these events, our internal plans are at double-digit G&A growth for the next couple of quarters. So as we look throughout the year, again, we're very confident in our ability to hit that long-term target. But there's going to be -- the next couple of quarters may look a little down off of that relative to some of these items that I mentioned.\nKathy Martin: And our next question is from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.\nJohn S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to maybe just go back to the U.S. and talk about the new Extra Value Menu and what your intentions are here. I know you've made some changes to the Dollar Menu as well. So is the intention here to maybe migrate people off the Dollar Menu as a basis for just the meal and try to get more traction with sort of a value but at a higher price point? Maybe you can talk about if this menu has any implications from a margin standpoint. And then, Pete, just I wanted to clarify your comments about the operating income growth, 6% to 7%. That's constant currencies, correct? So as we look at next couple of quarters, with currency pressure magnifying, it's probably on a reported basis probably even less than that.\nPeter J. Bensen: Correct, John. I'll clarify the operating income comments, and then Don can talk about the Extra Value Menu. But you're right. That long-term guidance is in constant currency. And with the $0.05 to $0.07 each of the next couple quarters of pressure, obviously the reported number will be less than that.\nDonald Thompson: And, John, relative to the new Extra Value Menu, it fits within an overall price value strategy that we continue to move forward. As we look at commodity pressures clearly, we understand that there are certain aspects of the Dollar Menu that are tougher relative to cash flow and margin accretion. So what we've looked to do with the new Extra Value Menu is to have some opportunity to bring some products down to a lower level price, i.e. the 20-piece McNugget, which are really compelling and shareable offer to customers. But at the same time, we also know that this will highlight and emphasize products like the Snack Wraps, which are accretive to building the margin. So it's a combination of both longer-term, we know that we want to keep the Dollar Menu intact. However, you may see some changes within the menu and some of those products may change just a little bit. We'll rotate some new ones in possibly and some may rotate out. But we're going to make sure we continue to have great value for customers across-the-board, but you may see some changes in terms of the overall value menu strategies.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.\nMatthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Congratulations again, Jim, on a great tenure. Just transitioning, I guess, to go a little bit further into Europe there. I guess, 2 of the countries -- you talked about France actually in this sales -- in this monthly sales release as being one of the stronger regions. And then also looking at France and Portugal, sort of those 2 countries that have seen the VAT increase, I guess, for restaurants as it's been reported this year, would you -- could you give us some color on as far as, what have you seen in trends early on in the year? Has the consumer reverted a little bit home with their food dollar? Or are you sort of having somewhat of a countercyclical benefit? And are people, for lack of a better term, I guess, trading down to better value and coming into your restaurant, that maybe in the past wouldn't have, given the, I guess, it's about a 150 bps jump on the VAT in France?\nDonald Thompson: Matt, I would say, first of all, relative to France, I wouldn't say that France is one of the stronger performing areas today. I think they're going through some serious consumer confidence issues, and we're also seeing a lessened discretionary spending. There's some concerns in the marketplace relative to austerity measures. Having said that, we continue to perform and continue to grow market share. And that's the point. And when the IEO is contracting or slowing down, our focus becomes how we can continue to grow market share and maintain a larger base of customers. And so we're going to continue to do that in France. Portugal is a very interesting area relative to the 10% VAT increase they had there, going from 13 to 23 percentile. We have done a lot of work with our franchisees there to make sure that we maintain a great price value component in the overall strategy. Now what that means in the short term is that in a small market like Portugal, we may have some decreased margins. But in the longer-term, we'll secure the customer base and we'll build the business as we move forward, so -- but things like that are happening, whether it be Portugal. It's happened in Hungary, Romania before. But these are smaller markets.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham. Okay. We're going to move on then. Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jim, I want to echo all the positive comments and wish you good luck. Question on the noon to 1 p.m. throughput comments and putting more labor into the stores. Can you talk about if it's simply that or if there are other measures improving that throughput? And probably the same question, talk about some of the technology investments that you referred to. Is some of that directed at labor productivity and throughput?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes, it absolutely is, Joe. So there's a couple of things that are impacting that. One is a focus on what we call scheduling, staffing and positioning. So how many people do we have on the floor during those peak hours and where are they positioned is very important to driving more transactions through the restaurant during those peak hours. So do we have all of our kitchen equipment fully utilized? So both sides of our sandwich preparation table, for example. But also, the new register system, the new point-of-sale system, as you point out, is also an enabler because we're able to take orders more quickly and more accurately, so we get the customer through the restaurant. But that new POS also enables things like the handheld order taker and the side-by-side drive-thru, which again gets more orders back into that kitchen during these peak hours, which is another way to expand our capacity. But those -- the new POS had already been in the U.S. last year, and so there was no incremental cost relative to that in this quarter. But certainly, with adding some additional labor under the staffing guidelines, that's where we start to see a little impact on the labor line. Net-net, to grow, I think we grew comp transactions 5% during that lunch hour in the first quarter. And that was a significantly greater growth relative to that hour in the prior year. So those investments are definitely paying off for us.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.\nSara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So I did want to ask about Europe, and 2 follow-ups, if I may. One is Europe. And that is, can you kind of parallel what you see in Europe now that maybe what you saw in the U.S. in 2009? Because I feel like, in many ways, we talked about the same -- not a lot of tolerance for rising prices and sort of it took a little while, but eventually, the cumulative effects of what we saw in the U.S. in '08 kind of hit home in '09. So is that sort of what we should anticipate for the year ahead in France and Germany, may play out like we saw in the U.S. in '09? And then on China, can you just talk briefly, you had -- breakfast grew 20% overall comps rate in the half. Can you just tell us how much price you had on there and whether you saw relative softness in either of the other dayparts?\nDonald Thompson: Sarah, this is Don. A couple of things. I think a very astute comment relative to Europe or France today versus the U.S. a couple of years ago. And actually, I'd even go back to the 2008 time frame, 2008, 2009. They are quite similar in that what we did then was we put much more emphasis on our value messaging from a marketing perspective. We made the value offerings more prominent in the restaurant, and that definitely helped us secure what I will call those customers who had decreased discretionary dollars, and they continued to come into McDonald's. And in Europe, across-the-board, we're doing the same thing now. We've been doing it with the Eurosaver Menu in markets like the U.K. We're doing it with SMS in Germany. We're doing it with P'tits Plaisirs in France. I do believe that what we're facing in France now, because we've had -- we haven't had the same strong competitive set in France, we've not had to go there as aggressively, but now we're at a point where from a consumer confident perspective, we are going there a lot stronger relative to that marketing power. So I think it's a very, very good comment. They are somewhat similar. The difference, though, I would say in Europe, Europe, we have a foundation, particularly in markets like France, of having the restaurants reimaged. And so that definitely helps us and allows us also to continue to sell some more premium-based products. Relative to China, in terms of pricing, that's something that normally we don't disclose, but I think this -- in this case is important. China, we did a price increase of 5 percentile. And we know that, that is going to help us relative to moving forward to be able to help us with margin and also help us face some of the commodity-based pressures that we see there.\nPeter J. Bensen: But with the -- your specific question, Sara, about the breakfast. Breakfast is less than 20 -- is less than 10% of the business there. So while the comps were really strong, and obviously were strong at lunch, where we saw a little lesser momentum was in our dessert kiosks and a little bit more of the discretionary visit potentially, so the snacking kind of visit. But again, the balance of where the business is coming from in China is still pretty good. And it's coming from where we're really focusing a lot of our attention, so that's good. And just to clarify that 5% number that Don gave, that's our trailing 12-month impact of the price increases. We didn't take all of that in this first quarter.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe just a follow up on the U.S. I mean, you've talked about pricing. But I mean, what do you think about, I guess, a couple of things? Kind of excluding the benefit from remodels or reimages, if it's possible to do that, what kind of an industry traffic growth environment do you think we are in the U.S., in other words, as you kind of slowly improving employment and, I guess, consumer confidence offsetting higher gas prices to where we kind of are in a tailwind environment as opposed to a headwind environment? And secondly, when we think about the overall menu, obviously some changes to value and how you're positioning things and the potential introduction of premium-priced, limited-time-only products, are we kind of in your positive mix environment, perhaps at least in '12 or, I mean, perhaps even in the next couple of years? So just trying to get you to kind of think about price mix and traffic in the U.S. and what kind of environment that we have, helping you or hurting you.\nJames A. Skinner: Yes, John. Jim Skinner. Just make a couple of comments on that. First of all, the employment environment, based on yesterday's number, is actually getting a little worse instead of getting a little bit better in terms of jobless claims. And it's been fairly flat. We're at that 8% unemployment or better -- or worse, I should say, 8.3%, whatever that number is. And the consumer confidence has gone up some, but I think that's just because people are sort of worn-out over the overall economic issues and how it's impacting them personally. And so they're just in a place of normalcy now relative to this entire issue on the economy and savings and eating at home and eating away from home. And that environment, as you know, has continued to operate about the same as it has been. And so our philosophy around pricing and menu and Dollar Menu and all of those things that Don talked about earlier has remained the same. We really haven't changed our strategy around that. We always have to have everyday affordability, the best in the business, at McDonald's. That's been our mantra really since 2002 and the advent of the Dollar Menu. And then obviously, the introduction of new menu items and snack items and what we call that fourth-tier area. So there's really not been a change regarding that. And the traffic has continued to be fairly robust in the U.S. around that for our restaurants. And we continued, as you know, to take share in the U.S. against the competitive set.\nPeter J. Bensen: The update we got just yesterday, John, from our folks in the U.S. actually shows the -- actually a slight drop in the forecast for the year for the traffic for the industry. It's projected to grow less than 1%. And so that makes our traffic growth even that much more remarkable in that environment. As it's starting to level off or decline a little bit, we continue to see significant traffic gains in the U.S.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Keith Siegner from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a question for either Pete or Don, just kind of an update on the reimaging program. I mean, we've had some -- I ask because you've got a couple large competitors announce big programs. It's been at least a year now since we had a real good update down in Tampa. And we know you're never complacent. So have you made any changes to the prototype? Is the cost of the remodel looking any different? Are the sales lifts looking any different? Just some general updates on that program, because clearly it's very impactful and an important part of the outlook, would be great.\nDonald Thompson: Keith, first of all, the reimaging efforts are going quite well. And I'll speak specifically about the U.S. I think your question was more focused on the U.S. We have upgraded the course. And I think that, that was something that we did early -- about the middle of the year last year. And we've got tremendous acceleration. In the latter part of the year, we reimaged quite a few, the predominance of our restaurants. We're on track this year to continue to exceed the numbers that we have out there right now. We think we're in that range of around 800 in terms of reimages in the U.S. And we feel very comfortable and confident in that number. What I've seen is that the sales, and the group reported to Pete and I and Jim earlier this week, the sales continue to be in the range, toward the high end of the range relative to what we told you guys about in that 6 percentile range relative to reimages. And the system itself is quite excited about it. I think we're going to continue to see aggressiveness in the reimages, relative to the competitive set. We hear a lot of information from time to time about others that are reimaging. I think the point for us is we have a proven track record of what reimaging can do, how to do it, how to maximize the opportunity and the sales from it, and also how to make sure that we get the cost in the right line. And so we're going to continue to do that, not only in the U.S., but as we complete the interiors in Europe and move further along with the exteriors and also as we move across APMEA and Latin America.\nPeter J. Bensen: And one encouraging thing to add onto that, Keith, is now that we've got a history of stores that have more than 12 months of operation since reimaging, we're actually seeing higher sales increases as they cross that anniversary. And so they're actually closer to that 7% in our 6% to 7% range in their 13th, 14th, 15th month, which is again very encouraging and supportive of our belief that this is a great long-term investment.\nKathy Martin: Okay. Our next question is from Steve Marrs, CitizensTrust.\nSteve Marrs - Citizens Business Bank: In your press release, you talked about APMEA growing first quarter sales by an increase of 5.5%. Also in your remarks, you talked about Japan being soft. Now here is my question. If you x out Japan, what would have APMEA been for the quarter, please?\nPeter J. Bensen: Steve, we don't have that number at our fingertips. So maybe offline, the Investor Relations folks could give you that. But obviously, we talked about China. We talked about Australia. A lot of the other markets across APMEA are performing extremely well on the top line.\nDonald Thompson: And at over 3,000 restaurants, the number would be much higher. But with us, again, that's not one that we kind of pull out when we factor sales.\nKathy Martin: Okay. We have time for one last question, Howard Penney from Hedgeye.\nHoward W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC: And I guess it's appropriate to ask Don about, the legacy of Jim Skinner has obviously been well-documented. He took over McDonald's after a difficult year. It was his job to keep the Plan to Win moving along and take McDonald's to the next level with beverages. And I understand you played a big part in that as well. As we look out over the next couple of years, what do you think your legacy will be when we're talking about your retirement? I know that's a little early, but if we could talk about your legacy and where you're seeing McDonald's is and maybe how do you think you'll take McDonald's to the next level, especially when we talk about the competition maybe reorganizing a little bit.\nDonald Thompson: Howard, first of all, I hope that retirement point is quite a few years down the road. Otherwise, that might mean it was induced by something other than me. Here's a point, I think. Jim has always been very strong in telling all of us and continuing to drive the point of what we have to do is focus on the basics. I've been around McDonald's for over 20 years now, and I think what's most important for everyone is to understand that a change in leadership doesn't mean a change in strategy. I was here on the front end when we did the Plan to Win, and I understand what it means to our organization in terms of alignment. We remain focused on those things we've talked about: people, product, place, price, promotion. One of the things that we've done over the last couple of years, and Jim has been great about allowing myself and Pete and the rest of the team to really kind of take the mantle and lead some of the strategies that we have set forth. When we talk about modernizing the customer experience, technology will play a major role in that. But even more so will be the new look of McDonald's and what that allows us to do with our menu set. When we talk about optimizing the menu, we will be more focused, as we have been, on nutritional-based products, but also on focusing on our core and some premium products that we see coming out of areas like Europe. One of the things that we have that's a big potential, we can scale products and learn from the various areas of the world, and we will do that at a more accelerated pace. Lastly, I would say that when we talk about the broadening accessibility, we are much smarter now. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can deliver organic growth and we can build new restaurants. We know we can. We're doing it across APMEA and across many of our major markets. So we'll continue to do that. I don't worry about the legacy that will be left, and I'm not trying to chase the tremendous things that Jim has led us to do. I think myself and this team are focused on continuing to drive sustainable growth at McDonald's. And that is the key, Howard. And I think if we can continue to focus on the basics of this business; execution in the restaurants every day; the moment of truth, as Jim has called it, at that front counter; focused on the fact that we do have the power and the financial strength to grow both in development and organically, those are the things that I want to make sure we do. So I'm not really focused on the legacy aspect as much as I am continuing to see all of us move the business and grow as a global company.\nKathy Martin: Okay. We are done with our Q&A. And so I'm going to turn it over to Don for a few closing comments.\nDonald Thompson: Thanks to all of you. And I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I just want to reiterate our confidence in the continued strength of our business around the world. We're delivering solid results because the entire McDonald's system remains aligned behind executing our Plan to Win, and we're focused on driving toward our mission to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink. We'll continue to focus on being smart and strategic in this current environment while always striving to deliver the best customer experience as we know we can and have in each of our more than 33,000 restaurants around the world. So thanks again, and have a great day.\nKathy Martin: Thank you."}], "2014": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2013, "date": "2014-01-23 13:32:04", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin - Vice President, Investor Relations Don Thompson - President and Chief Executive Officer Pete Bensen - Chief Financial Officer Tim Fenton - Chief Operating Officer \nAnalysts:  Brian Bittner \u2013 Oppenheimer Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research John Glass - Morgan Stanley Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch David Tarantino - Baird David Palmer - RBC Capital Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital Howard Penney - Hedgeye Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein Alex Chan \u2013 Jefferies Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens  \nOperator: Hello and welcome to McDonald\u2019s January 23, 2014 Investor Conference Call.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin. \nKathy Martin: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen; and Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton who is joining us for Q&A. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.

Both documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don. \nDon Thompson: Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone. As we embark on a New Year, our systems focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver great tasting and high-quality food and beverages at the speed and at the convenience that only McDonald\u2019s can provide. We have high expectations for ourselves and we have added high expectations for our brand. And we will not waver in our commitment to delivering an exceptional experience for the 70 million customers who visit us every day. Given the challenging year that we had in 2013, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to adapting to keep pace with changing markets. We remain committed to investing to meet future demand. And we remain committed to addressing performance opportunities in the current environment. As we shared at the November Investor Meeting, our primary focus is on resetting and strengthening the relationship that we have with our customers. They are the driving force behind our mission and we continue to place them front and center in all that we do. We continue to execute against our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and to broaden accessibility, because these are the areas where we have the most significant opportunities to differentiate our sales. Our near-term opportunities revolve around optimizing current initiatives for greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach and better restaurant execution. In addition, we prioritized our near-term efforts on improvements in key opportunity markets. These include Germany and Japan, which are experiencing sustained negative trends and the U.S. and Australia which are significant contributors to consolidate a performance. Specifically, the leadership teams in these markets are developing more locally relevant solutions based on stronger consumer insights and more recent market learning\u2019s. This would help us to make the appropriate adjustments to regain momentum as we more clearly align with our customer\u2019s needs. Now, let\u2019s turn to 2013 global results. In constant currencies, operating income was up 1% for the quarter and 3% for the year. Earnings per share growth increased 2% for the quarter and was up 4% for the full year in constant currencies. For the full year global systemized sales grew 3% in constant currencies and global comparable sales grew up 20 basis points. Comparable sales were down 10 basis points for the quarter. Guest tracking was down across major segments reflecting initiatives that didn\u2019t resonate as strongly with consumers amid a sluggish IEO industry. 2013 was a difficult year and we\u2019re keenly aware of our short term challenges. Due to economic predictions are mixed but most assumed some limited global improvement in 2014. However we don\u2019t expect significant changes in market dynamics given modest growth projects for the IEO industry. Looking to January global comparable sales are expected to be relatively flat. Now let\u2019s shift to the markets, U.S. comparable sales decreased 140 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the entire year. Operating income was up 1% for both periods. Our U.S. 2013 results fell short of our expectations. We introduced a number of significant new products and limited time offers at a quick pace to challenge more effective restaurant and marketing execution. Our 2014 menu and marketing strategies better balance affordability with core products, new choices and limited time offers. For example the recent evolution to Dollar Menu and More intended to drive customer visits by offering greater value and variety while improving restaurant profitability and in today results are in line with initial expectations. We have also adjusted the sequencing of product introductions making it easier for restaurant teams to execute especially when it comes to training and staffing. So customers can truly enjoy an even better experience. Now these adjustments are complimented by a consistent focus on core equities like breakfast where a unique competitive advantage exist for McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019re enhancing the breakfast experience by creating more of a coffee culture through high quality McCafe products they pair very well with delicious foods both existing and new. And additional change is underway focusing in our brand strategies as we work to better resonate with our customers. In constant with other changes that we have made in the marketing organization yesterday we announced that Deborah Wahl will be joining our U.S. business as Chief Marketing Officer. We look forward to the fresh perspective that Deborah will bring as she leads the team as we refine our marketing strategies and our execution plans. Now let\u2019s move to Europe where comparable sales were up 1% for the quarter and flat for the year. In constant currencies operating income was flat for the quarter and up 4% for the year. Despite persistently low consumer confidence across the zone the UK, Russia and France generated positive comparable sales for the quarter partially offset by negative comparable sales in Germany and Southern Europe. The UK and Russia continued to grow promotions like Russia\u2019s American Classics generated excitement and the introduction of appealing menu platforms including blended ice in the UK created additional reasons for our customers to visit McDonald\u2019s. The UK also remains committed to daypart expansion. Efforts centered on extended hours, breakfast and the family business are driving momentum throughout the day. In France December marked five consecutive months of positive comparable sales. Strong promotional activity and an ongoing emphasis on relevant value offers like Casse Croute help fuel our momentum. Given uncertainty around consumer reaction to recent VAT increases and current economic indicators that do not reflect improvements in market dynamics. We remain cautiously optimistic about France. Let\u2019s turn to Germany where we see significant opportunities for improvement with new Company leadership in place and fresh perspectives among our franchisee leadership team. The markets goal is to stabilize this trend and begin rebuilding brand relevance. Driven by deeper insights we\u2019re refining our plans to focus on fewer yet better tactics than more closely aligned with local customer needs. For example October\u2019s launch of the McBaguette, a two item value bundle that mirrors the very successful cash Casse Croute in France. However with a German influence exceeded expectations because it's a high quality product at a price point where we previously had a gap to consumer expectation. Let\u2019s now shift to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, where comparable sales were down 2.4% for the quarter and down 1.9% for the full year. In constant currencies, operating income was relatively flat for both the fourth quarter and the year. Japan comprises roughly a third of APMEA\u2019s comparable sales though the market contributed less than 15% to the segment\u2019s operating income. Amid a highly competitive environment, Japan continued to experience significant comparable sales in guest count declines. Along with new leadership in this market, Japan is taking the steps necessary to strengthen the McDonald\u2019s brand connection with consumers. This includes repositioning its affordability strategy in concept with additional emphasis on hospitality and more relevant menu news for both the new and core foods and beverages. In Australia, comparable sales were relatively flat for the quarter. The appeal of new McWraps and Salads did help to build average check. Looking ahead, the market plans \u2013 the market plans are anchored around being even more relevant with local consumers. We are emphasizing value across all price tiers and we are launching more premium products to create excitement across the menu. In China, comparable sales decreased 40 basis points for the quarter, a sequential improvement over the last nine months and were down 3.6% for the full year. Our enhanced all day value platform is generating improvement and will continue to expand convenience initiatives, including dessert kiosk and delivery. And we will work to grow the family business across the market. Given the opportunities inherent in a growing more prosperous middle class, we also continue to grow through expansion in China. We opened 275 restaurants last year. Around the world, our holistic approach, which begins with the customer experience, is guiding our actions. And as our business continues to generate significant levels of cash, our first priority is making disciplined investments in the opportunities that will grow the business over the long-term. In 2013, we opened more than 1400 new restaurants and reinvested in our base of existing restaurants, including our re-imaging efforts. After capital expenditures, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long-term to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Last September, our Board of Directors announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, we returned a total of $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in 2014, we expect to return approximately $5 billion. In closing, I remain confident in McDonald\u2019s future and more specifically our ability to strengthen our relationships with our customers. My confidence is grounded in the fact that we are targeting the opportunities that exist within our three global growth priorities to optimize the menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s. Our plans are supported by a comprehensive execution approach, which leverages all three legs of the system to satisfy customer expectations and drive improved business performance. The alignment of franchisee, supplier partners and employees is strong and critical to our success and our strong local market structures enable us to more deeply understand and better execute those initiatives, which are most important to our customers in their local markets. These distinct competitive advantages are the reason we are well positioned to deliver enduring profitable growth today and for the long-term. Thanks again everyone and I will now turn it over to Pete. \nPete Bensen: Thanks Don and hello everyone. Though McDonald\u2019s grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share in 2013, our financial performance did not meet our high expectations. However, I am confident in the underlying strength of our system, our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong performance over the long-term. We entered the year with a renewed energy around engaging more deeply with our customers. We placed the customer at the center of everything we do and we have the resources and infrastructure to meet our goal of becoming our customer\u2019s favorite place and way to eat and drink. So how will we do this and what will be different in 2014? We are leveraging consumer insights to better understand how we can deliver on evolving consumer needs. This includes enhancing our value based messaging and reengaging with customers in more compelling ways from our marketing and promotions to the order points that are restaurants. We have identified areas where we can improve and are prioritizing the initiatives that are most impactful to our customers and we continue to move forward with investments that will drive long term growth than returns. Turning to 2013 performance, so revenues grew modestly at 2%, we prudently managed our expenses and maintained full year combined operating margin of 31.2%. Our operating margin continues to compare quite favorably to other large global consumer companies and restaurant businesses. Our profitability is driven by restaurant margins. Franchising remains core to our business model with 81% of our global restaurant operated by local business men and women. Franchise margins account for about 70% of total restaurant margins. In constant currencies, consolidated franchise margins increased 2% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and 3% to $7.6 billion for the full year. Our franchise business model is resilient ultimately dependent upon topline growth to maintain or expand margins over time. As a result of relatively flat comparable sales and higher occupancy cost the consolidated franchise margin percent declined 90 basis points for the quarter to 82% and declined 60 basis points for the full year to 82.4%. Consolidated company operating margins declined 60 basis points to 17.2% for the quarter and fell 70 basis points to 17.5% for the year. Higher operating cost in both periods amid weak comparable sales contributed to the margin declines. We\u2019re diligently managing restaurant expenses but we expect cost increases to continue pressuring margins in 2014. Looking at segment performance in the U.S. negative comparable sales in fourth quarter combined with 2% higher commodity cost and increased labor costs resulted in a 50 basis point decline in company operated margins to 19%. For the full year margins declined 110 basis points to 18.4% primarily due to higher labor, commodity and other expenses coupled with weak comparable sales. From a pricing standpoint we ended the year with a 3.1% increase in the U.S. This is a result of several smaller menu board increases taken through 2013 and an effective 50 basis point increase in November due to the introduction of the Dollar Menu and More. The food away from home inflation index ended the year up 2.1% which was at the low end of the expected 2% to 3% range. For comparison the food at home inflation index was significantly lower at 0.4% well below the expected range of 1% to 2%. Overtime we seek to price in-line with food away from home. As we look to 2014 both food away from home and food at home inflation is currently projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% although updated forecast are due in the coming days. We will continue to monitor these two indices closely. Balancing our desire to drive traffic to our restaurants with strategically managing margins and cash flow. On the expense side we expect 2014 U.S. commodity cost increases of 1% to 2% with more pressure in the first half of the year. Turning to Europe, in fourth quarter this segment increased company operated margins 30 basis points to 19.4% as positive comparable sales performance offset 1% higher commodity cost and increased occupancy expenses. For the full year margins increased 10 basis points to 19.2%. Europe\u2019s company operated margins benefited from strong performance in France as well as Russia and the UK. Combined these markets contribute over 60% of Europe\u2019s company operated margin dollars. At year-end Europe\u2019s price increase excluding Russia was about 1.5%. We remain very deliberate with our pricing given cautious consumer sentiment, VAT increases in markets like France and ongoing austerity measures, all of which pressure disposable income. Europe\u2019s 2014 commodity costs are also expected to increase about 1% to 2% with more pressure in the second half of the year. In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales in both fourth quarter and the full year with Japan having the most significant impact. Though the challenges differ across markets, we believe that emphasizing McDonald\u2019s key advantages of value, convenience and service will be critical to long-term growth in this segment. We tailor these advantages in different ways within each local market from providing affordable entry points through dessert kiosks in China, to enhancing everyday value platforms in China and Australia, to expanding our web ordering and delivery service in Japan. Markets across APMEA have some of our best customer service scores and we are encouraged by our continued progress. Quite simply, we want more customers to visit McDonald\u2019s more often. We will continue to innovate and invest across the diversified portfolio of markets within this promising area of the world. Relative to profitability, APMEA\u2019s company-operated margins declined 180 basis points for the quarter to 12.6% and declined 170 basis points to 14.2% for the full year as higher labor, occupancy and other costs pressured margins. New store openings in China continued to negatively impact APMEA\u2019s margins in both periods as well. Consolidated G&A was flat in fourth quarter and down about 3% for the full year in constant currencies. The full year decrease was driven primarily by lower incentive-based compensation. As discussed at the November Investor Meeting, we expect 2014 G&A to increase above $200 million or 8% in constant currencies reflecting the impact of below target 2013 incentive pay, expenses associated with our worldwide Owner Operator Convention in April and sponsorship of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in Sochi and cost to support restaurant growth, capacity enhancements and digital initiatives. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate guidance is 31% to 33%, although we do expect volatility between quarters given our global business. As a reminder, first quarter 2013 results reflected a one-time tax benefit of nearly $50 million related to the retroactive impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This contributed $0.05 to EPS in first quarter last year, which we will be lapping this quarter. McDonald\u2019s resilient business model continues to generate significant cash from operations. As Don mentioned, our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business. We are the global market leader and we intend to continue leveraging this competitive advantage. We will accomplish this through a balanced measured approach to investing in new and existing restaurants to drive future growth than returns. Looking to 2014, over half of our $2.9 billion to $3 billion of capital expenditures will be used to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants. We will grow to the opportunity in both established and emerging markets further enhancing our diversified portfolio. The breakdown for openings in our geographic segments is as follows: 250 in the U.S., 320 in Europe and 830 in APMEA, including about 300 new restaurants in China. We also continue to modernize our brand through re-imaging. We updated 1,529 locations in 2013, a little shy of our projection of over 1,600. This shortfall was spread fairly evenly across the segments. As we continued \u2013 as we make continued progress and some markets reach completion, our passive re-imaging is naturally slowing. This is reflected in 2014 plans that call for over 1,000 total re-images. This reduction is also the result of planned kitchen investments in the U.S. that are being prioritized in 2014. These new high density kitchen prep tables are designed to deliver enhanced service capabilities and menu choice to our customers. Lastly let me touch on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.01 and the full year by $0.05. At current exchange rates we expect first quarter EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.02 to $0.03 with a full year negative impact of $0.05 to $0.06. As always take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout 2014. We begin 2014 energized by our opportunities yet mindful of the challenges in front of us. We\u2019re the global leader in a $1.2 trillion highly fragmented industry. We\u2019re one of the strongest brands in the world with significant competitive advantages. Together with our outstanding owner/operators and suppliers whom we believe are the best in the business. We proudly serve 70 million customers every day and we aligned to drive enduring profitable growth for the McDonald system and our shareholders in the years to come. Thanks now I will turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A session. \nKathy Martin: Thanks Pete. I\u2019m going to now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). Again we will try to give as many people possible the opportunity to ask questions. So if you can try to limit yourself to one we will get back to you for a follow-up as time allows. Our first question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. \nBrian Bittner \u2013 Oppenheimer: Kind of big picture thoughts question here. I just think about over a decade you know for the last decade up until 2012 you guys really average the same store sales increase around that 5% range and you know overtime and Don you\u2019re at the heart of this but you guys had such compelling bottoms up drivers in the business and just we\u2019re executing against much lower sales per unit than you set at today. But as you said year-to-date seems the bottoms of drivers have just faded a bit from what they used to drive and the bottom-line I guess comps have hit this sluggish cycle and the question here is there anything that you see from a new platform perspective or new business layer perspective that you can go after to get back to those mid-single digit comps across the system or do you really sit here and look at your businesses today and think about it much more is being relied on the macro and much less about specific things that you can do to drive it. \nDon Thompson: We really believe Brian the strategic areas that we need to focus on to grow this business into the future. Those are somewhat consistent and we still have opportunities and those being around our menu and the menu being relevant really enhancing the customer experience and you guys know quite a bit about the execution focus and getting back to a stronger customer relationship this year as well as accessibility and affordability. Those areas are the right strategies; this affordability aspect is a very, very key component of our growth as we move forward. So we think we\u2019re in the right area with those strategies. The key is going to really be to reestablished the trust of customers. When we look across the broader range that is one of the consistent things that we see and that means basic execution at a restaurant level market engagement at a much stronger level and also to make sure that our menu is relevant. There are some other aspects of that that we have talked about being digital engagement, we have really not played in that arena in a strong way and clearly you all know based upon them and some of our conversations that our intent is to be much stronger with regard to our digital outreach and digital engagement focus. So we\u2019re focused really, you mentioned macro-economics. We\u2019re focused on those things within our control to drive our performance. This is going to be a market share battle and a market share battle gain in order for us to move the business but we believe we have the right strategies and the right focus at local levels in the markets to achieve the goals that we have. One of the things we have all discussed is that we got to really get back to a much stronger focus on what we call 5P execution. When we talked about the plan of win, people, product, place, price, promotion. Those five areas we have got to make sure that we\u2019re maxing out our execution strategies for whatever initiative that we implement in any market around the world. That\u2019s going to help us create that relevance again with our customer. So those focal points along with the priority focused on the key markets that we know we have challenges in and an even stronger fashion which Tim and teams are doing. I believe will get us the growth that we need not only for the current year but as we move forward Brian. \nKathy Martin: All right our next question is from Matt DiFrisco, Buckingham Research. \nMatt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research: My question is with respect to margins. I think you alluded when you talked about APMEA specifically about China having a little bit of a drag obviously because it\u2019s a company-owned mix where it\u2019s a franchise mix, but I wonder if you could comment on China, the company-owned margins, is there de-leverage there as well, I would assume with the slower comp? And then if you could sort of tie that in also how we should think, Pete, of the direction of the comp, I am sorry, the margin in the U.S. when you rollout and we start to see the kitchen equipment being put in there? Absent a comp lift, would we be seeing also a margin benefit from that initiative of new equipment coming into the stores? \nPete Bensen: Alright, Matt, I will give it a shot. China as you mentioned, we saw both. Our comparable stores did have a decline in margin as well as the impact of the new restaurants coming online although that impact of the new restaurants was less than it was a year ago. And as I think the excess you listened or we are at our investor conference, you heard Dave Hoffmann talk about some of the initiatives they have underway with their go-to-market strategy to look at bringing cost out of that development, the new development there, which will further lessen the impact of the new openings on the margins going forward there. So that piece of it is moving in the right direction, but as you mentioned, China as well as all the markets around the world, margins are a top line game. And to the extent that we aren\u2019t driving the comp sales that we need there, the margins will continue to be a little bit pressured. In the U.S., specifically U.S. around the kitchen equipment, but more broadly, one of the positives, if you will, out of the fourth quarter was we saw some margin benefit from the dollar menu and more pricing aspect. So we did see a little bit of positive impact to the chef there. As we rolled this new kitchen equipment out, it\u2019s going to have a couple of different impacts. One obviously some of what we have talked a lot is design to improve our throughput, improve our order accuracy, offer more choice and variety to the consumer. So from that standpoint, obviously that\u2019s a \u2013 should be a positive for the business. It\u2019s on the negative side of that so to speak. It will be additional investment. It will have additional depreciation associated with that some additional training. So in and of itself it\u2019s not a one single piece that\u2019s going to make or break the margins next year. We will continue to see commodity pressure. We had about 14 states raise minimum wage here effective January 1 with others making noise about doing the same thing, commodities, healthcare costs. So costs will continue to be a challenge for us in 2014 as we think about the margins. \nOperator: And our next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley. \nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. And more broadly Don or Pete, we are in a tough operating environment than you have been in a while, your advantage versus the peers seems to have shrunk and these are all things we have known for a while, maybe sales get better because you continue to push out these initiatives, but it may also be that we are just in a lower sales environment. So if that is a backdrop, what are the other things that you consider in looking at how to enhance the performance. So for example, many of your peers over the last several years have gone through more significant refranchising rounds. Is there an opportunity there? We have talked in the past while looking at your balance sheet, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s something you are inclined to do, but maybe willingness to revisit that. Looking at even corporate cost cutting, are there opportunities there to create a leaner organization given this leaner \u2013 these leaner economic times or leaner performance times. Any thoughts there will be helpful? \nDon Thompson: Yes, John thanks much for the question. Let\u2019s go back to how we view and look at performance and some of the data and what we actually see. If we look in the U.S. particularly, one of the things that we see today is a bit of a bifurcation on a consumer base. So some of the fast casuals are performing a bit better and customers are skewing that way a little bit more as a result of a bit more discretionary income and that economic class of individuals. So we also know that those customers that tend to come to us are fairing quite as well in the current economy in the U.S. Having said that, what we have to do John in the near term is focus on the value base, focus on some of the things that we know are going to be critical in terms of the execution of our menu. I am going to ask Tim in a moment to kind of speak a little bit to the key markets, because I don\u2019t want to just pass over that too briefly. There are a lot of opportunities we feel we have in the key markets. So Tim will give an update there. Relative to looking at things like refranchising, opportunities. We\u2019re constantly looking at that John and yes we do have a longer term plan relative to where we refranchise and opportunities there along with optimizing the portfolio in our major markets. G&A wise we are continuously looking at that and clearly as a pay for performance culture we don\u2019t perform as Pete mentioned the incentive based compensation in that part of G&A comes down. There are other areas that we reduce G&A and it's because we\u2019re continuing to focus on some strategic changes to our structures and our efficiency and effectiveness. So we\u2019re going to continue to look at those areas but I will tell you we have to be customer relevant. The way to drive the business is going to be through the top line growth which means the execution in the restaurant it means the product focus that we have and it means the way that we\u2019re addressing customers and engaging them. So with that Tim if you wouldn\u2019t mind speak a little bit to some of the key markets that you see and opportunities. \nTim Fenton: Key markets that we\u2019re looking at, obviously the U.S., Germany, Japan and relatively new leadership in the U.S., Germany and Japan as well and each team is focused on making those adjustments necessary to regain the momentum. Specifically in the U.S., energizing consumer messaging and market execution. We stumbled a little bit last year with too many new products, too fast and create a lot of complexity. As we mentioned in November reestablishing our breakfast with a lot of emphasis on beverage and coffee. We know that coffee drives the visits at our breakfast time and I guess one of the biggest things that we\u2019re looking at and U.S. is focusing on peak hour execution. That goes hand in hand with the enhancements of our prep table. It gives us more capacity in those peak hours and of course menu choice. In Germany, we\u2019re going to focus on fewer but better tactics built around deeper insights behind what really addresses Germany\u2019s needs. We are responding to the caf\u00e9 and bakery, it really kind of impacted McDonald\u2019s affordability and relevance by introducing such products as the McBaguette fulfill that price point gap. And of course strengthening our value program and focus more on core and continuing to push breakfast even though it is a low base it is growing for us there. Japan taking steps that we frame what the brand represents to our customers and repositioning the markets affordability strategy. We can\u2019t go head to head with the 45000 convenient stores on price alone we realize that. So we really have to put emphasis on our hospitality a new menu news, both new and core. \nKathy Martin: All right our next question is from Joe Buckley, Merrill Lynch. \nJoe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I know you mentioned the Dollar Menu and More was meeting your internal expectation so far but could you talk about the extra-value menu experience in 2012 versus the early Dollar\u2019s are more experienced in the latter part of 2013 and how are they comparing contrast? Yeah I know you had to back away from the extra-value menu and just kind of curious the reaction to Dollar Menu and More why you\u2019re encouraged by it and what do you think that\u2019s staying power and can it kind of move the customer traffic needle as you suggest was the goal. \nTim Fenton: First of all if you look back at 2012 we had extra-value menu, we had extra-value meals plus we had Dollar Menu. Rather confusing not only to our customers but actually kind of confusing to us. With the Dollar Menu and More it's meeting our expectations during the test. It was designed to really stretch out our products of variety and give us flexibility in pricing. It's simpler, it's easier. It's only been in stores for a couple of months and the couple of months was through the holiday period. We\u2019re seeing slight gains in guest counts and of course as Pete mentioned earlier it's margin friendly. So far so far so good, and it was a good transition and evolution for where we had to go with our value menus and dollar menu. \nDon Thompson: Hey Joe if I might you know one thing and I have mentioned this in the comments to get back to a stronger relationship with customers. to be very honest extra-value menu while a very solid attempt was based in mining out additional profitability, the consumer part of that from a consumer benefit was not as strong as Dollar Menu and More. Dollar Menu and More is customer focused, customer based builds out to core equity and yields that value the customers in that way. Extra-value menu was really a reformulation of certain products adding some others just to build profitability. So this is what we mean by getting closer and getting back to a strong relationship with the customers. \nOperator: Alright. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. \nDavid Tarantino - Baird: Hi, good morning. Don and Pete, actually I have a follow-up to maybe that last comment where you talked a lot about using consumer insights to drive the business more so than you have done in the past? And I think Pete mentioned in his remarks that you have identified some areas where you need to improve? And I know you have alluded to a lot of it so far, but maybe it would be helpful if you could give some specific examples especially in the U.S., where it looks like the relative performance has been pretty soft in the recent months? What have you learned from consumers where McDonald\u2019s brand is currently missing the mark and maybe how does that translate to the tactics you are going to use going forward? \nPete Bensen: I will tell you what, David, what I would do is I talk to a part of this and I want Tim to talk a little bit to the operations piece of it, because that\u2019s a big part too. So again and I know it\u2019s going to sound like Don, you continue to mention the same thing, but I am going to go back to customer relevance. In the U.S., one of the challenges we have is we have lost some of our customer relevance and we have lost it across several parts of the day. So relative to the breakfast part which Tim just mentioned, this notion on coffee is not just about coffee, it\u2019s about our breakfast business. Coffee too is a big part of the lead for breakfast, but we have great tasting food. If we lose relevance in coffee, then we are going to lose the transaction which yields food purchase. And so we have got to make sure that the food is relevant and that the awareness around McDonald\u2019s as a kitchen and a restaurant that cooks and prepares fresh high-quality food is strong and pronounced in our marketing and our messaging. So we have got to get back to that on food. We have got to get back to an energy and excitement in our marketing balance in the execution of it. And that\u2019s something that all of us have noted, Jeff Stratton and the team in the U.S. have noted. And you have seen some of the changes, which again Tim can update you on relative to even personnel changes in the U.S. So that\u2019s one of the specifics in the U.S. that I could speak to. We talked about value, but Tim maybe on this operations front, because that\u2019s another big one. \nTim Fenton: One of the things we did last year David, we overcomplicated the restaurants. If you remember, we introduced McWraps, we introduced Egg White Delight, we introduced Quarter Pounder Toppers and really didn\u2019t give the restaurants an opportunity to breathe. We instituted a gatekeeper really with the intent of doing fewer products, but better execution. We mentioned a little bit earlier the capacity on the prep table that allows us really to have more capacity during our peak hours, where we haven\u2019t been able to particularly in some of our drive-through restaurants service quickly and fulfill the capacity that we wanted, so fewer products, better. One other thing and you talk about insights and I want to mention Jeremy, historically, we lost some share based on our insights to non-traditional competitors, caf\u00e9s and bakeries. At the same time, when we were pulling off some of our value offerings, bakery stepped up with value offerings and some of our trade went to non-traditional QSRs, as I said, bakeries and caf\u00e9s. We have learned about that. We are designing our strategy to how we can go back to mitigate that, but that\u2019s a deeper understanding of consumer insights market by market by market. \nOperator: Next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital. \nDavid Palmer - RBC Capital: Thanks. In the past, McDonald\u2019s would have operations upgrades like Made for You or the beverage station and that will allow your marketing machine to get cranking over several years oftentimes driving the sales layer. I am trying to figure out if some of these changes that you are doing with the prep tables could be an enabler from an innovation and marketing standpoint as well as something that helps you with peak hour capacity and execution. Could you comment on that please? \nTim Fenton: Yes. I will make one comment on the marketing piece and there is \u2013 again there is another capacity piece to this. On the marketing end, David, you are right, one of the things that we have done and actually we didn\u2019t do it nearly and strongly with Made for You back in 1998. We implemented Made for You, but we really didn\u2019t come out with a strong marketing campaign that was correlated to it. We have individual markets that didn\u2019t start to benefit, but we didn\u2019t hit it as strong. To that point, even today, customers don\u2019t realize to the greatest extent that at McDonald\u2019s we are making that sandwich, preparing that in the back of the house after you place that order. What does this mean? It means that there is a notion of that again that relationship and the awareness the customers have about who we really are as McDonald\u2019s and what we are able to deliver in that kitchen which is a customized sandwich for you. It's something that we really need to be able to advance in our marketing messages more now. Challenges has been there has been a little concern as to whether or not and how hard we can go with that messaging if we didn\u2019t think we had more capacity headroom. So with that in mind we have done some things with the kitchen and Tim maybe a little bit high density. \nTim Fenton: Yeah well the high density UHC cabinets we have allows us more capacity and the prep table enhancements not only gives us flexibility and customization with other toppings it gives us the capacity and some of the existing products that we had that we had not to get really operationally technically but we had a cross over and replenishing during peak hours was the last thing you want to do but with the refrigerated rail that we\u2019re adding and we should have this all into the system between the May - June timeframe. It is all just some flexibility with different variety of the toppings, jalapenos, avocado, (indiscernible) and different spice sauces if you will. There is a lot of flexibility and more customization. So it's capacity on existing, it gives us flexibility for new products and new toppings as we go forward. \nDon Thompson: And then we got to tie those together David to your point we have got to tie the marketing messages and awareness into driving this. That\u2019s one of things that you are referenced quite a bit when you talk about coffee. We referenced PR, marketing and the operational pieces together to drive that category and we will do it again. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo. \nJeff Farmer - Wells Fargo: Just following on the I don\u2019t know throughput side you\u2019ve discussed the high density, the prep tables, lot of other plans but are you guys planning to add labor to these restaurants? How should we think about that moving forward? \nTim Fenton: That\u2019s another priority that we have and in fact our (indiscernible) is right now working with all of our operators on just that. Staffing, positioning and scheduling as far as putting the right people on it at the right time particularly during our peak hours. We have to have the additional staffing required for some of the complexity that we have. That was I think one of the stumbling\u2019s we had last year with all the new products we brought in all at the same time or within close proximity. So definitely it is a priority for us and beefing up staff and particular on peak hours and weekends. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. \nJeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Just a question on kind of broader Europe and I think we have talked about this few quarters about but France seems to have joined the UK and Russia perhaps in recent months. I know Don you mentioned the string of positive comps there and that leaves I guess Germany as the weak major market. One, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s fair and two, I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about \u201914 whether or not Europe could be the silver linings for the broader company it does seem like at least on the macro data that we see that the trends are stabilizing or perhaps improving across broader Europe. I\u2019m wondering if that is the case where the brand McDonald is seeing that and if what would be a good way to play the improving European macro and if there is anything specific to talk about in Germany and I know you mentioned new leadership but anything else that we should expect to help send that comp to the positive side? \nDon Thompson: I think Tim mentioned some of the things that are taken place in Germany right now and I believe that, you know what\u2019s different about Germany aspect is that this we had a refocusing before. We put something\u2019s in place that were customer focus. We only executed them for shorter period of time and we pulled them out. I think that\u2019s been a lot of learning\u2019s relative to what we should do in Germany along with the fact that whenever you execute a \u201cbest practice\u201d it can\u2019t be adopted. It has to be adapted which is also the difference between McBaguette and Casse Croute. So relative to Germany that\u2019s one of the things that we knew we had to be able to do. France, I want to echo a comment I made around cautiously optimistic. I think our French team as are we; we have seen some a trend, a positive results. France is still an economy that\u2019s got some troubles to it. There is a VAT increase that I mentioned, we also have some, there is some decisions that will be made soon relative to the French government from a social charge and austerity based prospective. We will have to take a look at, we hope that it will stimulate the economy which will be good for everyone but right now France is still at a point where the 2014 IEO projection is to be down 10 basis points and so it is not a market that is come out yet but we have seen some positive things and in the face of all of those our teams have done a fabulous job. Southern Europe is an area that still has some challenges. And those are macroeconomic challenges. And we just got to make sure we maintained relevance in that area. So Europe as we always say, Europe is not a country. And so when you divide it across the various segments, we see some positive areas and then we see some areas that are still difficult. So we are optimistically looking at performance across Europe, but there are still some challenges there. \nPete Bensen: And just to add, Jeff, the IEO projections are really modest going forward, the UK plus 50 basis points and Germany plus 50 to 80 basis points. \nOperator: Alright. Our next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye. \nHoward Penney - Hedgeye: Hi, thanks very much. I have two questions for you if you don\u2019t mind. The first one is on the high-density tables and when I hear additional capacity or additional customization is the sense that occurs in the \u2013 I think slower service times more than I do faster service times and I apologize for this question, because I actually haven\u2019t those tables in news, so I don\u2019t really understand how they work. So, how does additional customization not equal slow at service times? And then two, can you may be provide a definition of what met internal expectations means, just because the use of the triple times relative to initiatives in 2014 that really haven\u2019t delivered whether it\u2019s reps or (indiscernible)? Well, they may have met internal expectations, they didn\u2019t really drive the business forward and they are also now using that term associated with the dollar, the new dollar menu and more? Thank you. \nDon Thompson: Hi Howard. I will take the piece on internal expectations and I\u2019ll let Tim to talk more about the high density kitchen and impact on operations. But when we say internal expectations, we have clearly a business case for each and every individual initiative that we implement. We have certain criteria that we establish whether that be based upon guest count growth, it might be sales growth, profitability aspects. So we look at those business cases and we have internal expectations set around certain targets. We also have expectations set around the overall accretive nature of an initiative to the broader business. And so when we look as we measure whether or not something was effective and whether or not we are successful we measured against those internal criteria. You guys typically hear us talk about the consolidation of all of the initiatives, which then roll up into an incremental benefit in a comp sales or something that might be associated with our operating income at a total level. \nTim Fenton: Howard, on the capacity, anytime during our peak hours, if I can keep people in place and not have their feet moving to restock or to get something else or have crossed over last year, we deleted angus it\u2019s a slow moving product for us. So we are working with two proteins and a beef in the kitchen. When I can have the capacity in the prep table, well people don\u2019t have to move, I am just putting different toppings on. You have got the protein coming down the prep table like an assembly line if you will and we are just adding different condiments on. And again, monitoring the pace and the rate of new products that we bring and giving our crews and management ample time to train and get used to before we switch it up and change it on. \nOperator: Alright. Our next question is Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. \nGreg Badishkanian - Citigroup: Across your biggest markets, have you noticed any change in the competitive environment over the let\u2019s say the last month or two that\u2019s kind of a deviation from the trend? \nDon Thompson: Well, in the U.S. last month in fourth quarter, we had I guess a higher competition as it pertains to value and discounts and so on. And I would say maybe a little bit more in China in the fourth quarter and maybe specifically in Australia, but it\u2019s a very competitive market out there, lot of price going on and it\u2019s a fight for market share. It\u2019s a street fight and we are getting at it. \nOperator: Next question comes from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein. \nSara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. I actually wanted to follow-up on margins, because the restaurants, company-operated restaurant margins look better broadly speaking than I would have expected given some of the sluggish top line and what you have said about your leverage point. So the two questions are can you just talk a little bit more about where there might be opportunities there on that line item. Going forward, you said costs are going to be a headwind, but just how well you can manage that line? And then related note, the outlook for food away from home and food at home inflation and positive fruition [ph] but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really seeing that in the commodity markets. Can you talk about what you think of as kind of your sweet spot translation where you have the ability to take price but it's not so much that it's a real drag on margins physically with U.S. and then broadly. Thanks. \nPete Bensen: In talking about margins the fourth quarter actually did exceed our own internal expectations when we started the quarter. So if you recall I gave some guidance that imply we expected margins to be down a little bit more in the fourth quarter than they really were and if you look as we look at the reasons for that it was really France and Russia outperformed in the fourth quarter relative to their initial expectations and actually Germany didn\u2019t decline as much as they had originally expected. So Europe was a big piece of that but also the U.S. as I alluded to earlier some of the check benefit that we got from the Dollar Menu and More in the two months it was in was to the positive side as a ledger and also their cost came in just slightly under where they had expected for the quarter. So it was a combination of factors in different markets that led to that. When we think about 2014, you know food away from home projection of 2.5% to 3.5% the reason I said in my remarks that we expect an update shortly is with the commodity trends and everything else that\u2019s going on. That number might come down a little bit. Now certainly it does also include labor in the restaurants and I mentioned minimum wage increases in 14 states is a piece of impacting that as well but right now we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that indices. We\u2019re also going to look at food at home again that only grew 40 basis points this year. I doubt it will grow 2.5% to 3.5% which is the current forecast based on where commodity trends are but at the end of the day we\u2019re going to look at the pricing as we always do to try to balance growing traffic in the restaurants but also looking at profitability all through that screen that Don mentioned of continuing to improve our relevance with our customers and value is also one area to where relevance to customers matters. \nKathy Martin: All right we\u2019re running a little low on time, we\u2019re getting close. So we\u2019re going to take a couple more. Next is Andy Barish from Jefferies. \nAlex Chan \u2013 Jefferies: This is Alex Chan for Andy. I wanted to go back to talking about APMEA. During 2012 it seemed like check was really down and traffic kind of held up and this past year in 2013 that kind of reversed I guess how do you find the balance there and when you look at that how do you think about China and kind of avoiding that same issue? \nDon Thompson: Well China specifically they got as an industry hit the QSR and ideal [ph] with the chicken situation that happened in December of 2012 and then the rehit of the Avian influenza and a downturn in just the macroeconomics. Something not unlike what we saw back in 2008 we bounced back in 2009 and 2010 and \u201911. So we in China specifically we stick to our strategy. We feel we have got a sound strategy; we\u2019re being strategic on our openings. We are being strategic on our menu pricing and our points of distribution.  \nKathy Martin: Okay. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. \nWill Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens: I had a follow-up question on margins at the restaurant level in particular. At the Analyst Day you talked about the three straight years of margin compression. So I wondered if you can speak more specifically to that path and margin stabilization. Could that occur this year and then maybe more specifics around what that expansion might look like and how that might take place from here? \nDon Thompson: As we looked at the margins over the last couple of years actually just recently looking at a kind of a detailed breakdown by quarter-by-quarter by the line items. One thing that was consistent across the years is that you know the cost pressures kind of in general were in a fairly tight range. It wasn\u2019t a huge spike one way or the other, absent commodities which could have more of a significant impact but they weren\u2019t a significant driver of the margin decline as much as the variation in the top line. And I know we sound a bit like a broken record, but the importance of driving comps in our business to margin profitability is so important and then getting back to that relationship with the customer, improving our relevance is going to lead to that improving top line, which then has that margin flow-through benefit and restaurant level cash flow growth, it\u2019s really the key to getting the economic engine moving in the right direction again. \nOperator: Alright. And this will be our last question, Keith (indiscernible) from UBS. \nUnidentified Analyst: Strengthening the brand to differentiate, it was one of the stated intense and another one was the primary focus of the cash flows is to reinvest in the business. I am just wondering given that strength in underlying cash flow generation in a balance sheet that, yes, I think it clearly provide incremental capital should you want to do, why not accelerate investments now both re-imaging and kitchen investments simultaneously. Is there an operational hurdle to doing so, because it seems like this is a major competitive advantage that McDonald\u2019s has, because in acceleration of this reinvestment in this environment be one of the ways to rekindle and reignite that relationship with the consumer? Thanks. \nDon Thompson: Hi, Keith. I am going to speak to (indiscernible) and I will ask Pete to speak to the other part. The notion of accelerating reinvestment, one of the things that we found across the business and history has dictated to us is that you have to have a balanced focus as we grow the business. So one of the reasons that you haven\u2019t seen us just say we are going to put all of our dollars right into China and let\u2019s just go hard, because we also have other emerging markets that we also want to grow and we want to grow consistently. By growing consistently, it allows us to build up the associated infrastructure from a supply chain perspective, the talent that we need to manage the market and build out the real estate development as well as our ability to be able to put dollars into market and create awareness within those markets to build comparable sales to be able to be a sustaining business model. And so as we look at some of the areas around our capital investment and deployment, we want to be balanced and measured. If it\u2019s something like a kitchen based reinvestment, there is a pace that you can\u2019t go at in the restaurant and at the same time make sure that you are maintaining the penultimate focus, which is to focus on customer satisfaction and expectations. If we change all of the market at one time and went out and got a bunch of general contractors, what we would find is that we would lessen our ability to satisfy customers and we wouldn\u2019t spread out these activities and execute and affect the plan. So this is one of the reasons you guys talk about we will have a moderate and a steady pace, but on a base as large as ours, our steady pace is pretty aggressive for other people. And so this is the reason we say that. There are some other implications than Pete to probably talk about a couple of those from a financial perspective. \nPete Bensen: Yes, Keith. I mean, it is much less about the capital, because as you know, we have the ability to throw more at it, but you alluded to operational, it is sequencing and getting these things done in a way, it takes a lot of planning and resources both internal and external contractors to change out the kitchen equipment in 14,000 restaurants around the U.S. So all of the time and energy you need to focus on that to the extent you also try to focus on accelerating re-imaging and a lot of the same kind of contractors or internal people, are needed for both types of projects, you do start to dilute the effect and not get the desired outcome. In addition, we have over 2,000 franchisees in the U.S. So this has to also be done through them considering their individual capacity, their individual cash flows their individual organization strengths. So while I agree with you on paper, it sounds like going faster could be a quicker path to getting some of these relevancy issues dealt with that Don mentioned. The reality and practical nature of a large franchise system with somewhat limited resources in terms of the competencies to work on these kind of projects gets us to kind of the pace that we are adding. And to Don\u2019s point, I think it is a fairly aggressive pace in and of itself. \nOperator: Alright. We will close out with some final thoughts from Don. \nDon Thompson: So once again, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate that and we appreciate your interest in McDonald\u2019s. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages of our systems are truly a reflection of our ability to learn from our past, to be quite purposeful and agile in the present conditions and environments that we operate in and strategically plan and evolve with our customers as we look to the future. As we mentioned from the onset we are confident in the McDonald\u2019s business and we\u2019re confident that we have the right information, data and business acumen to address the key markets and the other opportunities that we have going forward. So thank you all once again and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-10-21 13:52:06", "content": "Executives: Don Thompson - President and CEO Peter Bensen - EVP and CFO Kathy Martin - VP, IR\nAnalysts: Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Glass - Morgan Stanley Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital David Tarantino - Robert W.

Hottovy - Morningstar Andy Barish - Jefferies Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research Hello and welcome to McDonald\u2019s October 21, 2013 investor conference call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, vice president of investor relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Thank you, and hello, everybody. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via the phone, webcast, and podcast. And before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available at our website www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Good morning everyone, and thank you, Kathy. In July, we talked about three lenses through which we\u2019re framing our performance. We talked about the past, the present, and the future. Today, I want to talk about the present and the future. We\u2019re focused on the actions that we are taking to drive current performance in an environment that is pressuring growth, and we\u2019ll discuss how those actions will position us to deliver results in the near and the longer terms. Today, our business continues to grow, as demonstrated by third quarter performance. While global comparable sales of 0.9% were not as high as we\u2019d like, operating income grew 6% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.52, a 7% increase in constant currencies. Even though our comp sales lap eases in the fourth quarter, macroeconomic and competitive conditions are not expected to change dramatically. As a result, we expect October sales to be relatively flat. Around the world, we are accelerating those initiatives that we believe will have the greatest impact on our customers within our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience, and broaden consumers\u2019 access to our brand. We\u2019re also thoughtfully adapting local market plans to remain relevant and appealing at a time when consumers are uncertain and the industry is stagnant. We continue to intensify our focus on the most critical tenets of the customer experience: the strength in our performance, menu quality and choice, customer service, affordability, and consumer engagement. I\u2019d like to briefly discuss each one of these. Regarding menu quality and choice, we must ensure that the true quality of our ingredients and food recipes are better known to all consumers, and that customers have choices across our menu to meet their taste desires and/or nutritional expectations. This includes featuring relevant and appealing new food and beverage news. Next, customer service. Simply stated, we must exceed our customers\u2019 expectations for fast, accurate, and friendly service at each and every one of our nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world. And furthermore, those restaurants must be clean, well-maintained, and contemporary. The third point is affordability. We need to offer compelling value options across all price tiers of our menu. And lastly, deepening [unintelligible]. This means creating stronger awareness and excitement around our menu and around our restaurants while further revealing the ways in which we\u2019re a good neighbor in communities around the world. We know that meeting customers\u2019 expectations in all of these areas is critically important to a great experience at McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019ll talk more about these tenets, including specific examples of actions we\u2019re taking around the world to elevate the McDonald\u2019s experience at next month\u2019s investor meeting on November 14. So let\u2019s take a look at the business across the globe, starting with the U.S. U.S. comparable sales were up 0.7% for the quarter, and operating income increased 5%. Our current sales performance was driven by a focus on bringing new and familiar taste to customers, exciting promotions, and an ongoing emphasis on affordability across our menu. We accelerated the timing of our Monopoly promotion in an effort to further increase awareness and encourage trial of recent new product introductions like Quarter Pounder line sandwiches and the new McWraps. Monopoly also reminds customers about our core menu classics. It drives traffic and builds average check while also engaging customers in a fun and familiar game experience that\u2019s only available at McDonald\u2019s. We also introduced Mighty Wings in the third quarter as a limited time offer. This [bold] (ph) new flavor addition to our U.S. menu originated in China and Hong Kong and has encouraged trade up to increase average check. While overall performance of Monopoly and Mighty Wings met our internal targets, it was not strong enough to offset current guest count trends. Our promotions and new products are complemented by our consistent value approach to offer affordable variety and choice across the menu. The Dollar Menu remains core to our high-low strategy, with products like the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger and the popular McChicken continuing to generate strong demand at the $1 price point. As we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Dollar Menu, we\u2019re leveraging the equity we\u2019ve built to ensure we continue to satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations for affordability. The new Dollar Menu and More platform is designed to provide every day predictable value beyond the $1 price point and will be supported with the weight of our national advertising. The sandwich lineup, which ranges from $1 to $2 adds new flavors and tastes to complement our existing favorites and provides additional pricing flexibility for the McDouble. In addition to the launch of Dollar Menu and More, we\u2019re balancing proven favorites with new tastes that add further excitement and variety to our menu. The return of the popular McRib sandwich and the Southwest Premium McWrap are examples of this flavorful balance that will be seen in restaurants within the United States. Now let\u2019s turn to Europe, where comparable sales were up 20 basis points for the quarter and operating income grew 8% in constant currencies. These results reflect strong performance in the U.K. and Russia and solid performance in France. Negative trends in Germany continue amidst the highly competitive environment. The U.K.\u2019s business momentum remained strong, and we continued to grow market share. This growth has been supported by our expanded beverage lineup and an ongoing breakfast focus. This month, we\u2019re launching Mocha in the U.K. and using this opportunity to introduce the McCafe brand across our entire range of espresso-based coffees. Following the successful launch of McCafe iced smoothies and frappes over the summer, this represents a significant step in our journey to become a beverage destination in the U.K. Russia delivered positive performance in the third quarter despite the lower inflationary environment that continues to limit our ability to take price. Successful food offers such as Tastes of the Season and the Ciabatta Beef Burger helped boost results for the quarter. France also delivered positive results for the quarter, marking its first positive quarter of comparable sales since the third quarter of 2012. The market continues to grow share in a contracting and [unintelligible] industry. A core menu focus, supported by strong marketing execution and an ongoing emphasis on affordability helped to drive our performance. The Big Tasty re-hit in September generated strong demand and the Classic Return campaign, which launched in August, proved to be successful drivers of France\u2019s performance during the quarter. Additionally, Petit Plaisirs and Casse Croute continue to do well by providing attractive offers at affordable price points. While we\u2019re pleased with these results, we\u2019re cautious about recent performance, especially given the volatility in France\u2019s economy. Germany\u2019s performance remains weak, as negative comparable sales and traffic trends continued through the third quarter. Competitive activity remains aggressive, and the decline in IEO category persists as the industry grapples with price-sensitive consumers. Today, affordability and specifically price value is key in Germany. We continue to evolve the balance between our base value and premium offers across the menu to address the near term needs of the marketplace. Now let\u2019s move over to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, or APMEA. Comparable sales were down 1.4% for the quarter, and operating income decreased 4% in constant currencies. Performance across our big three markets remains challenging. This reflects tough macroeconomic conditions along with the performance of recent new products and promotions that were unable to overcome our current negative guest count momentum. Across APMEA, we remain focused on driving performance through consistent price value offers, accelerating growth at key day parts, particularly breakfast and overnight, and by leveraging brand extensions to enhance the service and convenience of the McDonald\u2019s experience. Australia continues to balance new product news and strong promotional activity to appeal to customers in a highly competitive environment. Looking ahead, Australia is targeting opportunities in chicken and the family business to broaden customer appeal. Japan\u2019s negative comparable sales and traffic trends persist. We\u2019re committed to making improvements to our value platform in the near term in an effort to appeal to consumers who remain extremely price sensitive in this deflationary environment. At the same time, we\u2019re introducing new products and promotions to create excitement and attract customers into our restaurants. In China, comparable sales were down 3.2% for the quarter. As a key emerging market, China has significant long term opportunities across all three of our growth priorities. We\u2019re also evolving our value platform to give it a greater reach across day parts and meal occasions. At the same time, we\u2019re using limited time offers and promotions to create energy around new menu news, and we\u2019re leveraging brand extensions like kiosks and McCafes to reach our customers when, where, and how they want the McDonald\u2019s experience the most. Around the world, we remain focused on our customers. It\u2019s our top priority to deliver an experience that meets their evolving tastes and lifestyles. We recognize the opportunities that exist to profitably grow our business for the immediate and the longer term. We remain committed to making disciplined investments to fuel future growth and further differentiate Brand McDonald\u2019s. Our efforts to broaden accessibility through new restaurants and to modernize the customer experience by reinvesting in existing restaurants, including reimaging, technology, and convenience initiatives, remains a top priority. Consistent with our longstanding priorities regarding the use of cash, after investing in our business, we\u2019re committed to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, first through dividends and then share repurchases. In fact, we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.81 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $3.24. Combined with our share repurchases, we expect our total cash return to shareholders for 2013 to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. In times like these, our ability to stay focused on those factors within our control is absolutely critical. As important is our ability to look within, to understand what\u2019s working, what needs to change, and why and we must execute. Our decentralized local markets have the ability to test their plans and quickly course correct based on customer reactions. This is even more important in this environment because it allows us to identify the right tactics that resonate with consumers and that will drive our performance in the near and longer terms. Our culture is built on the premise of always putting the customer first, making them feel good about visiting McDonald\u2019s today and into the future. Our ability to deliver on that promise through our actions will enable us to deliver long term value for our system and for our shareholders. Thanks again, everyone. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Pete.\nPeter Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Our performance in third quarter speaks to the resiliency of our business model and our ongoing commitment to invest strategically and grow our business over the long term through a balanced approach of adding new units and increasing sales at existing restaurants. Despite modest comparable sales growth, McDonald\u2019s was able to achieve solid growth in revenues and income. While the growth has not been as high as recent years, we are confident in our ability to deliver significant shareholder value over time. Through the first nine months, revenues increased 2% and our combined operating margin increased 10 basis points to 31.2%, primarily due to higher franchise margin dollars and lower G&A expenses. With 81% of our nearly 35,000 restaurants franchised, our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In the third quarter, franchise margins reached about $2 billion, an increase of 4%, or nearly $70 million in constant currencies, with each area of the world contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter declined 40 basis points to 83% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy costs. Global company operated margins totaled $919 million for the quarter, and were relatively flat in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 40 basis points to 18.7% as weaker performance in the U.S. and APMEA offset gains in Europe. In the U.S., third quarter company operated margins declined 140 basis points to 18.4% due to higher operating and commodity costs. Commodity costs increased about 2.5% in the third quarter, with similar pressure expected in the fourth quarter. We have tightened our full year estimates and now project 2013 commodity costs in the U.S. to be up 1.5% to 2%. We have taken three price increases year to date, with the most recent increase in September totaling about 1%. This brings our total increase to about 2.6%, which is relatively consistent with a year ago. We are at the midpoint of the projected 2% to 3% full year increase for food away from home inflation. Food at home inflation has been running at about a point lower, so we are keeping a close eye on this measure as well as we consider future price moves. In Europe, third quarter company operated margins increased 70 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to the strength of our two largest McOpCo markets, Russia and the U.K. These two markets contribute nearly half of Europe\u2019s company operated margin dollars. In addition, France, the third-largest market in terms of McOpCo margin dollars, contributed through positive comparable sales and certain labor efficiencies, most of which we don\u2019t expect to realize in the fourth quarter. Commodities increased about 1% for the quarter. Europe has also lowered its full year projected increase to 1.5% to 2%. Our price increases varied across the 39 European markets. Excluding Russia, most European markets are averaging year over year price increases around 1.5%. As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment, increased taxation, and lower disposable income. Our global strategy and approach to pricing remains unchanged. We continue to balance our goal of driving traffic and market share gains while effectively managing the impact of rising costs and evolving consumer trends. Turning to Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 160 basis points to 15.3%, primarily due to higher labor costs across the segment as well as new restaurant openings, mainly in China. For a perspective, China represents approximately 30% of APMEA\u2019s company operated margin dollars. Our G&A expense in the quarter declined 11% or more than $66 million versus a year ago. This was primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation and lapping the sponsorship of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games last summer. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be down 2% to 3% in constant currencies. Solid, consistent financial performance from our unique business model generates meaningful amounts of cash flow. We strategically reinvest a significant amount of this cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns. Our restaurant development teams are making good progress against their plans for building new restaurants and reimaging existing locations, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities. We have trimmed our 2013 capital expenditure estimate to $3 billion. This is a conscious decision to delay a limited number of new openings into 2014 based on current conditions. We feel this is prudent given the short term pressures and our desire to maximize the quality of our new openings. We continue to generate strong returns at new restaurants in mature markets with emerging markets like China historically achieving our benchmarks within three to four years. In 2013, we expect to open about 1,500 new restaurants, ending the year at over 35,000. New openings by are of the world include over 225 in the U.S., about 300 in Europe, and more than 750 in APMEA. Approximately one-third of our global openings are in development of license or affiliated markets where we do not invest our capital. We also continue to modernize our existing restaurant base through reimaging more than 1,600 restaurants this year. Globally, about two-thirds of our interiors and over half of our exteriors reflect the current contemporary look. Let\u2019s now turn to foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted third quarter results by $0.01. At current exchange rates, including the euro at the $1.35/$1.36 level, we expect full year EPS to be negatively impacted by about $0.05 to $0.06, which implies a fourth quarter negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02. Please take this as directional only, given the volatility in exchange rates. Lastly, I\u2019d like to comment on our expectations for the remainder of this year. On the first quarter call in April, I said that we expected company operated margins to be pressured throughout 2013, though the margin decline should be less pronounced than in the first quarter, as sales comparisons ease in upcoming quarters. Let me give you an update. Though sales comparisons have eased and will continue to do so, our current sales trends are a stronger predictor of future performance than prior year comparisons. As a result, based on what we know today, we expect fourth quarter global comparable sales performance to be in line with recent quarterly trends and restaurant margin percentage declines, both McOpCo and franchised, to be at a level relatively similar to first quarter declines. We\u2019re wrapping up our planning cycle over the next few weeks, and we look forward to sharing some of our 2014 outlook with you at our November investor meeting next month. The McDonald\u2019s system remains focused on building our business to generate enduring, profitable growth for our shareholders, franchisees, and suppliers. Our third quarter results speak to the benefit of our geographic diversification and the many levers we have to generate top and bottom line growth. We are confident in our ability to successfully navigate this environment while preserving our competitive advantages and positioning the brand to participate fully when consumer spending improves. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin the Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Keith, I\u2019ll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.\nJoseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I\u2019m going to ask a very near-term question. Looking at the year ago October performance, this comparison looks pretty easy and obviously you\u2019re guiding to a relatively flat number. So I\u2019m curious if things have worsened yet, if perhaps the government shutdown and debt ceiling discussions may have impacted U.S. business or sort of what drove that? And then kind of a related question, the margins held up fairly well, very, very well. They were actually up in Europe this quarter. So why the greater margin deterioration in the fourth quarter? Is there something unusual going on?\nDon Thompson : I\u2019ll take the first part, and then I\u2019ll ask Pete to speak to your question relative to margins. Regarding October, and it\u2019s really October in the fourth quarter, we expect the fourth quarter to remain challenged based on some of the existing top line pressures that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing flat or declining IEO markets and heightened competitive activity across all the geographies. And even though the comp sales lapped \u2013 do ease in the fourth quarter, heightened macroeconomic and competitive pressures are not expected to change dramatically as we said. In Europe, we\u2019ve got less pricing power than we had a year ago, and consumer psyche is affected by both the economies and also some of the upcoming austerity measures, VAT pressures, etc. In the U.S., we continue to experience a bifurcation of the consumer base. McDonald\u2019s core customers skew towards those customers whose disposable income is not rising as much and are spending a little bit less in QSR. And so as we look at those things, as we look at the macroeconomic conditions that persist in APMEA and across APMEA, we believe that this fourth quarter is still going to be relatively challenged as we mentioned. Regarding the government and the shutdown, you asked a question about that, actually for us at McDonald\u2019s, the impact is limited to a few different areas. One would be communities with large federal employees and those populations where a lot of the consumers there, their purchasing power may be limited based upon the government shutdown if the government employees or impacted by it. Another is from a supply chain perspective, in port authorities, when things like that happen from an impact perspective, the port authorities are operating at reduced level, so that changes the importation processing times for some of the products that we may have. And lastly, it\u2019s things like the e-Verify program, Federal e-Verify program, when it\u2019s closed down and the impact it has relative to hiring processes, so you can see that outside of that first one, which really gets into population impact, it\u2019s fairly minimal at this point relative to what\u2019s taking place from a government perspective.\nPeter Bensen: And regarding margins, you pointed out exactly the difference between the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter and that was Europe. The two markets that really had the biggest impact on that improvement in the third quarter in Europe were Russia and France. Combined, they basically contributed to 70 basis points of growth. While the U.K. had growth, it was pretty much offset by the other markets. And France, we had some exceptional labor efficiencies due to their higher sales levels in the quarter that we don\u2019t expect in the fourth quarter. And in Russia, we had a true-up of some of their distribution costs that resulted in a credit that added some improvement to the margins there. Last year, that true-up happened in the fourth quarter, so their margins in the fourth quarter were a little higher last year based on that. So on a comparative basis, we don\u2019t get that benefit. So at the end of the day, based on the current sales trends and the lack of a couple of these unusual items, we don\u2019t expect there to be that growth in Europe margins in the fourth quarter leading the consolidated margins to be more in line with the declines we saw first quarter.\nKathy Martin : Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley : My question\u2019s on the U.S. It sounds like you\u2019re saying that the promotions you\u2019ve run the last couple of months have been sort of in line with what you expected, but the underlying business is just so weak, and I just wanted to challenge that. Can you sort of back up why you think these promotions have been effective, because they seem like they\u2019re not driving incremental traffic to the business? Are you focusing too much on the short term for example whereas remember in prior periods you were winning from a position of strength? And can you also just talk about the Dollar and More menu? It didn\u2019t seem to work a couple of years ago, because the consumers still thought dollar meant dollar, not more. So why does that work this time do you think?\nDon Thompson : I\u2019ll talk a little bit about both of the areas. Relative to promotions, actually the promotions themselves have been within the range of our expectations. As an example, if I look at Mighty Wings, Mighty Wings resonated with consumers but performed at the lower end of our expectations, and your comment about overall base and base trendlines was very accurate. When you see the overall industry being a bit softer, it does impact our ability for us to drive sales to a higher level. But when it speaks specifically to the wings, there were a couple of things that, although it performed within our targeted expectation range, again at the lower end, there\u2019s a couple of things we can improve on, one is still affordability. $1 per wing was still not considered to be the most competitive in the current environment. The other thing we saw, and it\u2019s a very slight modification, but the flavor profile was slightly spicy for some consumers. But having said that, what\u2019s interesting is we sold or expect to sell probably about 35 million pounds of wings. We can address the challenges with spice, or as we look forward, price, you will see wings again in the U.S. business. It has been successful for us. But it is at a time when the overall environment is a bit softer. They create trade-up as most of the products that we\u2019ve introduced have done. Remember that as we went into this year, one of the things we wanted to do was to make sure that we had an innovative food pipeline, but we did not want to forget core classics, and we have tried to do that. Monopoly helped us again with that. The other thing we wanted to do is make sure we remained affordable. And we\u2019ve been working on this around the globe. And that part I feel we still are operating from a position of strength in most of our markets. Markets where we have challenges, we\u2019re addressing those challenges in those markets. And so all in all, we\u2019re doing the things that I think we should do to position ourselves to grow this business. As the economy does come back a bit, we know that we\u2019ll benefit from that. But we\u2019re also not going to sit back and just wait. We are doing many things tactically to try to address the current environment, but we\u2019re not missing out on a long-term environment as well. The other piece I want to mention real quick is the notion of Dollar Menu and More. And we have not tried Dollar Menu and More. One of the things that was attempted a while ago was something that was called an Extra Value Menu. This is very, very different. Dollar Menu and More means that you keep the Dollar Menu price points, and it\u2019s consistent with how we have continued to evolve the Dollar Menu, since its inception back in the early 2000. Over time, we have changed some of the products on the Dollar Menu as we\u2019ve needed to. We changed from a Big N\u2019 Tasty initially to a Double Cheeseburger, from Double Cheeseburger to McDouble, so we\u2019ve always evolved the dollar menu. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now, that continued evolution. But what we\u2019ve also found is the need to have a $2 price point for some products that are a slight trade up from just the dollar-based price points that also supports additional margin growth in the restaurants, and it gives customers a value ladder of sorts, so that based upon their discretionary spending, they have multiple offers at McDonald\u2019s. We also have a $5 price point, which really speaks to things like 20-piece nuggets. And so there\u2019s varying levels of affordability, and we still continue to have our Extra Value Meals and premium-based products that we\u2019ll talk to. So we\u2019ve definitely not forgotten our core, and the core classics of Big Mac and Quarter Pounders and Fish Filet, and those things you\u2019ll continue to see. We haven\u2019t forgotten the innovative food pipeline, McWraps, Mighty Wings, etc. And for us, we most definitely haven\u2019t forgotten our affordability platform with the Dollar Menu. So all of those things will play well together as we continue to come up with the most compelling menu offerings and compelling calendar for customers moving forward.\nKathy Martin : Next question\u2019s from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays : Question on the longer term business model. I\u2019ll preface it by saying beyond 2014, because I do know you have an analyst day coming up, where we\u2019ll get some color on that. But could you just maybe offer us some insight longer term? You mentioned the franchise business, 81% worldwide. Just wondering whether there\u2019s still an opportunity to push that? Obviously you still have huge skin in the game, but with 35,000 units, I\u2019m wondering whether over time the idea might not be to push that to 85% or 90%. And as a related question, the capex, I know you mentioned you tweaked it down in terms of dollars and modestly in terms of the unit openings, I\u2019m wondering whether that\u2019s at all a sign of future - I know you talk about maybe accelerating the pace of openings and whether this tweak might not be to signal that maybe things are slowing a little bit, or maybe you want to shift to more remodels and less new units. So, how you think about that.\nPeter Bensen : I\u2019ll talk about the capex, and Don will probably have a perspective on the franchising percentages. Really, the change in our capex this year has really been a short term thing. It speaks nothing about our view of the future. As we look at the environment, most of the unit cuts have come from China and some of the emerging markets in APMEA. So virtually all of the dollar variance from our original budget to our revised outlook is coming from APMEA. Europe will be on their opening budget, U.S. and the other areas of the world will hit. So it\u2019s really in China and some of these emerging markets where we\u2019re looking at where the projects were. In a lot of these countries, we rely in other retail development and housing development and some of the other development activity in the marketplace to create the traffic generators. And if they\u2019re delayed or behind schedule, there\u2019s been years where we would go ahead and open the restaurants anyway, knowing that that demand would be coming. And this year we\u2019re just taking a little more prudent look at those kind of projects in light of the sales environment, to say, you know what, we\u2019ll hold off and wait for those traffic generators to open or those projects to continue before we\u2019ll open the restaurant. So it\u2019s really just some fine tuning and not an indication of going forward we\u2019re looking to change our capex mix more toward reimaging and backing off of openings. We still think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to grow to the market potential in several of these countries by opening new units.\nDon Thompson : And relative to franchising, as we move forward, your point is appropriate, we continue to look at opportunities. So today we\u2019re 81% franchised globally, 19% company operated. We continue, particularly across areas we\u2019re growing in such as APMEA, we\u2019ll be continuing to leverage our DLs, to look for new DLs as we\u2019re doing across China. We\u2019re continuing to move forward conventional franchisees and conventional licensing. And so we continue to do that. APMEA will continue to see more franchising across the market. In addition to that, we\u2019re also looking at the mature markets and existing markets, where there are opportunities for us to effectively franchise as we continue to grow the business. And so yes, we will continue to definitely look at franchising, franchise opportunities. And you\u2019ll see it more particularly across APMEA.\nKathy Martin : Our next question is from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you, it\u2019s [Ivan Holman] sitting in for Michael. I was just wondering, the Dollar Menu itself has represented, historically, 13% to 14% of sales. Can you please give us a little bit of guidance on how you see that evolving in the near term, as well as from a longer term perspective in terms of how you see the business model over the next couple of years? And within that context, how do you think franchisees might be receptive to a change of that percentage, either up or down?\nDon Thompson : Just relative to the Dollar Menu, I think that we will continue to look first at customers, and customer behaviors, and affordability. And what we\u2019ve always done is leverage that data and then as we had discussions with the franchisee body, to look at what\u2019s going to be the most compelling offering for McDonald\u2019s. And again, the Dollar Menu\u2019s only a part of that. We continue to see and believe that it will continue to represent somewhere in that same percentile, 13% to 15%. As we stretch out the Dollar Menu a little bit more with Dollar Menu or More and provide some additional offers that will be even more appealing to customers, we believe that it will continue to be a compelling offer, and still best-in-class when we look at the overall marketplace. And so that part will remain the same. Franchisees have been a part of the discussions. They always are as we look at making decisions like this one.\nKathy Martin : The next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird : Don, I think you mentioned in your initial remarks that you\u2019re focusing or have been focusing on what\u2019s working well around the globe, and what needs to change. So I was particularly interested in maybe the last part of that. What do you think needs to change going forward? And perhaps if you could give us some examples of some maybe bigger picture or more meaningful changes as you look out to next year, or even the following year, just as you\u2019re planning your business.\nDon Thompson : I\u2019ll start at the back end of that and then go into what needs to change. I think as we look at next year, clearly the areas of, we call it the three global opportunities that we have, those things will remain the same. And so we\u2019re still focused on making sure that we have the best menu across the board for customers. We\u2019ll continue to balance that between the core classics and favorites with new products, and we\u2019ll continue to enhance that relative to the nutritional offerings that we have. So that\u2019s been a focal point, and that has been working around the world. The modernizing customer experience is something we\u2019ve been focused on and that really deals with our reimaging and making sure the restaurants are contemporary. That part has been received well by customers. We continue to do that. The strong portion of that, and Pete mentioned it, is that when you look across Europe, Europe is much further ahead there. So we won\u2019t have to do as many globally, but we\u2019ll leverage what we do need to do to make sure we are a compelling offer to customers around the world. Technology is going to be a big part of our future, particularly digital engagement with consumers. And so you\u2019ll hear us and see us talk much more about digital engagement with consumers. The other thing that you\u2019ll see change a bit is we are being much stronger relative to communicating about our brand, communicating about our food. Customers want to hear more about transparency. They want to hear about provenance and where the food is from. So those things we\u2019re very proud of at McDonald\u2019s, and we\u2019ll continue. At the November 14 NIM meeting, we\u2019ll discuss more about some of these opportunities. When it comes to changes, we\u2019ll chat a little bit about that in November as well, but frankly we\u2019ve got a few markets where we have opportunities and we\u2019ve been, again, very transparent about those. In Japan, we\u2019ve got to get consistent value, and it\u2019s a deflationary environment and a tough market, so we\u2019re focused on that. We\u2019ve had some leadership changes in Japan and we continue to look at the opportunities we have in that marketplace. Germany is a market that we are also focused on solidifying the balance between premium and the value based offerings. We fluctuated a bit there, possibly too much, and we need to shore that up. Australia we\u2019re focused in a very competitive environment, on making sure we have that same balance. And in the U.S. we\u2019ve got a great food pipeline now. We\u2019re focused well on the operational base of what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace. And those things, again, you\u2019ll get to hear a little bit more about at the NIM meeting in November, but those are some of the areas and some of the markets that we\u2019re focused more intently on.\nKathy Martin : Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the value menu domestically. Do you feel like you\u2019re winning that value game here in the U.S.? And then is that a segment that can actually drive sales and profits higher? Or do you think more or less that the dollar menu as it is is maybe something that helps you hold those guest counts in place in a tough environment and it takes more the success on those higher end of those more premium items to really return to stronger same-store sales and profit growth?\nDon Thompson : Great question, and the answer is yes. The dollar menu definitely, particularly in times like these, where you see consumers stressed a little more from a discretionary spending perspective, and you see a bit of bifurcation relative to the economic strata in the U.S., it\u2019s very important to have that affordability platform and the dollar menu that we have. So it does keep a base of customers. Keep this in mind, while it only represents 13% of 15% of sales historically, you\u2019ve got about a third of the customers that will leverage that dollar menu in some form or fashion. And so it is a strength part of the base. Having said that, we also have to have core news, and the core has to be affordable at a value menu price point, and premium based news whether that be McWraps or Might Wings. Those are promotional, those are limited time offers. But those things help not only with margin, but they help with the excitement for customers, so there\u2019s something new and exciting at McDonald\u2019s. And so we have to be able to balance both of those two ends of the barbell, if you will. And also, I would say we have to fill in what\u2019s in between. That\u2019s the reason for Dollar Menu and More. We\u2019ve talked about $2 price points with sandwiches that have a few additional things to offer than our base value dollar menu offerings do.\nKathy Martin : Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.\nMatt DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets: Just looking at the franchise margins in the guidance, I appreciate the guidance you give given the volatility we\u2019re seeing in the comps and everything for the current quarter that we\u2019re in now. Can you just sort of give us some sort of what you expect in trends for \u201914, especially with the franchise side of the margins? Is there anything structural that you\u2019re doing as far as relief plans or anything that might continue into \u201914 that you can give us an outlook on now? Or is it just simply comps coming back and the franchise margins improving in step with the comps?\nPeter Bensen : We will get into 2014 in a little more detail in November, but essentially there\u2019s nothing structural that\u2019s changing. As you\u2019ve pointed out, and we continue to mention, it is really a top line game, and our franchise margins are even more sensitive to comp, because a great proportion of the costs in that line are fixed. So when we generate higher comps, we get the significant leverage. The only thing structural that\u2019s been going on the last couple of years has been our contribution toward reimaging with franchisees, so as we coinvest with them, we continue to get greater amounts of depreciation, but again, with comp sales increases, that should not be a barrier to the margin growth. But as you point out, in this current environment, we\u2019re not getting that top line, so we don\u2019t expect the franchise margin to grow in the fourth quarter.\nKathy Martin : The next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nMike [Tamis] - Oppenheimer: This is Mike [Tamis] on for Brian. Is there anything in G&A that can be cut if sales trends continue to underperform? And then if there are any quick comments you can give on the China business of why that continues to struggle.\nPeter Bensen : I\u2019ll talk about G&A and Don maybe can give a perspective on China. When we look at our total G&A mix, what we\u2019re doing in this current environment is really looking at what are the discretionary items that we can kind of pull as levers to moderate short term performance. So, travel, meetings, open head count, things like that are things that we look at in environments like this. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re about growing this business for the long term. And so we\u2019re going to continue to make investments in things like technology, especially digital that Don mentioned. We\u2019re going to continue to make investments in our restaurant development teams and in the tools and processes to continue to grow restaurants. So as we look forward, there\u2019s no dramatic restructuring or anything like that that\u2019s going to happen, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest our G&A in the areas that we think are good for the long term growth of the business.\nDon Thompson : Relative to China, I\u2019ll give a bit of an overall perspective as to what we\u2019re seeing at least and then just a little insight as to McDonald\u2019s business as well. There is and has been, as you all know, a slowing of the economy. The GDP is at its slowest growth level in 23 years, and that\u2019s causing a little bit of a credit crunch across China. Slight decline in consumer confidence that goes along with that as consumer sentiment is very cautious, is the way I would describe it. GDP is expected to be in the mid-sevens for the rest of the year. Typically anything below an 8% is a bit concerning, but nonetheless we do see, across China, some bright spots and for the long term, definitely see a bright opportunity in China. Today, IEO is flat to declining. That makes it a little bit more difficult for growth. And the Chinese typically, in tougher economic times, they typically revert to what we would call CQSR, Chinese QSR, noodle shops, etc., than they do Western QSR-based companies. So these are things and phases we\u2019ve seen before. We\u2019re solidifying our affordability and opportunities to reach the customers with some of the products that we have. Breakfast has performed positively for us in the marketplace. We\u2019ve got a broader strategy around how we engage Millennials and own the night, as we call it, because that\u2019s a big opportunity for us. And again, we continue to look at our menu mix across the board. One last point, and that is Pete mentioned G&A, and we get asked about it quite a bit. One other thing I would add is I would keep in mind that our compensation - so when we talk about a savings in G&A based upon performance based incentives or performance based compensation, if we are not hitting the expectations we have in sales and operating income, then that compensation is at risk. And that is a good balance. It\u2019s a good hedge within our overall formulas and the way we operate as McDonald\u2019s. And so we constantly look at our G&A to make sure we\u2019re making prudent investments for the future, and those investments yielding appropriate returns for our shareholders.\nKathy Martin : Next question is John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thanks, it\u2019s [Ahmod Gallan] filling in. Can you address some specifics or concerns on how your speed of service and operations scores in the U.S. have trended over the past year given some of the changes in menu? You\u2019ve had the new POS in place for I think almost a couple of years now, and other aspects like scaling up dual drive throughs, but are there any specific opportunities that you\u2019ve identified for further improvement in 2014?\nDon Thompson : There are quite a few things that we continue to look at. Clearly service for us, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is a critical performance factor and an experience factor for customers. When we add something like a dual-lane drive through, on a per-car basis, if you looked at flowthrough speed, we typically will see a couple second increase in a flowthrough kind of a measure, because you now have two lanes and they split off. For an individual customer, they get attended to quicker and the absolute times that we see tend to be overall shorter for the experience. And so the dual lane drive through has helped, and it has helped us with capacity. When we implement new products, there\u2019s always a softer period upon the launch of the new products, and then there\u2019s a recovery. The more ingredients in a product, yes that will impact service times, but our operating platform of made for you basically enables us to be able to implement those types of products. So I would tell you at this point the operational focus is strong. There are different measures that come through each and every year relative to customer satisfaction. What we\u2019re focused on is our internal measures of whether or not we\u2019re satisfying the needs of customers from a fast perspective, an accuracy perspective, and then I will tell you the quality of that service and the friendliness of that interaction.\nKathy Martin : Next question is Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein : I wanted to step back if I could and just ask you about the demand environment and your results. And I guess if I think back to the recession, \u201908 to \u201909, your comps were better and certainly a lot better than your competitors vis-\u00e0-vis where they are today. And I think it would be hard for us to say that the demand environment was a whole lot better back then than is the case now. So I was just hoping you could help me just diagnose is the issue your competitors are a lot better? Is the issue that you don\u2019t have quite as much of a sales layer opportunity? Just maybe if you can help me compare and contrast. And then a related question is how are your franchisees doing in this environment? Obviously there\u2019s always some talk in the media about McDonald\u2019s relationships, and I just wanted to get your take on that.\nDon Thompson : Just having been the president in the U.S. when we went through this back in 2008 to 2009, I would tell you things that were similar and some that were different. Clearly there was a, from a consumer discretionary spending perspective, it was a very timid if not restricted environment. Having said that, though, the competition at that point was not as strong from a pure price perspective. We had just evolved our dollar menu, just as we\u2019re talking about doing now with Dollar Menu and More. We had just completed that evolution. As you all may recall, we went from a Double Cheeseburger to a McDouble, and we talked about snack wraps a little more strongly. So we were talking about affordability in the same way that we\u2019re doing now, and plan to do even more so in the U.S. business. We had just begun really focusing on the coffee opportunity. I think you\u2019ll hear more about the coffee opportunity, as it still does exist, and you\u2019ll hear more about that at the NIM meeting. And so those things are fairly consistent in terms of how we approach it. Again, definitely more competition in the marketplace. We\u2019re getting back to that focus on the value, the coffee, and those interim pieces. I would tell you we had a pretty decent product innovation at that point, and I think that what you\u2019ve seen this past year is getting us back on track with that in the U.S. as well. Relative to the franchisees, I was just recently at our national leadership council meeting as they meet with the U.S. leadership team. And I\u2019ve not seen as strong an alignment in quite a few years. I think everyone understands the environment that we\u2019re facing. They also understand the legislative environment that we\u2019re facing. Those things cause us at McDonald\u2019s to really consolidate our different needs and desires and really focus on the customer. And so that\u2019s what they were doing, and I left there feeling pretty good about what I was seeing and sensing from the operator leadership group and from our U.S. leadership team, and them all being on the same page. So notwithstanding different reports that will come out, it\u2019s wonderful to live in this world and get a chance to see and visit with the franchisees, not only in the U.S. but around the world.\nKathy Martin : Next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller - Piper Jaffray: I was hoping you could help us close the gap, or get more color around, your pricing. I understand the comment about limiting pricing power, but you do have a very sophisticated process. So maybe compare and contrast what that process has told you to do historically versus what it\u2019s telling you to do today. And maybe, if it makes sense, could you tell us how it impacted taking the dollar menu to a dollar more? And then sorry for this part, but if you have it could we get the gap in September of U.S. comp versus QSR?\nPeter Bensen : I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the pricing. So, traditionally, we strive to keep our price increases in line with food away from home. And for the year, food away from home is projected to be up 2% to 3%. And where we sit today, we\u2019re at about a 2.6% increase. So we\u2019re kind of in line with that measure as we look at it. The other dynamic that we have to keep in mind is what\u2019s going on with food prices at the grocery store. And so the food at home price increases are actually growing about 100 basis points less. So through August, I think was the last data I saw, food at home was only up 1%. So that does create a value perception with the consumer that we do have to keep an eye on. So those are the two biggest factors that we look at as we\u2019re looking at our pricing, as well as using our model that actually goes back in time and looks at a history of all of the price increases by individual item, by restaurant, and look at what happened to demand at those various price changes to make sure we\u2019re optimizing the menu price changes that we do choose to make. So that\u2019s how we continue to look at that. And for the month of September, which is really the four weeks ended the 29th, our gap was actually positive 10 basis points to the QSR sandwich. On a year to date basis, that gap is 0.7.\nDon Thompson : Relative to dollar menu products, I want to make sure everyone understands, the dollar menu, there will still be a dollar menu. What we\u2019ve changed is \u201cand more\u201d which means we\u2019re adding products that are $2 level and there will be some $5 level products, and there may be some other fill ins. So I want to make sure no one thinks that we\u2019re abandoning the dollar menu. That is not something that will be part of our affordability strategy, particularly not at a time like this. And so this is one of the ways that we can maintain the dollar menu in the face of rising commodities and labor pressures, but also get a little bit more margin basis on some of the products at $2 and some of the products at higher price points from there, and the franchisees support this. I think when you listen to Pete, and he talked about the comp sales gaps in the QSR sandwich industry, clearly we at McDonald\u2019s are still in a very viable and strong position. The challenge for us is still there is softness in the QSR industry. And we have the right things in place, I believe, for the long term to continue to drive shareholder value.\nKathy Martin : Okay, we have four more folks that we\u2019re going to try to get to, because we\u2019re running out of time. Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo?\nJeff Farmer - Wells Fargo : Just did some quick math there on Nicole\u2019s question. It looks like 70 basis points of sequential improvement in share, September versus August. So I guess the question is, what do you attribute that improved share from month to month to?\nPeter Bensen : To clarify, our gap between us and the QSR sandwich competition year to date September is 70 basis points. For the month of September, it was only 10 basis points.\nDon Thompson : And those are our sales gaps. And what we attribute it to is the fact that we did have successful promotions relative to what we\u2019ve done with Mighty Wings. We\u2019ve had some good products with wraps. Those things we have. The challenge, again, that we have is in an industry and an IEO industry that\u2019s been contracting a bit, and also as spending has kind of split, we call it a bifurcation of spending, what we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve seen those customers that, to the moderate, middle to low ends, are a little bit more stressed from a discretionary spending perspective. And so that part\u2019s a bit of a wait. At the same time, as you can see from those comp sales gaps, we still have offers that are appealing to consumers.\nKathy Martin :\n :\nR.J. Hottovy - Morningstar: Appreciate the color on the fourth quarter margins, and your expectations that restaurant margin pressures will be similar to the first quarter, but I expect that the magnitude of the different line items will be different. Could you elaborate on where the different variations from the first quarter might be on the different food, labor, and occupancy line items? Any color here would be appreciated.\nPeter Bensen : At this point, we\u2019re not going to get into that level of detail on our outlook. We really were just trying, in this environment where the general expectation was that we would improve as these comparisons ease, we wanted to give some directional perspective on where we thought the numbers would settle out. Obviously in January we\u2019ll get into a lot of the details on what drove the actual. The one item I will mention, though, as we move throughout the year, the commodity cost pressure actually is a little bit greater in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and that\u2019s just really more a factor of specifically some of the proteins that were a little more benign earlier in the year, and us having hedges in place, which actually protect our grain costs throughout the year and really don\u2019t allow us to participate in sharp declines when they do happen, yet over time provide us with that predictability and stability.\nKathy Martin : Next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAndy Barish - Jefferies : It looks like, even with maybe some pushback on the new unit opening front, it\u2019s still going to be a heavy fourth quarter opening schedule versus last year. I know oftentimes it\u2019s back end weighted, but is that factoring into some of the margin discussion as well?\nPeter Bensen : No, it actually isn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t looked market by market, but the fourth quarter new restaurant openings aren\u2019t dramatically different than we see traditionally year after year. And in fact the new store drag, if you will, the new store impact on margins in China and APMEA has actually sequentially gotten a little bit better. So there\u2019s nothing in those opening numbers that is adding to the pressure in the fourth quarter.\nKathy Martin : And we\u2019re going to take our last question from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research. And for those of you who we didn\u2019t get to, please feel free to call IR.\nMitch Speiser - Buckingham Research : Just one final question on the margin outlook. And I know it\u2019s a global margin outlook. In particular, just in the U.S. you did take some incremental pricing. You did give us some pieces of the cost outlook, but I was just wondering if the weaker margin outlook is due to maybe the chicken wing costs, or just a little bit of increased discounting versus prior quarters, if those are issues in the overall margin outlook as it relates to the U.S.\nPeter Bensen : They\u2019re not really. As I said, in the U.S. the commodities, the chicken, the beef, and actually our new bacon are the three biggest impacts on commodity costs vis-\u00e0-vis the first quarter, partially offset by some of the lower grain costs. So it\u2019s really, as I mentioned in one of the earlier answers, the biggest changed from where we are in the third quarter is really being driven by Europe in terms of the global margin, and that was due to some of the more unusual or one-time kind of items that led to the increase in their third quarter margin.\nKathy Martin : Okay, we\u2019re out of time, so I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don with the final closing talk.\nDon Thompson : Everyone, once again thanks for joining us this morning. As we wrap up the call today, I just want to reiterate our commitment to balancing thoughtful and strategic decisions for the long term with informed and decisive actions that we must take within our markets to continue to actively adjust the plans to strengthen our connection with customers, and also to position ourselves to grow the business profitably. We\u2019ve balanced both of those things together. I\u2019m confident in our ability to deliver long term growth for the system and for our shareholders as we continue to optimize our menu, as we look for additional ways to strengthen and modernize the customer experience, and as we broaden accessibility around the world within the framework of our plan to win. Thanks again, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-07-22 14:59:02", "content": "Executives: Don Thompson - President and CEO Tim Fenton - COO Peter J.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions) I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton is here Q&A. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via the phone, webcast and podcast. And before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at our website www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as a reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin by briefly framing our performance using three lenses. The past, the present, and the future. First the past, because it provides perspective and guides our present and future. Throughout McDonald\u2019s history, we respectively grown both the top and the bottom lines to varying degrees across a variety of economic and competitive cycles. We have an iconic brand an outstanding system of owner-operators, suppliers and employees and superb real estate locations in nearly every market around the world. This provides a solid foundation from which we operate. Second, the present. In second quarter we grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share, despite the ongoing impact of the challenging environment. This is truly a testament to the fortitude and resilience of our system, our sustainable competitive advantages, and the collective focus on execution at our restaurants. And third the future. We expect the dynamics of this cycle should persist in the near-term, namely flat to declining informal eating out markets, increasingly less ability to take price, cost pressures throughout our P&L and heightened competitive activity. Our second quarter results tells story consistent with these lenses. Global comparable sales were up 1%, operating income was up 3% and constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.38, a 6% increase in constant currencies. And as we begin the third quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be relatively flat in July. Based on our recent sales trends, our results for the rest of the year are expected to remain challenged. We remain committed to the plan to winning our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience, and to broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s around the world. This customer centric plan enables us to deliver an appealing experience by offering great tasting, affordable food and beverages, and clean and modern restaurants. At the same time, we are diligently implementing thoughtful adjustments to our proven strategies and solutions when and where needed. This flexibility has enabled us to maintain or grow market share in most of our major markets around the world. Let's review ours results in every geographic business units, starting with the United States, where comparable sales for the quarter were up 1% and operating income was flat. We continue to appeal to our customers with an increased emphasis on new news across our menu, and an ongoing focus on everyday affordable value. The Dollar Menu remains a foundational component of our strategy to consistently deliver value across the menu, rather than implementing aggressive short-term discounting tactics. At the same time, our focus on enhancing core classics and offering additional premium products, continues to provide customers with even more variety and choices across day parts and price points. This quarter we introduce new items across all four key growth categories, chicken, beef, breakfast and beverages. Premium McWraps launched in April, the Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie and Egg White Delight debuted in May and last month we added fresh new taste to our Quarter Pounder Burgers with three new flavorful recipes, Bacon Habanero Ranch, Lettuce Tomato Deluxe and Bacon & Cheese. From a comparable sales standpoint, these new menu additions individually met or exceeded targeted performance levels. However, softer IEO environment and comparisons against prior-year promotion with chicken and beverage activity offset the sales driven by the new menu news. And while June comparable sales were slightly negative in the U.S., we continued to outpace the competitive set. In June, I met with our leadership franchisees while they were in Oak Brook for one of their regularly scheduled meetings. While the challenges of operating a small business today are many, it is clear that we\u2019re aligned and focused on what's most important and that's the customer. It\u2019s that commitment to remaining customer centric, along with the assertive plans and vision we have in place, that enables all three legs of the McDonald\u2019s system to grow sales and profitability for the long-term. Let's shift to Europe where comparable sales were down 10 basis points for the quarter and operating income was up 5% in constant currencies. The U.K. and Russia continued to deliver positive results, while weak performance in Germany and France persist. The U.K.\u2019s business remains solid. Second-quarter results and continued market share growth were driven by a balanced focus across value core new products and promotional offers. The U.K. launch blended ice beverages in June, just in time to satisfy customers craving for something cool and refreshing during the summer months. The lineup includes two delicious fruit smoothies, strawberry and banana and mango and pineapple, and a line of frappes including Carmel and Iced Mocha. Inspired by the U.S., these new products expand the overall beverage lineup and further validate blended ice as a proven system solution that can be deployed across markets worldwide. Russia also delivered positive performance for the quarter on top of last year's strong results. In addition to a focus on the Big Mac, two seasonal premium offerings, The Royal Cheeseburger and The Big Tasty with Bacon, contributed to Russia's performance and demonstrated the strong ongoing appeal of our brand in this growth market. We expect the lower inflationary environment in Russia to continue dampening our pricing power, pressuring near-term sales momentum compared to last year. Moving over to France, comparable sales and guest count performance remained negative as the recession continues to pressure the informal eating out industry. However, we\u2019re growing market share by balancing value and premium products across the menu. For example, France recently added two new recipes to the popular Casse-Croute entr\u00e9e and drink combo. They contributed to market share growth during the lunch day part. This value offer was complemented by a strong focus on two premium beef burgers, Le M and Le 280. In Germany, negative comparable sales and traffic trends persist. Our traffic has declined at a faster rate than the IEO industry, which also continues to contract. It\u2019s critical that our initiatives resonate with consumers in this environment and in this marketplace. So to re-establish our momentum, we are leveraging recent consumer insights and continuing to adjust our plans. Let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa or APMEA. Comparable sales were down 30 basis points for the quarter and operating income increased 3% in constant currencies. Although market share improved in China, Australia, and Japan, comparable sales were negative for our big three markets. Positive performance in other markets like South Africa, Singapore, and South Korea partially mitigated the overall segment\u2019s decline. Markets across APMEA are taking a holistic approach to stimulating demand. Across day parts, they are offering limited time and innovative products alongside established price value platforms. In Australia, we continued to grow market share by balancing our focus on the core with new product introductions and promotional activities. Strong performance in 2012 including the launch of our Loose Change menu along with external pressures in 2013 from lower levels of consumer spending and heightened competitive activity have contributed to weaker performance. In Japan, consumers remain extremely price sensitive. Comparable sales have been positive the last two months, and we continue to grow share by leveraging limited time offerings like the Chicken Teritama and sharing options such as the Mega Potato to keep customers coming back to our restaurants and to build our average check. In China, comparable sales were down 6.1% for the second quarter reflecting the negative impact from avian influenza, which continues to dissipate. We remain focused on leveraging promotional activities to showcase the diversity of our menu beyond chicken and strengthening our connection with customers through our ongoing brand trust campaign that focuses on the quality and the safety of our food. We remain confident in our ability to drive future performance in China. Going forward, comprehensive plans for our key growth areas, particularly beverages, the family business, and the late night day part remain our top priorities. Around the world and across our system, we are focused on ensuring our strategies and tactics resonate with customers. That's the key, the key to our performance today and for the long term. As I mentioned earlier, our market teams continue to strategically and thoughtfully adjust their plans in response to local consumer dynamics and growth opportunities. At the same time, we remain committed to prudently investing our capital and resources in those initiatives that will further differentiate us from the competition for the long term. We're broadening accessibility by adding new restaurants, we're modernizing our existing restaurants with reimages and remodels, and we continue to deploy technology and convenience initiatives. As our predominantly franchised business model continues to generate significant levels of cash, our priorities regarding the use of cash have not changed. After investing in our business, we're committed to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, first through dividends and then through share repurchases. For the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  In closing I want to reiterate my confidence in our business and in the growth opportunities that exist. We are diligently focused on executing the proven strategies within our plan to win. We have a resilient business model, an aligned and talented system, and an experienced management team. We're leveraging these strengths and making deliberate, continued progress toward winning this battle for market share and fortifying our position as our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks Don, and hello everyone. McDonald's continued to grow revenues and net income in second quarter within the challenging global environment. The system remains focused on executing our strategies to become even more relevant to the 69 million customers we serve every day. We continue to adjust our tactics where prudent and are committed to optimizing those factors within our control. Our financial results for the second quarter reflect these efforts to strengthen near-term performance while continuing to build our business for the long term. For the six months ended June, system-wide sales increased 3% in constant currencies due to expansion. Combined operating margin declined 30 basis points to 30.3% over that same period, primarily due to lower restaurant margin percentages. We are primarily a franchisor with 81% of our global restaurants operated by local businessmen and women. Consolidated franchise margins contribute approximately 70% of our restaurant profits. This stable, predictable income stream benefits from comparable sales growth and is more insulated from inflationary and other cost pressures. For the quarter, each area of the world contributed to franchise margin dollars growing 4% in constant currencies to more than $1.9 billion. The margin percent declined 40 basis points to 82.8% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses. Global company-operated margin dollars declined 1% in constant currencies to $842 million for the quarter. The margin percent decreased 50 basis points to 17.7% as higher labor, commodity, and other costs more than offset slightly positive comparable sales. The margin pressures for the quarter were most acute in the U.S. and APMEA while Europe grew its McOpCo margin. In the U.S., second quarter company-operated margins declined 110 basis points to 18.7% due to higher labor occupancy and other operating costs. The McDonald's system is effectively managing commodity expenses with cost up about 1% in second quarter. The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 1.5% to 2.5%. The U.S. has been deliberate regarding pricing seeking to remain below the food-away-from-home inflation index of 2.2%. Another relevant data point is Food At Home index which is up only 0.9%, somewhat limiting our pricing power. At the end of June, our U.S. price increase was 1.5% which is about 120 basis points less than one year ago. As we move through the second half of the year, we will consider future price increases balancing our desire to grow traffic and market share amidst the reality of higher input costs. In addition to pricing, we're employing more suggestive selling strategies at the order point to encourage trials, new products and add-on purchases. As Don mentioned, it's a market share battle so we're employing a variety of strategies and tactics to grow traffic and increase relevance to our consumers. Turning now to Europe, company-operated margins were probably the biggest positive of the quarter as they increased 10 basis points to 19.4%. Europe's McOpCo margins benefited from the significant contribution from the UK and Russia, our two strongest performing markets in the region who contribute nearly half of the segments company-operated margin dollars. In addition, France and other markets realized labor productivity gains as part of their overall efforts to control costs and enhance efficiencies within the restaurants. Commodities increased about 2% for the quarter and for the full year, Europe's projected increase is now slightly lower at 2% to 3%. Europe is a collection of 39 markets, so our price increases vary by market with Russia at the higher end due to its inflation albeit a little less than a year ago and all other markets averaging about 1.5% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S. we have less pricing power in 2013 versus a year ago. In addition, given the economic environment in nearly all of our markets we're balancing a stronger emphasis on value with compelling premium products to effectively manage average check and margins. We have a strong underlying business in Europe and we believe we are making the right strategic decisions and value investments to protect and grow the band over the long term. In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 100 basis points to 14.3% due to new restaurant openings mainly in China along with higher labor costs throughout the segment. To a lesser extent, avian influenza impacted our sales and margins in second quarter, but our team work hard to manage expenses and other controllables to mitigate some of the negative impact. G&A discipline remains an area of focus. We seek to grow sales and revenues faster than our G&A spend. Year-to-date, G&A as a percent of revenues was 8.8% versus 9% a year ago, which included our biennial Worldwide Convention. For the full-year, as part of our ongoing efforts we have reduced our G&A spend and now expect it to be relatively flat versus the prior-year due in part to lower incentive compensation and efficiencies we have identified. The growth in revenues and operating income within our franchise business model translates into significant generation of cash. As Don reiterated, our first priority for this cash remains reinvesting in our business to drive future growth and returns. In light of the current environment we have trimmed our 2013 capital expenditure forecast by $100 million to about $3.1 billion. Although we will open about 50 fewer sites, we believe this is prudent given the short-term pressures. More importantly it will not undermine our long-term growth potential and the quality and returns of our new restaurants remain very solid. The remainder of our capital is being invested in existing restaurants, in part through reimaging more than 1,600 location\u2019s, we\u2019re making steady progress in our efforts to modernize our brand with about 50% of our exteriors and about 60% of our interiors on a global basis reflecting the current contemporary look. In the U.S. this year we will touch about 10% of our traditional brief standing portfolio through a combination of reimaging, rebuild and new restaurants, this will put us close to the 50% mark. Within the next year a U.S. customer more often than us will experience our brand in a more modern and relevant manner than before. We\u2019re excited about the potential that this brings to our largest market. Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted second quarter results by $0.02 more than originally forecasted as several currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. At current exchange rates we expect a negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02 on third quarter EPS with a full-year negative impact of $0.07 to $0.09. As usual though, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will continue to change as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Despite flat to declining and formal eating out markets around the world McDonald\u2019s grew revenue operating income and earnings per share in second quarter. Our results underscore the solid performance, the solid platform from which we are operating. A unique franchise business model that harnesses the entrepreneurial spirit of local businessmen and women will operate approximately 28,000 of our nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world. The powerful alignment of our system around the strategies and key growth priorities that have allowed us to maintain or grow our industry leading market share in most of our major markets and a strong financial foundation that allows us to invest for the future while making prudent decisions to deliver near term performance. We remain confident in our brand and the competitive advantages of our system which we believe will continue to drive positive results over the long-term. Thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.\nKathy Martin: Thanks, Pete. I am going to open the call now for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask a question, maybe a multiple-part question on U.S. sales. So you commented on the U.S. second quarter performance being better than the QSR sector as a whole. Could you quantify what you think the QSR sector did for the quarter and was that also true in the month of June for U.S. performance versus IEO, and maybe in conjunction with that, just talk about pulling monopoly forward, kicking it off this week, just the rationale behind that decision?\nDon Thompson: Hi Joe, this is Dan. Thanks so much for the question, and I\u2019ll try to address some of the points that you made, and you can -- if there\u2019s anything we missed, you let us know, but -- if we look overall in the U.S., it looks like and I\u2019ll speak from an informal eating out perspective. It appears that we gained about 10 basis points in the informal eating out category relative to traffic. So, we know that the things that we\u2019ve put in place are definitely having some impact and it also speaks to some of the things that took place relative to our focus on new products. And so, again looking at the U.S., we know that this year we were lapping some of the implementations of some of the beverage strategies from last year which launched a little bit earlier, Cherry Berry Chiller. We also know there was a frappe launch earlier in the year. We also had 20 piece nuggets that were launched last year. The great thing for us is that the products that we\u2019ve implemented in the chicken, breakfast, beverages, and beef category being Egg White Delight, Blueberry Pomegranate, the wraps, the Quarter Pounders, those things have performed well and met or exceeded the targeted sales, but again some of the offsets that Pete and I mentioned are some of the reasons that sales are softer aside from the fact that the informal eating out category is projected to be down about 50 basis points. So we know that, we put things in place to address that in the U.S. and we have outperformed the competition. We do know that we\u2019ve outperformed them on a year-to-date basis from a comparable sales performance by a little bit over 1%.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I guess just one that you guys didn\u2019t touch on there was around the Monopoly pull forward, if you could touch on that and then just bigger picture, the comments in the press release and in your prepared remarks about a challenging environment over the rest of the year, I don\u2019t think you guys normally talk about the forward outlook quite this much, so I am just wondering what are your thoughts, kind of what's changed since the April call, and would we be considering kind of challenges, meaning kind of flat comps continuing over the next several months, is that the kind of message that you\u2019re trying to send? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Thanks, Jason. As you know, we don\u2019t give -- we\u2019re not giving out guidance, that\u2019s not our practice. We do expect the remainder of 2013 to remain challenged based on existing top and bottom line pressures. We know we\u2019re seeing ongoing global economic headwinds. We\u2019re seeing flatter declining IEO markets and ongoing competition chasing fewer guest counts as a result of a less and discretionary spending. We also know that this is a more price sensitive timeframe based on these economies, and we still have ongoing P&L pressures including higher labor and commodity costs, and we have less ability to take that price. So, relative to those things, that\u2019s kind of the -- if you would, the framework around the comments that we made, we continue to believe the long-term, the average annual financial targets that we put in place are achievable and appropriate. We do know, however, in the near term that we\u2019re going to face some tough economies around the world and the informal eating out industry is softer around the world, and a matter of fact, 7 out of -- 11 out of our top markets we\u2019re seeing contraction from an IEO perspective.\nPeter J. Bensen: And Jason, regarding Monopoly, that was a decision last fall when the U.S. was looking at their calendar and looking at the product launch lineup thinking about, how do we follow-up the introduction of these great new products with a way to continue the momentum and we know that Monopoly is always a great transaction driver, and these new products are prominently featured in the Monopoly promotions, so following those product launches up with Monopoly, it seemed like a very prudent thing to do.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Hi, thanks very much. Following up on the U.S., Don when you see the IEO market in the U.S., what definition do you use for that? It seems to me, I recall that you use a broader definition than just a quick service hamburger market; and if that\u2019s the case, could any of the weakness be described by or explained by some of your near-end competitors doing better? And secondly, what is the dynamic in the U.S.? Is the low-end customer still there, but the high end maybe moved off and maybe they\u2019re not taking you up on some of the higher end offers, what's the dynamic underneath the weakness in comps?\nDon Thompson: All right, and thanks for the question John. First of all, the definition we use is really more of a protocol, is CREST. CREST is the information that we use relative to our informal eating out data, and they are fairly broad data base to your point. So we look at the overall informal eating out industry, that is what helps us whether it would be identifying opportunities or looking at who may or may not be doing as well in the industry at that point in time. So, it really is a good barometer of the overall marketplace that QSR segment is a little bit \u2013 it's a little bit more, I don't want to call it myopic, but it's a much smaller view of the overall marketplace. So as we've looked at that that's how we know that the overall marketplace was going to drop by about 50 basis points. Now the interesting thing about IEO is that QSR makes up the vast majority of IEO. And so, when you hear us talk about IEO, we are talking in a large part also about the QSR industry. As we look forward and if you look at who's winning, who's not winning in the marketplace, we do know that we've gained market share, we know there are a couple of other players that have gained market share. And what we do is we continue to look at our performance relative to the categories of growth which I mentioned earlier which were chicken, beverages, breakfast, and then we also look at the premium beef category which is why you saw it implement the Quarter Pounder line with the three different recipes which is why you've seen us leverage our beverage strategy, which we still have some opportunities to leverage that to an even greater extent. And so, we're going to continue to do that. But when you look across our product implementations this year, they have hit each of the growth categories, and so we feel fairly good. Those products have met or exceeded the expectations we had. As I mentioned, we did see some offset based upon last year's promotional activity particularly around 20 Piece Nuggets and in some of our beverage strategies.\nKathy Martin: Okay. Our next question is from Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner - Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Thanks. If I could just ask another U.S. question kind of more broadly thinking about the IEO market, it seems like a lot of the disappointment say versus our expectations at least on this side have come from IEO market disappointment. If you think through the fact that you've got food at home now running significantly below total food away from home, even though you're running below food away from home in terms of pricing, I guess what I'm asking is, is the setup that the food away from home industry might be pricing a little too aggressively in a low inflation environment? How do you think about the relative share trends across IEO versus food at home? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Hi, Keith. I'm going to let Pete talk a little bit about what's taking place and relative to our own pricing. What I would tell you and I mentioned it in my comments, one thing we do see in the broader industry is we're seeing a lot of discounting, price discounting rather than consistent value platforms which we have around the globe and we've put in place, and we're going to maintain that consistency because it's important to consumers. We know that, but we have seen a lot of, I'll say, sporadic price discounting across the marketplace. But relative to what we've done and how we've seen pricing, I'll ask Pete to make some comments.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Keith, one of the things I mentioned, we're up about 1.5 in pricing in the U.S. on a trailing 12-month basis. That's 120 basis points below where we were a year ago. It's clearly one of the factors that is contributing to comps maybe being not as strong as some would think. When we look at the dynamics at food away from home, it's up 2.5%; food at home up only 0.9%. That's on a trailing 12-month basis through June, so comparable to our 1.5% price increase. But for the full year both food away from home and food at home are currently projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% each. So what will be interesting we will definitely be looking at those as we move throughout the year and making decisions about what we're going to do with price for the remainder of the year, but as you point out to the extent that food at home continues to be at a significantly lower growth rate the grocery store is a competitor and that does impact the industry's ability to pass on price.\nKathy Martin: Okay. Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer Securities: Thank you. A bright spot in the quarter was the profit growth in Europe. You had a slightly negative comp and you're able to somewhat increase the McOpCo margins there. So can you explain how that's possible? How did that happen? And is that sustainable if we have continued weak flattish type comps over in Europe going forward?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Brian. This is Don. I'm going to ask Tim to make some comments about Europe and productivity. I know he's made quite a few business to the marketplace there relative to what we're doing in McOpCo and how we're focused on our margins there and the profitability and productivity aspects of the business. Tim?\nTim Fenton: Brian, first of all as Pete mentioned the UK and Russia have been two of our best performing countries in Europe which represent almost 50% of our company-operated margins. But in spite of \u2013 along with that, the team has really done a great job of fine-tuning their P&L efficiencies particularly in labor scheduling and food cost controls, so they've done a very good job on scheduling efficiencies and just working those through the P&L, so we're very happy with the progress they've made.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.\nMatt DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. I guess just looking at the guidance and the end of the 8K there, you talk about G&A. It looks like it's a little bit of a change from previous where you were 2% to 3% constant currency growth, now you're flat. I was wondering what came out of that? Is it simply just a lower outlook brings about lower compensation or is there \u2013 some of the technology spend that you did last year that you thought was going to continue at the same pace, have you been able to save money or you're deferring that to '14? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Matt, it's really a combination of factors. Obviously the technology spend we think is an important long-term differentiator for us and a lot of that is in the restaurants. So we're appropriately pacing that. There's other areas that we look at for efficiencies in terms of spending. And then finally as you mentioned, lower performance will yield lower incentive comp and so there's a lower outlook for that as well. So it's a combination of all of those.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Just two quick follow-ups. First, as we look at the European business, seems like economists are getting a little bit more bullish on the European economy and like people are calling for bottoming in the middle of '13 and recovery starting late in '13. So being that you get to service all those markets across Europe, I'm just wondering on the trends you see within the data, how would you size up the pace or do you feel confident, a likelihood of recovery seem like France and Germany would need to improve before perhaps the UK and or Russia slows, I'm just wondering how you'd size it up based on the data you're seeing? And the follow-up is just \u2013 I mean the quality of comments you guys gave for the rest of the \u2013 the remainder of the year being challenged. I'm just wondering because you said fairly. A couple of times I know you mentioned that you still grew revenues, operating income and earnings in the second quarter and in the first quarter as well. I'm just wondering if that's a reasonable assumption for the back half of the year or would that dynamic change? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Hi, Jeff. Just a little bit maybe on the European economy and then as we talk about challenges for the rest of the year. First of the all European economy, I can give you a perspective. All of us travel quite a bit to our markets. I don't know \u2013 the economists may be a bit ahead of themselves. That's my personal perspective but it's based upon the fact that if you look at GDP growth even quarter one versus year ago or even as you roll into quarter two, France is still in a recession two quarters now that we've seen negative GDP growth. We had Germany, which is negative in GDP growth. Spain is still suffering. From an unemployment perspective, you've got much higher unemployment than the norm across Europe. Youth unemployment is something that is somewhat alarming whether it be in France at 26%, Spain at 57%. You've got markets \u2013 I was recently in Portugal and Ireland, you got markets, some markets may have bottomed out. I would tell you some of the larger markets are still having some challenges. So we're looking forward to the bottom out, so to speak, and then a resurgence. At times you'll see a resurgence in some of the markets. Europe for us means 39 different areas and countries that we're working in, but it is a \u2013 it's still a challenged environment. The wonderful thing for us and I call it a wonderful thing because if we weren't focused on having implemented the value platforms when we did about a year ago, we would've lost more traffic. At this stage of the game, we are continuing to gain market share across the majority of European countries and that is the position we wanted to be in. Solidify market share, solidify customer visits, those things then we know lead to \u2013 with business you can get sales, with sales you can get profitability, but you have to have the sales coming in the front door. And so for us right now Europe is still a big challenge. As we look across the rest of the year, the notion \u2013 when we made the comment about challenge, it is similar to the second quarter. So as we see third and fourth quarters, we see them similar to the second quarter where we still see the ability for us to continue to move the business forward, however they are challenging environments, and you know we don\u2019t give guidance but we\u2019re just really being as transparent as we\u2019ve always been relative to what we see in the market places.\nKathy Martin: All right. Next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. My question is on the CapEx guidance revision and I just wonder philosophically why the need to turn the CapEx for this year and you mentioned that you wanted to be conservative with that even though the returns on those investments look good. So, I\u2019m just wondering what is going on, on that line and what you might be seeing that\u2019s giving you a pause there?\nPeter J. Bensen: David, it's really only about 50 openings that we trim from the guidance. So, to your point, new restaurant openings are our highest returning investments and the new openings over the last 12 months are no exception to that, they have generally being performing well. With the exception probably of China where, with the chicken issues in China and the slower economic growth there, that is the biggest of all of the markets contributing to the 50 store decline. So they took a hard look at their inventory, some of the sites they\u2019re pushing off to the future are open. And if you think about our opening cycle there is 12 to 24 months from the time we identify a site until we go to ground break, so that\u2019s a lot of time for the market dynamics to shift around a little bit. So we\u2019re just fine tuning around the edges, some of the inventory and not making any dramatic changes to our outlook for our new restaurant openings or our overall CapEx spend.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham.\nMitch Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much, and considering the U.S. the Company operated margin decline of 110 bips. Can you perhaps try and parse that out between cost pressures and promotional activity?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Mitch. Pricing \u2013 being down 120 basis points in pricing is probably the single biggest contributor to the margin weakness there, but we had pressure across a lot of the lines in the P&L. So without that extra pricing, wage rates, little lower efficiency, we threw a lot of new products at the restaurants this quarter. So our efficiency per crew hour was down a little bit. We had additional depreciation from reimages that continue, and we had the increased additional advertising and promotional cost from the new product. So we had, on the cost side these incremental pressures that were not overcome by a stronger comp.\nKathy Martin: Our next question is from Michael Kelter from Goldman.\nMichael Kelter - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I guess with all respect throughout the economy being tough, ultimately between the focus on value messaging and the new products that you\u2019re saying you\u2019re all hitting targets, realistically it's just not moving the needle for you in this environment. So, I guess my question is; what do you need to do to adjust? Essentially other than the economy getting better, what are you going to do differently to get more people in the doors in the next 6 to 12 months?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Michael, this is Don. First point and I want to reiterate it. We\u2019re winning in the market place. When we look at market share across our major markets, we are gaining market share and that\u2019s an important factor here. So, if you ask what do we need to do to adjust? I think we need to continue to adjust. We\u2019ve been adjusting now for about the last couple of years relative to making sure we had solid value platforms. We\u2019ve ensured that we have a good mix of value and premium based products, so we can gain as much margin as possible. What we don\u2019t have and Pete just mentioned it, is we don\u2019t have as much pricing power. And as long as inflationary rates are lower and as long as GDP growth and consumer discretionary spending is softer we\u2019re not going to move forward and take a lot of price because we know that it would mean guest count erosion longer term. So we\u2019ll be mindful of the price increases that we take. We\u2019ll continue to make sure that our value platforms are installed and strong. We\u2019ll make sure that we have a very solid menu pipeline which has helped us to as you see in the U.S. to outperform the competition in mass, and so when we look at what we\u2019re doing now, we think those are the right things to do. Pete mentioned growing the business and developing new sites. Our new sites are performing relatively well and so we\u2019re going to continue to invest capital there. The returns on reimage sites when you have less comparable sales that gets a little bit tight and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that, to Pete\u2019s point is we always do from a financially responsible perspective, but good pipelines, good value, good marketing campaigns, those things will continue. As I mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to invest in technology and we think we do still have some room to grow relative to some of the things we can offer our consumers from an engagement perspective there, and we\u2019ll continue to make sure we have good marketing spend, good awareness relative to our advertising. So, we\u2019re going to continue doing those things and implement those solidly. We\u2019ll continue focusing on the growth strategies we\u2019ve talked about. There is room to grow in beverages, and in chicken, and in breakfast, and we\u2019re moving breakfast around the globe. So all of these pieces are the things that for us we still have a lot of work to do at McDonald\u2019s and we\u2019ll continue to focus on those areas.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Advisors: Don, I just want to get a better read on your view of the U.S. consumer. It looks like obviously both quick service and casual dining consumers in the U.S. are pulling back on spending pretty dramatically in June and July. So from what you\u2019re seeing with your own customers, what are some of the key economic drivers on the more conservative behavior and what I mean is just more specially the last couple of months, it seems like a line has been drawn in the sand, consumers have definitely stayed away from pretty much all forms of restaurants or at least cut down on their occasions, I mean again just curious what your view is on what's going on?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Jeff, a great question and the way you positioned it is accurate as we\u2019ve seen it. We have not drawn a direct correlation as if yet, the sequestration or other I\u2019ll say tactical executions that have occurred in the U.S. what we do know is that there was a pullback to some extent, and it does seem to be impacting the informal eating out industry a little bit more or so than broader retail. So, again what we have to do is make sure that we institute and continue to have solid value and we have to do that by balancing and also with some innovative new news, this is going to be absolutely critical for us as we move forward. We have to continue to invest in the business appropriately, but make sure we\u2019re mindful of the returns. I don\u2019t foresee this changing in the next couple of months which is why we spoke of the rest of the year being challenging. And what we see in the United States is not unlike what we see in some of the other markets that are out there. Having said that, we feel pretty solid about the fact that we can continue to gain market share and that our focus. And if we can do that, we\u2019ll gain additional guest counts, we\u2019ll gain additional sales and we\u2019ll gain additional profitability. The pricing piece that Pete mentioned again is going to be tougher through the rest of the year in terms of taking price. So, we\u2019ll be monitoring that and measuring that relative to our margins. But again the market place itself is a little bit -- it is a little bit tighter than we\u2019ve seen. But one thing we\u2019ve never done at McDonald\u2019s, we don\u2019t cry or whine over market conditions, because all of us are in the same market conditions. So we just have to stay focused on what we do best which is move the business in the way as we\u2019ve discussed today.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from Andy Barish, Jefferies.\nAndy Barish - Jefferies: Hey, guys, one quick follow-up and then one new area. Just in terms of the monopoly shift does that open up the October window for a new product platform potentially here, and then just on the new front, on franchise margins they continue to slip a little bit; is that purely a function of getting comp back into solidly positive territory to see return or should we expect some of the higher D&A and occupancy to continue to weigh at least near term on franchise margins?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Andy I\u2019m going to let Tim make a comment relative to monopoly. I think he\u2019ll make a pretty solid point about whether or not it opens up another opportunity, clearly we can speak to specifics but he just finished one of the reviews with the U.S. business, so he can give you a couple of headlines as to some of the things I discussed. Relative to franchise margins we\u2019ll have Pete make a comment on that after Tim.\nTim Fenton: Okay, well Andy I can\u2019t say specifically on what products we have coming in, but we have a pretty robust fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter coming down the pike. And as far as monopoly we moved it in as everyone has stated already and really take advantage of the food traffic that we do have in our third quarter. So, product\u2019s coming, can\u2019t get specific on it.\nPeter J. Bensen: Andy, you point out the franchise margins they are compared in the capital margins. They're even more sensitive to the comp because the base of cost is more fixed. So the depreciation and the rents are really \u2013 we really need a stronger comp to start to get that percentage to move upwards.\nDon Thompson: Andy too, and I know we've talked about this and we've tried to relate on the call, the new products that we've implemented have resonated with consumers. And I want to make sure that everyone understands that IEO is relatively flat and declining in many of the markets around the world. So we're not going to change that menu pipeline execution strategy. It is absolutely working. However, we are facing some headwinds and so we'll continue to execute that, continue to make our target to outperform in the marketplace as a whole. But I think you are quite clairvoyant to the fact that there may be something that does come up in the latter part of the year relative to new products.\nKathy Martin: All right. Next question is from Bryan Elliot, Raymond James.\nBryan Elliot - Raymond James: Thank you. I'd like to talk about competitive environment outside of the U.S. So the informal eating out market particularly in Europe has been soft for some time. Are you seeing evidence yet of some shrinkage in supply and also thinking about China, which has been through a meaningful short-term contraction, if there's been any shakeout of competition, particularly thinking of maybe of local type, non-deep pocket type competition and if you're seeing any benefit potentially down the road from some of that?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Bryan. Outside of the U.S., some of the competitive sets are different. I'll ask Tim to speak a little bit to some of the things that he's seeing out there. But keep this in mind. The U.S. is \u2013 there are a couple of markets that are similar to the U.S. and not quite to the U.S. level relative to the competitive density of competitors as we know them. In many of these cases you have more as we would define them smaller chains, mom and pop type organizations. So we do see consolidation in some of those smaller ones when you get into recessionary periods or macroeconomic conditions like these, but relative to whether or not we've seen larger chains that are consolidating that's not something that I have seen. But Tim, I don't know what else we've seen out there in your travels.\nTim Fenton: Bryan, a lot of couponing and vouchering going on, but we're seeing a rise in the non-traditional competitors that we've faced in the past, particularly cafes, convenience stores, bakeries and supermarkets coming up with ready-to-eat meals. So that's been a resurgence for them, particularly in Europe. On China, the overall chicken market is kind of taking a step backwards as it pertains to the IEO. It's starting to dissipate now and coming back but particularly I would say in Western QSR has probably taken the biggest decline.\nKathy Martin: All right. Our next question's from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. It seemed in the last release, in the April release and on that conference call, you were a little bit more protective about profitability in the U.S. and I wonder if there is a change if I'm right in sensing that, there is a change relative \u2013 how we're thinking about the business now? And of course I ask that in the context of the franchisees, which I think make more money per store level than \u2013 I know make more money per store level than any other major franchisee group if they've really signed on to I think what you're asking them is less pricing, continue with the Dollar Menu, focus on driving traffic even if it doesn't necessarily come to an extent of increasing their near-term store level cash flow?\nDon Thompson: Hi, John. Thanks for the question. I would tell you the franchisees have done I think a stellar job in this environment and if you think about it from their perspective, several things. One is they've definitely been aligned relative to the things that we have asked of them focusing on the customer, ensuring that we continue to invest in the business, whether it be reimages or whether it be with new products and the new product introductions. We have really accelerated some of those introductions and getting those to the marketplace because it's very important to have new news and exciting news as well as to execute value. They have been very, very aligned on the value campaign and platform. Having said that, they've given a lot of feedback relative to what does the Dollar Menu look like today and how we need to maintain that and what things we might need to look at in terms of any modifications at any point in time. So I think the franchisees have done a really, really solid job. They've continued to invest in the business and we along with them in the business, they are one of the greatest assets to this overall McDonald's family has. I'd also add along with that, our suppliers because they are in an interesting commodity and legislative environment as well as the franchisees and small business owners. And they also have supported our system relative to how we want to be able to manage through these macroeconomic issues around the world. And so I can't say anything but be complementary about what our franchisees have done relative to the cash flow investments, their focus on the business, their focus on the customers, their focus on their employees and they're focused on a broader alignment around the McDonald system.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar.\nR.J. Hottovy - Morningstar Research: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to keep it in the U.S. for a minute. You talked about the new products, innovations meeting or exceeding expectations. I was hoping to get some color on the Dollar Menu, just in particular your thoughts about the recent Dollar Menu performance and how that compares to your expectations especially with so much promotional activity in the environment? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Hi, R.J. The Dollar Menu itself still represents about 13% to 14% of sales, which is still in that same range it's been in. What has benefited us has been the fact that it is a consistent execution and it still has tremendous alignment across the franchises and the McOpCo restaurants that we have. So it is the value platform of choice. Now we've done a couple of things to try to add some new news to that which also help us to be a little bit more margin accretive, things like the Grilled Onion Cheddar Sandwich, Hot 'n Spicy McChicken limited time offer selections that we placed into the Dollar Menu. Even having done those, we still remain at 13% to 14% of sales based upon the Dollar Menu. So it is a solid platform for us. The last thing I'll mention is, early on we talked about the fact that there are \u2013 Tim mentioned we see a lot of discounting in the broader marketplace. We know that one of the most important things that customers look for is consistency in terms of the value platform. They want to know that they can depend on McDonald's to continue to deliver value every day all day and the platform for us is more than about short-term discounts. It's about establishing customer loyalty versus being aggressive for one or two months. We need long-term loyalty. We want a strong customer base. We want to make sure we drive business frequency and we want to support the introduction also of higher margin products, so build the base so that when we implement new products, those products have more awareness relative to our consumer base. So we've established these branded affordability platforms around the world now and they are performing to the levels that we would like. We have a couple of markets, R.J., that we still need to do a little bit of work and Tim is focused on some of those markets. But by and large, we're in a pretty solid place relative to the value platforms around the world.\nKathy Martin: Next question is Peter Saleh from Telsey Advisor Group.\nPeter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great, thank you. I know it's still early but maybe you could give us a little bit of a preview on your outlook for commodities for 2014. We've seen the grain prices coming down and I remember last summer, we had gain prices really shooting up because of the drought and your team in the U.S. at least was able to do a pretty good job in terms of your exposure for this year. So any thoughts on '14 would be pretty helpful?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Peter, it's premature for us to give any numerical guidance but you can imagine as you point out that our team is constantly looking at how do we best deliver that stable, predictable price to the restaurants. While we're not trying to be market timers, we obviously do look at the markets to see when conditions might be better to layer on some coverage and you can imagine that we are working with our suppliers and our suppliers are putting hedges on, going into next year to provide us some of that stability. Probably at the Analyst Meeting in November it's when we'll start to give some numerical texture on 2014.\nKathy Martin: Your next question is Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. You've talked about new news and I\u2019m wondering if it's fair to kind of assess that as evolutions of current platforms and I am asking because it seemed like you bought a lot of customization of these platforms to the menu and I\u2019m wondering how you feel about that being a key driver of sales and profits versus your peer group?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Nicole. I think you see both. You'll see some areas that are customization, if you would, and I assume you're talking about things like the Quarter Pounder line, which will also see some new platforms like you\u2019re seeing with McWraps. You will see us also do limited time offers. So relative to beverages or whether it be the other products that we\u2019d implement. I think Tim gave some insight as to other thing that we might see in the U.S., but this is consistent also Tim around the world.\nTim Fenton: Yeah and in the U.S. Egg White Delight being able to put that different muffins and different carriers. But as we move into the platform deployment of made for you, you\u2019re seeing more customization.\nKathy Martin: All right. We have time for one last question. Paul Westra from Stifel.\nPaul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Inc.: Great. Thank you. I was wondering if we get an update on the value menu efforts in France, particularly maybe Australia a bit. I know you [indiscernible] menu there and given a softness economically, I was curious to give as much color as we can about the mix, the value effort there and may be the percentage of add-on sales within that menu that helps pay for it, is that progressing as planned? And I guess a related question to the loose menu effort in Australia. I\u2019m just somewhat surprised about the overall comp going negative with the great success of the loose menu, seems would have prepared you well for this year\u2019s economic softness, and curious maybe about market share changes in Australia as well?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Paul. I will \u2013 I can speak to the end of that with Australian market share changes and then I will ask Tim to talk about the other part of your question, which was France and France\u2019s value piece. Relative to Australia, Australia is another one of those markets that at this point in time we see from their perspective you\u2019re seeing some softer \u2013 clearly a softer economy, youth unemployment in Australia is about 25.5%. So they\u2019re facing some thing, unemployment for them has risen. Having said that, Australia is also one of the markets that we\u2019ve had some solid share gains in and continue to have share gains in Australia. The \u2013 so the broader marketplace we\u2019ve seen some \u2013 we see some tough economy, but we\u2019ve also seen some share gain and we\u2019ve seen our business meeting forward there. And again, I think the franchisees and the folks, the Company employees and suppliers have done a good job there. So, Tim anything on France?\nTim Fenton: Yeah Paul, France if you remember us talking about Casse-Croute, which is a Baguette Sandwich and a drink for under \u20ac5 has done extremely well for us, particularly in the lunch day part. France is gaining market share in a declining IEO environment. The thing that we\u2019re working on to address is looking at some erosion at the dinner time and the folks have done a really good job of putting some products in test to address that, but it\u2019s a tough environment there. They\u2019re gaining share at the expense of the rest of the IEO players.\nKathy Martin: All right. Thanks everyone. We got some final remarks from Don.\nDon Thompson: First of all, thank you all again for being on today\u2019s call and participating. And as we wrap up the call, I want to make sure that you all understand that while we recognize that this is a challenging environment, we\u2019ve been through challenging environments before as McDonald\u2019s. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages of our system, truly are strength and a reflection of our ability to build on and learn from the past, having went through cycles before, these are different when you see them in the broad nature of these around the globe. But we\u2019ve been purposeful and we\u2019ve been agile, very flexible in our local markets about how we address some of the challenges there. We are going to be and continue to be strategic relative to the way that we plan and evolve based upon customers spending habits, their discretionary opportunities, and the fact that we want to be their favorite place and wait to eat. So we look to evolving with our customers, evolving in these marketplaces and leveraging our history to make sure we mitigate through these challenges. Thanks so much for all of your support and your questions and have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s call.

Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton will join us for Q&A. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast.

Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Despite mixed first quarter performance, McDonald's remains a daily destination for our 69 million customers around the world. The talented teams leading our business in 119 markets around the world continue to leverage their deep experience in a variety of operating environment. Our strong system alignment has enabled us to remain focused on serving great tasting food and beverages in contemporary restaurants and at an affordable price because that's what matters most to our customers. These strengths combined with our diverse portfolio in terms of geography, menu and across day parts, enable us to build for the future while we remain focused on delivering in the short-term. The challenging economic environment in which we're operating impacted our first quarter results. While there are mixed signs of a slow recovery in the U.S., significant headwinds persist as consumer confidence continues to waver. Persistently high unemployment rates and ongoing austerity measures in Europe and soft macroeconomic conditions in APMEA are pressuring consumer purchasing power as well. And the informal eating out industry is either flat or declining in many markets around the world. Year-to-date March, our global comparable sales were down 1%. This reflects comparisons against strong prior year results that include an additional day due to leap year and last year\u2019s favorable weather. Operating income was flat in constant currencies and EPS was $1.26, a 3% increase in constant currencies. While not unexpected, we are not satisfied with our first quarter results. Even though our top line comparables will ease through the remainder of the year, macroeconomic pressures will continue, and we\u2019ve also seen new challenges emerge in the marketplace like softer retail sales in the U.S. and the avian influenza outbreak in Asia. So as we begin the second quarter, April global comparable sales are expected to be slightly negative. However, I am confident that we have the right plans in place to strengthen our business momentum for the long-term. We know we can\u2019t control the external environment in which we\u2019re operating, but we can leverage our scale and strength to aggressively pursue opportunities within our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience, and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s around the world. As I share an update on our performance by geography, I\u2019ll provide examples that illustrate how local markets are executing their plans within the framework of our plan to win and these three global growth priorities. You\u2019ll also see in some cases that we continue to make adjustments to generate the greatest impact in the current environment and drive long-term growth. Let\u2019s start with the U.S. where comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.2%, amidst the challenging eating out environment and operating income declined 3%. While our comparable sales were negative, we outperformed the competitive set and increased market share. This reflects our ability to continue differentiating our brand despite declines in IEO category. We continue to compliment Dollar Menu value news with a focus on core favorites and innovative new products. In addition to our annual focus on Filet-O-Fish during the Lenten season, we expanded the McBites platform to include Fish McBites. Throughout the year, we will feature even more compelling new products in the United States especially in our four key growth categories of chicken, premium beef, breakfast and beverages. For example, Premium McWraps, a great innovation from Europe that we\u2019ve begun to scale globally; Egg White Delight, a tasty lower calorie addition to our breakfast line-up and Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothies which originated in Canada are three delicious new additions that position us to continue growing sales and market share in the second quarter. In Europe, comparable sales were down 1.1% for the quarter and operating income was up 1% in constant currencies. Results in Germany and France remain soft, while the UK and Russia continue to deliver. Across the region, we\u2019re focused on building market share by reinforcing our value platform to offer compelling affordable products across all day parts and multiple price tiers. We build on that foundation by featuring premium products and promotions that encourage trade up and higher average check. France launched Casse-Croute sandwich and drink combo for \u20ac4.50. It drove strong performance during the lunch day part by enabling us to compete with local bakeries through an appealing offer below the \u20ac5.00 price point. In Germany, the \u20ac1.00 beef or chicken western burgers complemented (inaudible) and Stars of America promotional food events to contribute to results. Germany continues to refine its value offers across day parts in an effort to strengthen value perceptions for consumers who remain price sensitive in this challenging economic environment. And in the UK, successful food events featuring premium products continued to resonate with our customers in this largely reimage marketplace. This past quarter promotions included the limited addition, Deli Choices, featuring the Cajun Crispy Chicken Sandwich. We also launched Chicken McBites in January as part of the UK tasters\u2019 menu. This limited time offer further validates the global appeal of this great product outside of Australia and the United States. Russia also continues to deliver solid results with its focus on breakfast and seasonal menu offerings that emphasize local taste, including spicy wraps and spicy rolls. While both the UK and Russia posted positive comparable sales for the first quarter and continued to grow market share, momentum in both markets has slowed relative to strong results in 2012. This is the effect of weaken consumer confidence in the UK and lower levels of inflation in Russia that limit our pricing power. Now, let\u2019s shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, where comparable sales were down 3.3% for the quarter, while operating income increased 2% in constant currencies. We remain focused on aggressively driving top line performance and growing market share through continued emphasis on our value platforms by accelerating growth at breakfast and by enhancing service and convenience initiatives. Breakfast remains a significant growth opportunity for us in APMEA. Today, a large percentage of the Asian population eats breakfast away from home. But our breakfast sales as a percentage of full day sales are only 11%. That\u2019s less than half the U.S. average of 25%, which tells us the breakfast represents a significant growth opportunity in this region. As part of a year long focus to get more consumers to think of McDonald's as a morning destination, 30 countries across APMEA participated in a National Breakfast Day promotion on March 18. 5,000 restaurants gave away 5 million of our great tasting and nutritious Egg McMuffins, and we significantly increased awareness and trial for our breakfast products. Let\u2019s turn to APMEA\u2019s big three markets starting with Australia. Our focused efforts to balance value initiatives with promotional activities that encourage trade-up, positively contributed to first quarter results. Monopoly, which returned to Australia after a 13-year hiatus, drove Extra Value Meal sales and encouraged add-on purchases with game pieces strategically placed on drinks, fries, and deserts. Japan\u2019s performance for the quarter was negatively impacted by the difficult economy, a declining IEO industry, and ongoing consumer sensitivity to prices and promotions. Japan continues to evaluate and adjust its plans to complement existing value initiatives with new product news that drives long-term profitable sales and guest counts. For example, January\u2019s national Big Mac campaign resonated well with customers and was another step in our journey to rebalance our core menu pricing and promotion strategies. In China, comparable sales decreased 4.6% for the quarter in part due to the residual effects of consumer sensitivity around the supply chain issue in the chicken industry. Even though our supply chain was not implicated. A diverse menu across multiple day parts, menu offerings, and price tiers enables us to offer a broad variety of affordable choices, which is especially critical in the current environment across Asia. During the quarter, limited time offers, including the Mashed Potato Beef Burger and the Sausage Double Beef Burger positively contributed to performance. We\u2019re also complementing our new-menu news in China with meaningful efforts to make McDonald's even more accessible to our customers. We continue to strategically add new restaurants with a focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where we\u2019re best able to effectively leverage our scale and our marketing strength. Throughout APMEA, we are expanding our presence by building on the potential that exist in our brand extensions, especially delivery, kiosk, mid-caf\u00e9, and drive-through. As of March, about 50% of our restaurants are opened 24 hours and almost 20% offer delivery service to our customers. As we continue to build on our firm foundation in every area of the world, our commitment to financial discipline has not wavered. We have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry, and a robust business that generated $7 billion in cash from operations last year. Our philosophy regarding the use of cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business to capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. These include strategically developing new restaurants in certain markets, modernizing our restaurants, so they\u2019re move relevant and appealing to our customers, and investing in initiatives like multiple order points or mobile ordering that increase the capacity and the convenience of our existing restaurant. After reinvesting in the business, our second use of cash is our dividend. Our third and final use of cash is share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In closing, we recognize the challenges inherent in the macroeconomic environment and do not expect to see any significant improvements in the short-term. And while comparisons will ease as we move through the year, it is not likely that the global IEO industry will improve dramatically. This will continue to pressure our performance. Now more than ever, we remain focused on those areas within our control to grow market share and drive future performance. We know what we need to do and we are determined to keep getting better and sharing ideas, scaling proven successes and moving even more quickly to bring winning solutions to markets around the world. I remain confident in our business. Our system alignment, our strategies, the actions we are taking position us well to successfully navigate this environment in the near-term while profitably managing the business for the long-term. Thank you and with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pete.\nPeter J. Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The pursuit of long-term profitable growth permeates the McDonald\u2019s system and guides our actions from the way we staff our restaurants, to the investments we make in infrastructure and technology to build capacity, to the strategic decisions we make around menu offerings, pricing and promotions.\n, : For now, it is the market share battle and we are determined to continue making the necessary adjustments to maintain and grow our share, because that is how we will win over the long-term. There is no single solution for driving sustained growth in value creation; rather we are pushing forward on multiple fronts, guided by the three global growth priorities under our plan to win. The adjustments are beginning to take hold. In the first quarter, we outperformed the IEO industry in several key markets, including the U.S. as Don noted earlier. With 81% of our global restaurants franchise, our profitability is driven primarily by top line sales. The total system life sales increased 2% in constant currencies, persistent expense pressures and negative comparable sales contributed to a 50 basis point decline in first quarter combined operating margin to 29.5%. The largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which rose $25 million to nearly $1.8 billion, a 2% constant currency increase. Consolidated franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points to 81.7% due to higher cost and negative comparable sales. Global company-operated margin dollars declined $58 million to $719 million for the quarter, a 7% decrease in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 130 basis points to 16.2% as average check growth was more than offset by higher labor, occupancy, and other operating costs. We expect margins to continue to be pressured throughout 2013, though margin decline to be less pronounced as sales comparison ease in upcoming quarters. In the U.S., company operating margins declined 140 basis points to 17.4% primarily due to higher labor and other operating expenses. First quarter commodity costs were relatively flat. We expect increased cost pressure the rest of the year with a full-year increase in our U.S. grocery basket expected to be 1.5% to 2.5%. In terms of pricing, the U.S. entered the first quarter at about 1.5%. during the quarter, we\u2019ve replaced about half of the 120 basis points of prior year price increases that rolled off. We will continue to closely manage our pricing decisions to maintain our value proposition as we strive to grow traffic and market share. For the full-year, food away from home is projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5%, while food at home inflation is projected to be about 50 basis points higher. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, food away from home was up 2.3%, while food at home was up only 1%. Turning to Europe, company-operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 16.7% due to higher labor and commodity costs and increased depreciation related to reimaging. The UK and Russia together account for almost half of Europe\u2019s total company-operated margin dollars. Europe\u2019s grocery bill was up about 2.5% in the quarter. We expect a similar increase in second quarter with the full-year increase now projected to be 2.5% to 3.5%, slightly lower than our estimate in January. Across Europe, the average price increase at the end of first quarter excluding Russia was about 1.5%. The sluggish macro economic environment coupled with the soft IEO market will limit our pricing power for the balance of the year. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins declined 230 basis points to 14.6% due to the acceleration of new restaurant openings mainly in China along with higher labor, occupancy, and other costs throughout the segment. There is a heightened scrutiny around the quality of new store openings, ensuring that we are doing everything we can to optimize new store margins in this key growth segment. G&A for the quarter increased modestly and was in line with our expectations. We are on track for full year G&A to increase about 2% to 3% in constant currencies, so there will be some variability between quarters. As indicated in January, the first quarter included a non-recurring tax benefit of nearly $50 million resulting in a tax rate of 30%. Our full year guidance remains at 31% to 33%, which implies the effective tax rate will likely be at the higher end of this range in subsequent quarters. We remain committed to generating strong returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to growth, driving sales increases at existing restaurants and adding profitable new units. We continue to exercise discipline as we allocate capital and make steady progress toward our global growth priority of modernizing the customer experience through our reimaging efforts. We expect to reimage more than 1,600 restaurants this year, including about 800 in the U.S., 450 in Europe, and 225 in APMEA. Through first quarter we have completed about 250 reimages globally. In addition, we expect to complete about 200 rebuilds in the U.S. this year. Opening new units is part of our global growth priority to broaden accessibility to our brand. We focus on strategically growing at select number of markets to have a significant potential and can generate attractive returns over the long-term. We are on track to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 an affiliated and developmental license markets. Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.01. At current rates which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally impacted with a full-year negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02. As you know, this is directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout 2013. The external challenges we face in 2013 are in many ways similar to last year, low consumer confidence in shrinking disposable income negatively impacting consumer demand coupled with continued pressure across many expense categories. We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments to fortify our near-term performance and we remain diligent about monitoring the environment and making further adjustments as we move throughout the year. I\u2019m confident in the future of our great brand. McDonald's has increasingly modern restaurants in outstanding locations around the world. Best-in-class franchisees and suppliers and dedicated company employees, all aligned to drive long-term enduring profitable growth for our system and shareholders. Thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\n : For now, it is the market share battle and we are determined to continue making the necessary adjustments to maintain and grow our share, because that is how we will win over the long-term. There is no single solution for driving sustained growth in value creation; rather we are pushing forward on multiple fronts, guided by the three global growth priorities under our plan to win.

In the U.S., company operating margins declined 140 basis points to 17.4% primarily due to higher labor and other operating expenses. First quarter commodity costs were relatively flat.

In terms of pricing, the U.S. entered the first quarter at about 1.5%. during the quarter, we\u2019ve replaced about half of the 120 basis points of prior year price increases that rolled off.

For the full-year, food away from home is projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5%, while food at home inflation is projected to be about 50 basis points higher. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, food away from home was up 2.3%, while food at home was up only 1%. Turning to Europe, company-operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 16.7% due to higher labor and commodity costs and increased depreciation related to reimaging. The UK and Russia together account for almost half of Europe\u2019s total company-operated margin dollars. Europe\u2019s grocery bill was up about 2.5% in the quarter. We expect a similar increase in second quarter with the full-year increase now projected to be 2.5% to 3.5%, slightly lower than our estimate in January. Across Europe, the average price increase at the end of first quarter excluding Russia was about 1.5%. The sluggish macro economic environment coupled with the soft IEO market will limit our pricing power for the balance of the year. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins declined 230 basis points to 14.6% due to the acceleration of new restaurant openings mainly in China along with higher labor, occupancy, and other costs throughout the segment. There is a heightened scrutiny around the quality of new store openings, ensuring that we are doing everything we can to optimize new store margins in this key growth segment. G&A for the quarter increased modestly and was in line with our expectations. We are on track for full year G&A to increase about 2% to 3% in constant currencies, so there will be some variability between quarters. As indicated in January, the first quarter included a non-recurring tax benefit of nearly $50 million resulting in a tax rate of 30%. Our full year guidance remains at 31% to 33%, which implies the effective tax rate will likely be at the higher end of this range in subsequent quarters. We remain committed to generating strong returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to growth, driving sales increases at existing restaurants and adding profitable new units. We continue to exercise discipline as we allocate capital and make steady progress toward our global growth priority of modernizing the customer experience through our reimaging efforts. We expect to reimage more than 1,600 restaurants this year, including about 800 in the U.S., 450 in Europe, and 225 in APMEA. Through first quarter we have completed about 250 reimages globally. In addition, we expect to complete about 200 rebuilds in the U.S. this year. Opening new units is part of our global growth priority to broaden accessibility to our brand. We focus on strategically growing at select number of markets to have a significant potential and can generate attractive returns over the long-term. We are on track to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 an affiliated and developmental license markets. Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.01. At current rates which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally impacted with a full-year negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02. As you know, this is directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout 2013. The external challenges we face in 2013 are in many ways similar to last year, low consumer confidence in shrinking disposable income negatively impacting consumer demand coupled with continued pressure across many expense categories. We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments to fortify our near-term performance and we remain diligent about monitoring the environment and making further adjustments as we move throughout the year. I\u2019m confident in the future of our great brand. McDonald's has increasingly modern restaurants in outstanding locations around the world. Best-in-class franchisees and suppliers and dedicated company employees, all aligned to drive long-term enduring profitable growth for our system and shareholders. Thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nChris Stent: Thanks, Pete. I will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from David Palmer of UBS.\nDavid S. Palmer \u2013 UBS Securities LLC:\n :\nDon Thompson: Hi, David and good morning to you. There are several different points, I guess, in your question there. First of all, what have we done in Europe? Last year, we began to talk about a couple of the markets that we felt we needed to have additional focus on, those markets in being France and Germany. We talked about the fact that the southern division of Europe was really going through tough macroeconomies and that remains the same today. However, what we have done is, in the market of France, we have changed and fortified our value offerings. We talked about Casse-Croute this morning. They solidified Petit Plaisirs. They\u2019ve done several things and that's why we\u2019re gaining share in France. If you look at the southern division, the southern division as a market, which includes Spain and Italy, and Portugal, those markets are also gaining share. So we have been performing \u2013 we\u2019re performing well relative to the overall marketplace. However, it is very soft consumer confidence there. Relative to refranchising, what we have continued to do as we always do is look at our overall company-operated portfolio and determine whether or not we have opportunities to continue to improve that first or we have opportunities in terms of leveraging G&A, leveraging scale, improving overall operational efficiency by refranchising. We have one market; we continue to look at some of that in, which is the UK. But the other markets, we feel fairly good about the way that the portfolio is stacked up at this point in time.\nChris Stent: Okay. Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph T. Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Can you talk about your comments like gaining share in the first quarter, particularly the U.S., what you think the gap between your comp number and the QSR sector might have been? And then extend that into April, I guess, the April sales commentary is a little bit more surprising given the easier comparison. So could you talk about factors that you think are influencing the April sales number?\nDon Thompson: All right, Joe. I think we\u2019ll talk probably a couple of different things. One, it will be from a U.S. perspective and the other is really a global perspective. In the U.S., if you look at our comparisons to the overall competitive set, we\u2019ve outperformed the competition by about 1.4%. That's the comp gap. And so we and that\u2019s the overall competitive set. So we feel, again, that the things that we have begun to do to bring energy to the marketplace in both food and value. They are solidified, they are in place. Having said that, and we normally don\u2019t talk about weather at all, but we know in the month of April, last quarter \u2013 the first quarter of last year, we saw very favorable weather. Matter of fact, it was the best weather that we had seen in 118 years, the first quarter, through March of last year. This year what we\u2019re seeing in the month of or the first quarter was some tough weather. We also in April, clearly, we\u2019re seeing some differences in weather. So we have to be cognizant of that. We won\u2019t use weather as an excuse because next year we don\u2019t want to use it, we\u2019re going to be comping up against it. But the reality of it is we have seen some things in weather that are there. We still feel like from a competitive set, we\u2019re going to perform well and our marketing plans and our food \u2013 and food promotions actually are really solid. We have brought better food news and stronger value to the marketplace.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse.\nKeith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Thanks. Just a follow-up on that question a little bit, thinking through the headline global April outlook, and how some of these issues in China and other parts of Asia might be factoring in. I mean, there\u2019s a big information kind of vacuum right now about what\u2019s actually going on in China with chicken and other counties that might be really influencing that. If you could talk a little bit about what might you actually be seeing there and how that plays into the preliminary global April outlook? That would be very helpful. Thank you.\nDon Thompson: All right, Keith. I\u2019m going to ask Tim Fenton to talk a little bit about China, because as we talk about global, our overall global sales in terms of April, there are somethings that have been emerging pieces that we\u2019ve seen that we had not seen before. One of those is avian influenza and I\u2019ll ask Tim to kind to give a little update on that and maybe even talk just a little bit about. We\u2019re coming out of one thing, which was the chicken industry and issues around antibiotics, and now we have a different piece, which is broader in impact, which is avian influenza. And so that does bear on our global sales as we look forward into April. So, Tim, if you would?\nTim Fenton:  Sure, Keith, good morning. Yes, on China, as we stated, we had a sales decline of 4.6% in the first quarter, going up against a tough first quarter last year as far as high comp, but definitely we saw a switch out of chicken consumption. Fortunately, we do have other proteins that we were able to shift people into, but as we were coming out of it and gaining some traction, obviously, came the avian influenza, which we\u2019ve been there before unfortunately and it not only has had an impact on China, it does have a potential impact on a lot of APMEA, not just China. But again, we continue to move on the different proteins that we have with beef and fish, and as course breakfast in McCafe, but we\u2019re moving with it. We\u2019re doing what we have. We\u2019re continuing to look at what we do in the restaurants from a food safety and with our suppliers, and we\u2019ve been there before, and we\u2019ll continue to move forward with our plan.\nChris Stent: Next question, Matt DiFrisco of Lazard.\nMatt J. DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets LLC:  Thank you. I guess, just touching on some of those food promotions, Don, you were talking about earlier, relative to prior years, I guess, a lot of people have looked at in the success of your beverage product, it had multiple years and sustainability and the impressiveness of lapping big comps and putting up big comps on top of that. Are you seeing the same, I guess, in this environment of more food promotional, it seems like they are a little bit more of an LTO-ish type environment or a sense that you\u2019re not maybe holding the comp as much are they. Are you happy with that as far as how long you are \u2013 that you\u2019re holding the lift from those new introductions such as the Fish Bites and some of the Premium Chicken Wraps?\nDon Thompson: Matt, great question. I think two different parts here, one is the LTO strategy and the other is those things that might become platforms and continue to be part of our course. So if you look at McWraps, McWraps for us is not a limited time offer promotion, it is one of those things that will be a platform for McDonald's as we move forward. It\u2019s been that way in Europe and performed well. We are, we feel that the performance at these early stages in the U.S. has met the expectations that we have and so we are feeling fairly good about that. I continue to say, and I hedge a little bit on my comments about, we continue to feel great about it because let\u2019s keep in mind, we\u2019re still facing a slow recovery in United States from an overall economic perspective. And as we look across Europe, we still have high unemployment rates and higher austerity measures, but in the U.S. that is a platform. Something a little different Fish McBites, that\u2019s a limited time offer, so we\u2019ll have that come in and go out. When you talk about beverages, we will continue to post in beverage products that remind our customers of the overall beverage line up. So when we say blueberry-pomegranate as a smoothie flavor, we\u2019re also saying that we\u2019re going to remind customers of pineapple-mango and strawberry-banana. So we\u2019ll continue to do that and do it more aggressively this year than we did last year.\nChris Stent:  Next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: So your restaurant level margins now appear to be on pace for their third straight year of declines in all three divisions in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia. And so I guess there are two parts to my question on that point. The first is, what are the specific things you are doing to turn that around or is it really just waiting for same-store sales to get better? And second, how the franchisees reacted to declining profit margins at the restaurants?\nPeter J. Bensen:  Michael, it\u2019s Pete. As we\u2018ve always talked that for us margins are much more of a top line gain. So driving comps is critical to driving those margins. And in this environment where you continue to have the cost pressures, so commodities will be up, labor rates are going up et cetera, and yet you have soft economics declining to flat eating-out markets, that battle for market share becomes so critical to the long-term health of the business that we\u2019re willing to sacrifice a little bit of margin to maintain that traffic and grow the market share. So in this environment, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to go after that, and around the world, we\u2019re generally aligned with our franchisees around that. They understand the importance of driving traffic in this environment and taking market share, because again, if the industry isn\u2019t growing, taking market share means we\u2019re taking guests from other restaurants. And in that environment, that is what we have to do to continue to win. Would we love higher margin? Yes. Would they love higher cash flow? Yes, but in this environment, guest count growth and market share growth are critical.\nChris Stent:  Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn S. Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Pete, just, and as you think about last year and this year to the point that it\u2019s a tougher environment, earnings growth is slower, margins are under pressure. One of the things you have is a balance sheet that\u2019s historically been very strong in the cash flow, which you\u2019re using, but can you just reexamine what are the likelihood of you using this very low rate environment to increase leverage maybe without even changing your credit metrics, in other words, maybe the rates are just low enough that you\u2019re going to add debt without changing your interest expense? And secondarily, can you talk about maybe rethinking with the credit metrics you look at or the appropriate given this environment, maybe you\u2019d like to extend that. If you could just maybe help us understand what is the credit metric you look and you manage to and then secondarily, if you\u2019re willing to reexamine that?\nPeter J. Bensen: John, that\u2019s a great question. One of the things we\u2019ve always talked about is the importance of maintaining our A credit rating. So you aren\u2019t going to get into the specific measures that underlie that, but as we look at our role at the franchise or that financial strength is critical for us and you\u2019re aware of our business model being co-invested with our franchisees and part of that three legged stool is a critical piece for us. So that credit rating is important and we feel the alignment created by maintaining that strong credit rating in our financial health is more valuable to shareholders than some kind of one-time leverage event would be. That being said, as you\u2019ve noticed each of the last few years, we continue to augment our free cash flow return to shareholders by increasing the debt on our balance sheet. And we will continue to do that again this year, but my guess is that it\u2019ll probably be at a level below what we added last year.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on all the margin commentary and the pressures that you\u2019re seeing; Pete, could you give us an idea of what type of comp would be needed to hold on to either the restaurant margins or the EBIT \u2013 companywide EBIT margin for this year and maybe talk a little bit about how the greater emphasis on value is maybe changing or not changing that equation?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, David. We\u2019ve historically said 2% to 3% comp would allow us to hold margin and we\u2019ve kind of said that\u2019s in a normal environment. And we\u2019ve defined that as being commodity cost in that 2% to 3% range, but also getting half of that growth from average check and half of that growth from guest count. So when you\u2019re in an environment today where we are going from, more of the sales growth is coming from guest counts than it is from check growth, that puts pressure on that equation. And we are seeing other cost increases in the labor line, additional deprecation, et cetera that are \u2013 that weren\u2019t in our normal environment kind of calculation, which obviously points to a higher than 2% to 3% comp in this environment to maintain or grow the margins.\nDon Thompson: David, just another point, keep in mind please too also that the value aspect of our menu is still in the range of 10% to 15%. So we haven\u2019t seen some huge upsurge relative to the mix of value-based products. The reason that you\u2019ve heard us talk so much about product mix and new food news is because one of the things that we are doing around the world is ensuring that we have promotional food and new food that also is accretive to overall cash flow in the restaurants. And that also helps us quite a bit and that helps us to move average check. A challenge that we have and we talked about in our earlier comments is the fact that if inflation is not as high, we don't have as much pricing power. And so when you think about the overall margin, clearly it's still demand, which we focus on the demand base, it\u2019s still the average check components, pricing is a little softer in terms of what we can take and it's been the trade-up aspects, which is why we focus on the new menu aspects in our core in those larger sandwiches. So we are managing all of that and Tim is ensuring that around the world, those things are part of our plans.\nChris Stent:  Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nWill E. Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Yeah, thanks, guys. I had a question on the product pipeline, and you mentioned a couple of items you rolled out recently. I wanted to just more broadly how you describe your pipeline now in terms of breadth of products and then also in the length of the timeline for rolling them out versus last year and then also maybe versus historically, if you would? Thank you.\nDon Thompson:  I would \u2013 and I\u2019ll ask Tim to also comment about some of the things that he\u2019s seeing in some of the product pipelines around the world. I would tell you today, our product pipeline is more robust from a global perspective and the other aspect of this is, we are moving products around the world at a much quicker pace, which is also evidence of one of the questions earlier about limited time offers. It may appear that we have more of those only because you\u2019re seeing some of the new food news that\u2019s been coming from different markets around the world. But there are several products and platforms and product areas that we have felt \u2013 we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty strong place with continue to develop, but, Tim, maybe some of the things you\u2019ve seen across Europe and now in the U.S.\nTim Fenton: Sure. One of the strategies we\u2019ve had is to really all the new products coming in 2013 to have at least 40% to 50% of them coming form our existing new product pipeline. Great products travel well across different borders and I think a good example is the McWraps right now that are going in the U.S., of course, to go in, in Canada shortly. You compare second quarter of this year in the U.S., the last year we\u2019ve got a very robust product line with the McWraps, the Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie coming in. But we\u2019re also seeing smoothies travel across the system in test in many countries in APMEA as well as in Europe. So I think overall, our overall product development, we\u2019re doing more with existing products we had in different countries and really scaling those and we\u2019re finding out that great products travel real easily across different country borders.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nMichael Tamas \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities: Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Just have a follow-up on an earlier question. Can you just talk about the food margin kind of going forward? Should we expect the same kind of leverage that we saw this quarter or since inflation is going to pick up a little bit in the out quarters versus 1Q, which did actually look like a little deleverage here? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Pete. In my remarks I addressed that. We don\u2019t typically give margin forecast. But we think the decline of a 130 basis points in this first quarter is about as bad as it could get this year and that subsequent quarters, we should see declines in our debt severe.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays.\nJeff A. Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. Just two actual follow-ups on answers you previously gave. One, I was just wondering, Pete, you talked about kind of the balance sheet and taking on incremental debt over the past couple of years. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about the balance of the dividend versus the share repo. It seems like dividend is higher up on the hierarchy. So I\u2019m wondering why whether that\u2019s considered to boost up significantly. And then the other follow-up was just the market share comment you guys made in terms of the U.S., I'm wondering if you can lay that in terms of how it looks in Europe. It sounds like UK and Russia might be slowing a little bit. We know Germany and France is already slow. So I\u2019m just wondering whether your peers are suffering more than you or how you look at the gap between yourselves and them? Thanks.\nPeter J. Bensen: \n.: So as we continue to increase that dividend, that\u2019s kind of added to our existing credit on our balance sheet which is one of the things that they limit to our rating in one of the agency\u2019s models.\nDon Thompson: All right, Jeff, relative to market share, if you looked at our top seven markets, we are slack to growing share in six of the seven. So, and this is something that we feel and again, I hesitate to use the word comfortable because we\u2019re not comfortable with our results. But we feel that the plans are appropriate that our markets have put in place. And so we have actually been trending positively relative to gaining market share around the world and we know our plans are stronger in 2013.\nChris Stent:  Next question is from Jeff Omohundro of Davenport.\nJeff F. Omohundro \u2013 Davenport Securities: Thanks. I just wondered if you could discuss the domestic reimaging program both in terms results versus expectations, and the pacing of the reimage program. Does this macro environment impact franchisee\u2019s receptivity to it? How do you think about that to the balance of the year?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yeah, Jeff, we think we\u2019re going to do about another 800 reimages this year in the U.S. That will as of the end of the year \u2013 as of the end of the quarter here, we\u2019ve got about roughly 40% of the U.S. done interiors and exteriors. And that 800 that we have in the pipeline this year, those are committed, signed up deals that we have in the pipeline. So we have a pretty good line of visibility into that. And while, again, to my earlier comments, we\u2019d love to see margins growing, and sales growing at a faster rate. But these reimage decisions are longer term business building decisions and not an individual quarter or two type decision. So we can\u2019t turn them on and turn them off on a dime and I think it\u2019s important that we continue to make progress on those.\nTim Fenton:  And Jeff, this is Tim. Four weeks ago, the U.S. just had their Combined Manager and Operator Rally. They have it every other year out in Vegas where we have \u2013 you bring together over 18,000 owner-operators and managers and staff. I attended one of those and I can tell you that the interest and the energy on reimaging is as high as it\u2019s ever been. A lot of positive comments, a lot of momentum going into it, so nothing is \u2013 the energy has not waned off at all, if anything it\u2019s moving forward.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.\nJason T. West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, guys. Just going back to the question around the IEO markets around the world, I just want to understand the commentary. Are you guys saying that you\u2019ve seen another leg down in sort of the overall macro in certain places like the UK and Russia or is it just sort of stabilized at a low level, if you could talk a bit more about the trend there? And then when do we lap kind of the slowdown that we saw last year? Has that happened yet in some of your core markets or is that really something that we haven\u2019t lapped yet and we could get to that maybe May, June timeframe?\nDon Thompson:  Hi, Jason. Just a couple of pieces on the IEO. So if you\u2019re looking at overall IEO projections in terms of 2013, of those same seven markets that I talked about, four out of those seven markets are contracting. When you expand that outside of the top seven markets into to, say the top 20 markets, you have another host of markets that are flat or contracting. So we\u2019ve got quite a few markets there where we see the IEO not growing at what we would consider to be an aggressive pace or a more healthy pace. Even those that are growing typically are growing maybe in the 1 percentile range. And so IEO has been soft in terms of growth. Having said that, we realize that our growth is going to come from taking market share and our plans whether they\u2019d be value based, whether they\u2019d be new product based, the operational execution satisfying the needs of customers each and everyday, opening up our operating hours and windows, all of those things are fashioned at us capturing more market share.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies\nAndy M. Barish \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys, a quick question just trying to get a sense of recent trends. It seemed as if mix was negative and then if you kind of look at the first quarter numbers where you talked about negative traffic and pricing of roughly 0.5 or maybe a little bit more, it seems like mix was flat to maybe even a little bit positive, even with the reemphasized value focus. Is there something that\u2019s changed here or something additional that I\u2019m missing?\nPeter J. Bensen:  Andy, it\u2019s Pete. The mix across kind of all of the three major geographies was down slightly in the first quarter. So we had as you indicated, we had the price, which was positive, we had a slight drag from mix, and the slight drag from the guest counts.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Mitch Speiser of Buckingham Research.\nMitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thanks very much. And I just want to ask a question about the global high yield market, whether it\u2019s the top ten markets that you\u2019re in or the top 20. When we think about it, is it just truly cyclical as the reason why it\u2019s flat to declining? Could you may be talk about if there is any structural issues as well? It just seems like eating out it seems to be what people do as economies improve. Yes, the economies are soft, but if there is any competitive issues or any structural issues that are limiting the global eating out market from growing? Thanks.\nDon Thompson:  Hi, Mitch. I don\u2019t know if I would call them structural. I will call them basically just human behavior and consumer behavior. consumer confidence is down in many of the markets around the world. And as a result, when consumer confidence is down, clearly, then discretionary spending is typically down. And so when we look at whether it\u2019d be, again, the U.S. with slower recovery, if we look at the last retail sales reports that we had, those being softer, GDP revisions around the world across Europe, still high unemployment rates across Europe, particularly teen unemployment rates, many of these things are the reasons that as we went through last year, we talked about trying to solidify value messages last year so that as we came into this year, we would not see further erosion to Pete\u2019s point earlier. Having said that, we still need top line basically to help us deliver in terms of the margin as Pete pointed out earlier. But there\u2019s nothing structural, I would say, it\u2019s just consumer confidence is softer. The only that is outside of that is when you look across APMEA and you look at 60% to 70% of our consumers in that geography favor chicken as a protein, particularly in markets like China and Japan, some of those Asian markets. And you have scares like avian influenza or antibiotic issues and food safety issues; then clearly that impacts our business. but those are shorter-term impacts; they\u2019re not structural as well. So, I think what we\u2019re faced with is whether or not overall local economies and macroeconomies will start to trend better. When that begins to happen, we\u2019re in a good position to benefit from it.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff D. Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: Great, thanks. Sorry to do this, but I did want to take another crack at margins. It looks like the U.S. has seen something like three consecutive quarters of, I guess, roughly a 140 basis points of pressure. I\u2019m just curious what color you can provide on the pressure resulting from things like the heightened focus on promoting values, softer same-store sales, even the commodity and labor pressure. And I guess the alternate question here is which of those three have had the greatest influence on that margin pressure?\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes. as Don alluded to this earlier, the value component of our sales in the U.S. continues to be at a relatively similar position. So it\u2019s not as if our Dollar Menu percentage has gone from 13% to 14% to 20%. It has remained relatively stable. What you do see sometimes in these softer economic environments is a little bit in the mix. So I mentioned the product mix was slightly negative to the sales. But we do have a fixed cost base in there that if you aren\u2019t generating the comparable sales, the fixed cost from our management labor from our depreciation, from our third-party rent that obviously is impacted. And if you look through the categories, there is not one of those expense categories that particularly jumps out as being so much more significantly larger than any of the others. So across all of those kind of categories I mentioned, 10 to 20 basis point impact when they\u2019re all going in the same direction, because you can\u2019t leverage the comps, that\u2019s where you get the larger pressure.\nDon Thompson: And Jeff, if you \u2013 going back to Pete\u2019s comments earlier relative to price, he mentioned that one of the price increases from last year at about 120 basis points came off. We replaced that with about 60 basis points. The reason for that is, because consumers are very sensitive to price. And so we don\u2019t have the inflationary environment or the consumer sentiment environment to go out and take the same kind of price increases that historically we did. We do believe that this is not a structural kind of a change. We think that it is based upon the economy at this point. The second point I\u2019d make is, when we think about trade-off, things like McWraps, products like McWraps, thus far in the month of April and as we\u2019ve launched this product, we\u2019ve been driving awareness. So you\u2019ve seen a lot of things in the marketplace with $2 McWraps and different things to try to get those in the hands and mouths of customers. As we move forward, it goes to the full price, which is in the $4 range. So, while we may not get the same unit movement, we will have and see a little bit better margin on that product. So these are all other things that go in a hopper as we continue to manage both margins and also sales success without having guest count erosion.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn W. Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thank you. Just that, I think a slightly different take in what\u2019s been a pretty consistent theme overall margins. There is a really interesting sentence actually in, basically the front of your press release that says the U.S. is focused on menu and convenience initiatives to drive sales and restaurant profitability. And it\u2019s that restaurant profitability piece that I think is interesting, because it almost suggests that that you\u2019re planning on growing restaurant profitability in 2013 in the U.S. while increasing attention on the Dollar Menu and especially increasing attention on the Dollar Menu with some of your competitor have by that definition, backed off. So that\u2019s something that I want to get a sense of is, did franchisees push back on you saying that, the 2012 store level cash flow is something that they don\u2019t want to see go down anymore, it\u2019s kind of the first point. And then secondly, just thinking about from a company store perspective, from a McOpCo perspective, do you think 2013 is a year of investment on the consumer to allow margins to go down willingly or should we expect at the end of the year that restaurant profitability can actually be up?\nDon Thompson: I\u2019ll ask Pete to touch based on both points relative to the cash flows and also just the overall notion on restaurant profitability.\nPeter J. Bensen: Yes. John, actually in 2012 owner-operator cash flow was up in the U.S. So this is not \u2013 what we try to convey with that kind of was the fact that while yes, it is a market share battle out there and we know that growing traffic in that environment is very important. And we know that price sensitivity is a little greater. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got a line-up of products over the summer and the rest of the year that have the potential to improve where we are relative to the first quarter. So, again, in my remarks, I said that while the margin declined to 130 basis points in the first quarter, we expect as move throughout the year that the decline should be less severe that in part is driven by the expectation also that the sales comparison get easier. So implying that we expect because of the sales comparison is easing, we\u2019ll get a little bit more of that top line leverage. And we\u2019re not at a point where we\u2019re going to say that we\u2019re going to get enough leverage to actually kind of grow the margins, but it\u2019s still going to continue to be a market share battle and we feel good as Don said about our product line-ups and our ability to drive some more sales.\nTim Fenton: And John, this is Tim. Just to add with the new products coming with wraps and beverage and breakfast, all higher margins for us as well as focus on beef going on for the second half of the year, all higher margin products.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.\nSara H. Senatore \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a two follow-ups if I may. One is on the top line and it was something, I think that Pete just said about the idea that improving trends against easier comparisons. We didn\u2019t really see that in April, even though comparisons I think are substantially easier than in March. And I guess, I wanted to talk about, when you\u2019re framing that in that context. So I guess what I\u2019m hearing is that, comparisons get easier, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see sort of a symmetrical bounce back versus last year, but maybe just some incremental improvements sequentially. I just wanted to clarify that outlook. And then the second follow-up was on China. Some other margin pressure in APMEA obviously is coming from new unit growth in China. I would have thought with the push towards more developmental license and franchising that we would \u2013 that that would diminish, is that a reasonable expectation going forward or is that drag going to persist for a while?\nDon Thompson: Hi Sara, I\u2019ll take the shot at the first part, and then Pete will answer you at the second part of your question. So relative to April, here\u2019s the things that we\u2019re seeing out there. We understand the existing issues that have been there. We understand the slower recoveries I mentioned earlier. we understand some of the more consistent macroeconomic pressures that pressure consumer confidence. So, as we rolled through the first quarter and as we move into April, we expect some of the high comps that we have, we\u2019re rolling across those. So on that end, we feel better about the overall environment moving forward. Having said that, those macroeconomic pressures still persist and we\u2019re seeing emerging issues that pop up, things like again, we mentioned avian influenza. We\u2019re continuing to see some of the unemployment levels that have continued to increase. Some of the economies are worsening a bit, i.e., France, I mean, they\u2019re seeing the worst economy since World War II. So we\u2019re seeing certain aspects that are worsening a little bit. What does it mean for us? It simply means that the exact plans that we have today, we have to focus on those and focus even harder and we\u2019ve got those inherent in the plans that we have around the world. So we see some positives that are occurring. We see some potential negatives that are occurring, and ours is just to continue to emphasize the plans that we have in place to be able to continue to drive consumers or bring consumers into restaurant and drive business performance forward.\nPeter J. Bensen:  And Sara, regarding the new store margins and our franchisees, we only have 151 of our restaurants franchised in China, so compared to our base of over 1,700. So it\u2019s less than 10% of our restaurants that are franchised there. So, while yes, directionally, that is a positive, it\u2019s still relative to the base not going to be a significant driver. But as I mentioned, there is a lot of work going on around what is the optimal cost to operate those new restaurants. So as we look at the investment levels, making sure that we\u2019re sizing the investment for the current sales opportunity, yet leaving the flexibility there to build for future demand as those trade areas grow. So that it\u2019s getting a lot of focus and attention and as we, as you know, with comps being negative in the quarter, that is a continued drag not only on the new stores, but on all the stores there.\nChris Stent: We have time for one more question, which will be from R. J. Hottovy of Morningstar.\nR. J. Hottovy \u2013 Morningstar Research: Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask a quick question about APMEA and specifically, Japan. Really in your mind, what will it take to get that market turnaround, especially now that we\u2019re lapping about two years of negative results in the territory as well as some reports of some price increases in the region, just wanted to get a sense of your outlook for Japan in particular?\nTim Fenton: Yeah. This is Tim, R.J. First of all, Japan has been one of our most difficult IEO markets as far as negative IEO. We took it on as a special projects just going and really evaluating and segmenting our business. We have revamped our value campaigns, our product lines, and actually have seen a good trending force is trending up in the last couple of months is you\u2019ll read soon. As far as the pricing, I think what you may have read and it was a little bit taken out of context. We are adjusting some prices on our value menu if you will, bringing up a hamburger and a cheeseburger, at the same time, balancing out and bringing down the price of regular fry and some other products. I think the overall price increase and we haven\u2019t taken a price increase since 2008 was just a little over a 1% blended. But a very difficult market, we are encouraged what we\u2019re seeing as of late on changing some of the trajectory of the business.\nChris Stent: All right. we\u2019re about out of time. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Don who has a few closing comments.\nDon Thompson: Well, thanks everyone again for participating with us this morning. And as we wrap up the call, again, really want to appreciate the questions and your thoughts and support of the business. We remain committed to our long-term strategies as we make thoughtful and strategic decisions to mitigate what we hopefully have informed you of, relative to short-term pressures in these challenging times. Notwithstanding these pressures we\u2019re experiencing today, we remain very confident in our future. We have defensible competitive advantages, a resilient business model, and the alignment across our owner-operator suppliers and the company teams to drive enduring and profitable growth for the long-term for our system and our shareholders despite some of the challenges that are being represented and we see around the world. So we remain confident and again, thanks for your participation this morning. And have a great day everyone."}], "2015": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2014, "date": "2015-01-23 17:13:03", "content": "Executives: Chris Stent - VP, IR Don Thompson - President & CEO Pete Bensen - CFO Mike Andres - McDonald's USA President\nAnalysts: Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs David Palmer - RBC Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo David Tarantino - Robert W.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, McDonald's USA President, Mike Andres will join us for Q&A. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonald's.com, as are our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don. Don?\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. 2014 was a difficult year, during which performance fell short of our expectations. But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. Now, while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia Pacific and Middle East Africa, and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls in our internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer term strategies. Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we are making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's, because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's they visit us more often. Now, let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies. For the full year, global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter. Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan. The changes we are making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic, and position McDonald's for longer term growth. Our actions are guided by our four strategic growth priorities, which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to the local customer basis. Beyond our existing menu, we are asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice. Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics, by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we are strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater choice at the local level that reflects attributes like taste preferences and demographics, and those things that makes each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of those attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions. You will also see changes in our customer service models as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosk, table service, or mobile order and payments will modernize our customers interact with our brand and quite simply make it easier to get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be. We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core, and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we are thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying affordable meal. We will also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We are being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like Our Food, Your Questions in markets including the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Collectively, these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've already made in technology, re-imaging our restaurants, and operations improvement with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service to profitability grow the business. We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time, and those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level, and then broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done in the past with beverages and like we are currently doing with Create Your Taste. McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products. Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovations in their disciplines, and company employees focus on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment, while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year. Now, in our July call we outlined the steps required over a 12 to 18 months period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the six month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the markets, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment in those relationships and reemphasized value and reenergized our marketing approaches. We're already seeing a shift in Australia which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu and it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. This is first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September. It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S. which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing, and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Now, over to Germany; negative trends are beginning to moderate with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than two years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near-term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages, and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses. Our position in Australia, the U.S., and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced approach. Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability. Fourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7% due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvements, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market. Finally, in Japan, the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts would take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015. 2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year. In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach, and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges, including China, Russia, Germany, and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business incorporates to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We are committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth into the future. As we embarked on a New Year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long-term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exist within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience, and to become an even more trusted brand. We're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market-to-market and region-to-region around the world. And that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results. Thanks again for being on the call everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete.\nPete Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hi, everyone. 2014 was a challenging year for McDonald's' all around the world. Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments. Today, I'll like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the three factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments. First, the underperformance of our U.S. business; throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace and the sluggish industry growth. For the year, the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7% partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts, which contributed to margin decline. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's revamped marketing approach and development of the new brand love campaign. We expect to encourage additional U.S. restructuring cost in the first quarter. The second thing that we can item that affected our global result was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from loss sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include China, Japan and Hong Kong. Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sale and 5% of global operating income. In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan. With the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28% or 25% in constant currencies, $430 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company share of McDonald's Japan after tax results. The third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014, McDonald's Europe experienced significant decline in company operating margins driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these two markets. For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results. The entire operating income declined for the year with solely driven by Russian and the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies on imported commodity costs in these two markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margin again in 2015, especially in the first half. While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S., our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implanting a new or nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results. In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation. The market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015. In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted market, while sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter. Our best estimate is that it will take at least three to six more months for our business in china to return to a normalized level. For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new consumer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list. Next I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items; commodities, pricing, G&A, and currencies. I'll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity cost rose approximately 3.5% primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity cost ended up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast, as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity cost pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with the full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%; again, driven primarily by beef. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter, and were relatively flat for the full year. For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. To help offset this pressure, we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing abruptly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3%, and lower than food away from home inflation, which ended the year at 3%. During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarter. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near-term. Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year. Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter, and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by cost associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future as well as cost related to our long-term growth initiatives. As I mentioned in October, during 2014, we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. incorporates. These savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiative in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We're nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S., and we'll provide more details on these efforts later this quarter. While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasis an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive pay outs for 2014 were zero for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation. We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currency primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. EXCLUDING incremental incentive base compensation 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy. Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014 with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08, and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation in first quarter 2015 of $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directorial guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion. Nearly $1 billion left in our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2013 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant opening. The most notable reductions will take place in market experiencing the greatest challenges. China, Russia, Germany, and the U.S., our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly with approximately 1.5 year mark for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion is dedicated to re investments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns given each markets potential competitive environment and current industry dynamics. In 2015, we do expect to open more than thousand McDonald's restaurants primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1300 restaurant opening in 2014. On a net basis we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compare with approximately 800 in 2014. The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and the Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platforms up to 2000 restaurants in the U.S. continue to rollout. Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for majority of the reinvestment dollars. Earlier this year, we outlined plans for some additional opportunity to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our capital and ownership structure and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our three-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress. During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our three-year target of at least 1500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly 100 million in savings for 2015 for future long-term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy in the McDonald's' experience in the future. As always, we continue to explore additional savings opportunities. As we move into 2015, we remain on track to deliver against our three year target to return 18 to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividend and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year. We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum. Together; our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions and are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming year is to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers. Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A.\nChris Stent: Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley: Thank you. I'm going to cheat right away and ask two, but that's down from three, so I'm actually complying. A lot of the discussion of plans for the U.S., and it seems more long-term than near-term. The near-term sales results notwithstanding the slight improvement in the month of December have been so weak. I guess I'm curious what the plan is to change the trajectory of sales. And then the related question I guess is on Create Your Taste, I think when we visited the restaurant with you in your mini-meeting in December that was the sixth restaurant with Create Your Taste, now you're talking about 2000. What is making you accelerate this from a financial standpoint? How confident are you that it works? What are the economics in Create Your Taste, I guess is the basic question?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Joe, thanks for the question, questions in this case. Couple of things, what I'll do is I'll respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece and then I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the near-term because I think that was really your question. Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind, we have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over three years. We started this in the innovation center. We moved it to a test restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something we look at all aspects of the implementation, from not only the production side and the service side, to crew interactions, to consumer relevance. And so, we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in the California area, in the SoCal area. We had it in test for about another year plus. Also keep in mind that we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side of this, we've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant, this is about having three plus four-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together. Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization and personalization perspective, it's also about the digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our foods, so that you can understand and see the freshness of the produce and the quality of our proteins. And so this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. And so, hopefully that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit about some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near-term.\nMike Andres: Hi, Joe. As you mentioned, we're looking at our business clearly from a near-term and a longer term perspective. In the near-term, this is a market share game; it's always going to be a market share game. So we trust and we expect to see a more customized approach from our owner operators in terms of owner operator-driven business plan locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multilayered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then our regional management in our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life. I don't think we underestimated the power of ownership by owner operators of their own plan to execute on it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of the three layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops. We've got our national, and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and deliverables of our co-op marketing plans using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach. Certainly, our national messaging comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers and the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used to over the years, and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that it's been our heritage, owner operators at McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as to local marketing store, things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them, that's the key to that. Then, we're looking at how we address the simplicity, or the complexity, I should say, of our menu. We've simplified our menu as we talked about last month. That's going into place as a matter of fact this week. It includes reduction in the EVMs, other menu items; our test market results which included faster order times and faster total times in the drive-through continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S., there's 22 different regions, as you know there is multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, parallel to this short-term we're looking at a longer term, refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience for the customers and continue to differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs. So, Don talked about CYT; you asked about it, that is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the Experience of The Future, we're co-creating this with our owner operators, and we'll present the plan to all of our owner operators at a National Meeting in March. And right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to 2000 stores in 2015.\nChris Stent: Okay. Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse: Hi, thank you for taking the question. So we've seen pretty meaningful pressure on margins in the fourth quarter this year and even if the commodity outlook into '15 is fairly muted, we are starting to see sort of on a more macro level, some signs of QSR wages re-inflating. Is that something you're also seeing in your system and assuming that is a factor in 2015 how should we think about company's philosophy of accepting that pressure versus passing it on and then on the franchise side really their ability to accept that pressure versus need to pass it on?\nPete Bensen: Hey, Karen, it's Pete. As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, margins are such a top line game for us. So, very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially in the U.S. start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line. Having said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment, so pricing as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got National Healthcare impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points. So I think the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and few of these costs, but long-term as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same dynamics are impacting franchisees restaurants as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about Europe; my greatest area of curiosity lies with really the heart of Europe, France has been getting softer in recent months, at least I believe so. Germany has been soft for a while. It doesn't look like in those markets you're playing your B game. You've done a lot of good things there. Are consumer perceptions of McDonald's in fast food changing in Europe or is this purely an economic issue and what are the steps you're taking to restore growth? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Thanks for the question, David. There are some positives and then there are some challengers relative to our business in Europe. Some of the positives are in 2015 we'll see -- if you look globally around the system first, you'll see some good high-yield growth. There are some parts of the Europe where we will see a little bit of high-yield growth, i.e., Germany we will see a bit projected in '15 and in U.K. we will see a bit. France is a more difficult market. France is actually projected to have some high-yield decline. We have been gaining our market share in both France and the U.K. despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environments. Germany, we've lost some share, and we talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that as a priority market there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented. Some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there; actually our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans. And we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumers in those markets. So I'm feeling as -- I mentioned Germany had a -- it seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're cautious as we say it, because there are some challenges across Europe as we all know right now relative to the Euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. But I would tell you it's broadly economic in many of the markets with the exception of Germany where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plans, but for many of the other markets we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there. So it will be primarily an economic piece relative to Europe.\nChris Stent: Next question; Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer: Thanks. Just following up on an earlier question, what level of same-store sales growth do you guys need in both the U.S. and Europe segments to hold on to restaurant level margins in '15? And you touched on it, but do you have any opportunities in the shorter term to control some of your potential cost on -- you mentioned labor, but some of the other cost on the restaurant level line?\nPete Bensen: Jeff, historically we've talked about a 2% to 3% -- I'm sorry, 2% to 3% comp needed to maintain margins in the U.S., and again that's been modeled in what we called a normal year. So when you have normal commodity inflation, normal price elasticity and ability to raise prices normal wage inflation et cetera. So a lot of those variables are a little bit out of whack for 2015. So the prices I already addressed we don't see getting to our historical levels. Wages will probably grow a little faster than normal, especially if you throw in the healthcare impact of that. So again as we think about it, especially in this first half of the year U.S. margin will continue to be a little bit under pressure.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, Pete, around financial strategies; and I guess first as you get into the re-franchising program that you mentioned, are you finding opportunities to potentially go deeper and I guess the big picture question is could you take the system to a much higher franchise percentage overtime, say into the 90s or even approaching a 100% of that even practical or are you thinking about it differently. And then maybe a second part of the financial question would be, are there ways to go deeper on some of the G&A cuts. I know you're reallocating a $100 million but are there other opportunities that you're seeing that might be able to sort of limit the increases that you'll see this year and into next year.\nPete Bensen: Thanks, David. First, on the re-franchising, we started out with our guidance we said at least 1500 restaurants. And we feel comfortable in being able to accomplish that over the next three years. I'll tell you the dialog with the area-of-the-world Presidents has increased around the re-franchising and the benefit that, that can bring to the overall business. So we're not committing to a new target by any means but we also said that after that three year period franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So a 100% we will never be but certainly the ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage overtime is something that we will look at. Yes. On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of The Future. And in fact since we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015. So, for the short-term you heard us say we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area and we recognized these are fairly amount of resources we are reinvesting, but we believe that it's right for the long-term benefit of the business as Mike said to, we kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's restaurants, and as we think about reallocating kind of growth resources by cutting over 800 million of capital allocated to new restaurant openings and redirecting it towards the McDonald's Experience of The Future, we think that's an appropriate and prudent thing to do in this environment.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nDon Thompson: John, you there?\nJohn Glass: Yes. Can you hear me okay?\nPete Bensen: Yes. We can hear you now.\nJohn Glass: Okay, thanks. Could you just clarify if the reduction in CapEx is a one-year reduction or you view this as the new run rate, and what happens to this windfall, is it upside to $18 billion to $20 million return, or you're just making up for the shortfall in the cash flow of the business in the last year or so? And then Mike, can you just talk about the pricing; I think you said in menu item reductions where are you in that process, is it hurting sales, have you find it actually as sales neutral, the same thing for the pricing adjustment, I think you talked about maybe lowering or adjusting prices, is it possible to actually see menu pricing going negative as a result of that?\nPete Bensen: All right, John. I will take the first half and Mike will take the second half. So the cut down to 2 billion, that's not a formative run rate. I mean in these markets that we described, you heard us talk about the growth opportunities that exist in these markets is a, I'd call it a relatively shorter term re-adjustment as we face the realities of the business environment we are operating in. And so, think about it as this is 2015 only and as we move throughout the year and regain that momentum that Don talked about, we'll start to realize where the capital will go in 2015, but keeping that balance between investing in the Experience of the Future and the appropriate level of new restaurant openings, and think about all of this in our $18 billion to $20 billion target.\nDon Thompson: John, one of the things, and I know there has been a couple of questions around this. We firmly believe based upon the strength of our business and the reach of our business, as you all know we touch about 70 million customers a day. One of the things that we've not leveraged strongly has been the whole digital engagement aspect. So as we embarked upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile payment to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today across all age ranges. And so, we've made substantial investments there. Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So we can improve upon on this, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosk in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different. When we decided that we were going to focus on McCaf\u00e9 at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvested it back in existing restaurants. And so, we are doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategy, the in-restaurant experience, and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. And so, as we look at this we will continue to look at our expenditures both internally and externally, but we will also be mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and the level of, I'd say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue on new development strategies in some of those markets. Mike, if you would, a little bit on the menu.\nMike Andres: Yes. So, John, the menu rationalization that is being rolled out as we speak, we are expecting to see the same results that we saw in the test markets which included, obviously it would be a throughput improvement because we're making it easier to order for our customers, plus complexity in the kitchen so the time to get that out the kitchen and through the windows increases. So we're seeing an improved sales result against the control markets and our test to expect to see that happen in the rest of the country. I did not speak specifically about pricing but did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in terms of the efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we're seeing more aggressive disruptive value offers in the marketplaces. As a matter of fact we are moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price dollar menu and more which is complementing their other value messages so the level of aggressive and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitor activity and the economic realities of niche market.\nChris Stent: Next question; Keith Siegner of the UBS.\nKeith Siegner: Thanks, and I want to ask a question about Japan and I realize that it's a relatively small percentage of the overall operating profits but it's having a material impact on results and we've talked about the strategic rationale for this in the past and Pete what you told us is keeping that ownership percentage was important because it let you influence that business and help to improve it. We've had years of negative same-store sales including unit closures. You just mentioned that you expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Is the plan in -- or do we, since you're there to help influence it do we need like a wholesale restating of the brand at this point? Where do we go with Japan? Thanks.\nPete Bensen: Keith, I think that's a fair question. If you think of us the unforeseen event over the last let's say six months, it's had a significant impact on the consumer perception of the brand in Japan and frankly there were some concerns about the consumer perception of the brand before these incidents and so to your point I think there is an opportunity here and talking with the APMEA leadership and the Japan leadership the recognition that there's kind of a clean sheet of paper approach to take a look at what we're doing with our brand positioning there and how we connect with the consumer so we can improve the trends in our business there overtime.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh: Yeah, thanks guys, I wondered if you can talk a little bit more about the simplification of the menu and I know you've mentioned that it's happening right now, wondered if you could talk about how much further you'd be willing to go assuming you do see some improvement here and if you think there will be much more room to take more off of the menu? And then if you can sort of contrast that with any potential new menu items that you may introduce and where they may fall in terms of premium versus value?\nMike Andres: Thanks, Will. I think this menu rationalization process is clearly ongoing as we look forward we had a quite a number of products over the last 18 months or so. So we're rationalizing that looking at clearly what the customers are ordering what they expect to see. I think moving forward, one of the things that we're seeing with Create your Taste obviously that offers unlimited variety to our guest they can use whatever they like, so it takes some of the pressure off of lot of the other menu items that we would have on showing on the menu at any given time. In terms of the overall menu pipeline and what we're looking at today, obviously food is a high priority for me personally. I think that's the foundation of where we're taking the business looking forward and what the expectations of the consumer are. So we're seeing this localization of what more locally relevant products that are being drawn or pulled from the marketplace as they get into the customer insights. We're looking at building our culinary talent to support our talented U.S. chefs. We're including our supplier team of chefs. We got some outside consultants who will bring a fresh and forward thinking perspective on our menu vision. We've got looking at educating America on our food, so this conversation about Our Food, Your Question, giving them facts. We've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion on Media Impression, so that's resonating with our consumers and it's about the quality story. We have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumers' definition of quality moving forward. So we're going to be very aggressive in that area looking at -- we're working with our own operators to revise our product vision for a very different future, as led by the consumer from the provenance to the label ingredients, to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We've opportunities to clean up our ingredient list and enhance the taste. And as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste, we're evolving on menu in response to a lot of the consumer trends. We are launching new products at a national level this year, and we're complementing that on differentiated products at a local level. That's a mission allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and the regional taste that exists out there today, so, a lot of new products news to see in the coming year, and news on our food, in general.\nChris Stent: Next question; Matt DiFrisco of Buckingham Research.\nQ \u2013 Katherine Heng: Hi, this is Katherine for Matt. Can you talk about your comparable GAAP between your December same-store sales to the QSR; overall QSR sandwich category? And also the second part of the question is regarding your Create Your Taste. Can you comment on this any incremental traffic that you're seeing with the customization? Is it adding another level of complexity to the operations; any effect on the speed of service. Thank you.\nMike Andres: Regarding the comp GAAP, clearly, that is an important metric for us to follow and certainly with high awareness of that in our market places today. So we're seeing that -- we're confronted with some inflationary pressures at the \u2013 they're well-documented. And I think we kind of lost our focus on the customer relative the values are the comp competition became more aggressive. So we're seeing that gap start to improve the less negative of course that gap varies by market place. We have markets that actually have a positive comp GAAP. So obviously we're learning from the things that are happening in those markets. But as I mentioned our plans and our tactics in each market, they've got multiple layers, which include proactive and reactive targeted tactics against specific competitor activity.\nPete Bensen: Specifically that the GAAP for December was 4.1, negative 4.1.\nDon Thompson: Relative to Create Your Taste, clearly, we're seeing positive results. We have Australia at a point that, by year end they will implement nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. And again it's a much more integrated platform. It encompasses service, it encompasses multiple order points so the kiosk applications, mobile applications those things as well as being able still approach the business in a traditional sense from through the front counter or through drive-through. We are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. So we're seeing some positives in the market, clearly otherwise we would not be implementing this. I'd tell you that from a service perspective no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's system initially what you're going to see is a slight service increase or decrease, I would say, in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to serve any initial month or two. And then that should come right back and we should be able to be even more efficient. That is the same thing that we're seeing with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far we're very positive on create your taste. But we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement to the U.S. over one or two year period. We're looking at the application to make sure that they give the impact that we want from a guest count, a sale and an average check perspective, which is also a huge aspect, as well as the halo around the freshness of our food and all of our problems. So, we're excited about what we see thus far. But we're also cautious about how we continue to implement this across the year.\nChris Stent: All right. Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.\nQ \u2013 Sara Senatore: Thank you very much. Two follow ups; the first is on Create Your Taste and what you're seeing in Australia. I think one of the differences is certainly for example, is France, we have had some nice success with some of these initiatives. Is that the dine-in traffic or the dine-in is a much stronger portion in the U.S. So I guess the first question is are these kinds of initiatives last relevant in the U.S. because just to mix of your business so much they goes to the drive-through or even carryout. And then, the second question I wanted to ask is a follow-up on the -- you're trying about improving the quality halo and the providence. When I look at the competitive set, you know what I'd call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that \u2013- with I think just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, be you could talk about diagnosing that while some of your very direct competitors seems to be doing well even in the absence of fitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and the sort of the fast casual direction. Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Okay, I'll take both parts. On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics or better experience of the future in difference dynamics because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points and now you can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table counter, web ordering etcetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a strongest queue to end store versus drive-through. However, I will tell you this, what we do is look at things like that and we will tailor those based upon the markets that we're implementing it. We already know that in the U.S. with the restaurant today implementing Create Your Taste that we're seeing very positive results. Therefore what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We make tremendous investments in terms of re-imaging and actually we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and would be offering a Create Your Taste. So they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to appeal the customer the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste that the same taste, to say, Australia has. Australia is at a different point with regard to -- say we're bordering them. France has been. We'll take -- We will learn from all of those things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless Create Your Taste; table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for and really the experience of the future aspect holds them all together. And so you know the season variations across the market. But clearly, we'll look at the performance metrics to make sure we move forward effectively. This is not unlike, again, McCaf\u00e9 was very different in Australia than it is in the U.S., yet and still McCaf\u00e9 has worked in both. On the other side, relative to traditional QSR's, I'd offer this; no one is really shining that brightly relative to the traditional QSR space. I think what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there, that are high-yield customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or fast casual thing. It's about this taste in food. It's about affordability. It is about transparency as a brand. It's about a great service experience that gives them a choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place. Those are the things that will help us prepare all those business and moving forward. So we're not gauging ourself by other QSR's as you were. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity and we want to do that. I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets that we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the experience of the future to light in their market relative to their customer basis. But we're not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectation, quality, service, cleanliness, those things are important in every single market we have around the world today.\nChris Stent: We're out of time. So I'll turn it over to Don, who has a few closing comments.\nDon Thompson: Let me just make a couple of comments because they came up a couple of times about our franchisee and thoughts about -- someone mentioned something relative to implementation of franchisees and they thought about it. I have to tell you in the last couple of years as we've said have been difficult, but as a global system, all of our system has experienced quite a bit and endured many unforeseen changes in the local market. But at the same time, we've charted and began to implement a stronger pathway for future growth. I couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants, and without them we would not have been able to endure those things which we have over the last couple of years. Well, there was geopolitical issues, some food-related issues, our franchisees along with the employees and suppliers have done a tremendous job, and it's that strength that is going to propel us forward, if that unmentioned strength if you would, we don't often talk about when we talk about the financials, but it's one of the things that made McDonald's special and it is one of the things that will fuel our growth as we move forward. I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. 2015, as we say, will be a year of regaining momentum. We're making progress as we move even closer to our customers and as we change to be relevant and more progressive, modern service, genuine hospitality, personal engagement, more relevant customized menus, and a brand that people can trust, truly trust, this is the McDonald's Experience of the Future. It is the path that we are forging, and I would tell you that the future is already on its way. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages and strips of our system are truly a reflection of our ability to learn from our past, but to also be purposeful and agile in the present and to strategically plan and evolve with changing customers perceptions, attitudes, and desires as we move into the future. Thank all of you for attending and participating on the call today, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-10-21 17:10:14", "content": "Executives: Chris Stent - VP, IR Don Thompson - President & CEO Pete Bensen - CFO\nAnalysts: Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Joe Buckley - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray David Tarantino - Robert W.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson, and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don. Don?\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that we are disappointed by our recent performance which fell short of our expectations. Global comparable sales decreased 3.3% for the quarter, operating income was down 14% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.09, a 28% decrease in constant currencies. Third quarter results remain pressured by a number of internal and external factors. A significantly higher tax rate, which was due to an increase in tax reserves in certain foreign markets, impacted earnings per share by $0.26 per share. In addition, the supplier issue in China negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.15 per share, and the estimated impact of store closures in Russia and the Ukraine impacted EPS by $0.01 per share. Excluding the impact of these items, earnings per share for the quarter would have been relatively flat compared to last year. Pete will talk more about these impacts shortly in his comments. This morning I\u2019d like to share our strategy for growth and discuss the actions that we\u2019re taking to improve performance in the U.S. and our priority markets of Germany, Japan and Australia. In some of our markets the reality is that we haven\u2019t been changing at the same rate as our customers\u2019 eating out expectations or, more specifically, their expectations of us at McDonald\u2019s. So we\u2019re changing. And we\u2019re changing aggressively as we refocus on building the business for the McDonald\u2019s system and for our shareholders. The key to our success will be our ability to deliver a more relevant McDonald\u2019s experience for all of our customers. We have listened to our customers and we\u2019ve listened to our customers around the world and better understand what their future experience should look like. Customers want to personalize their meals with locally relevant ingredients. They also want to enjoy eating in a contemporary inviting atmosphere. And they want choices; choices in how they order, choices in what they order and how they\u2019re served. These things make up the McDonald\u2019s experience of the future, and we\u2018re building the future today. Our efforts to create this experience in our restaurants build upon the investments that we\u2019ve already made including the Made for You operating platform, modernized decors and leading edge point of sale and mobile technologies, all brought together in a visible, tangible way to enhance convenience for our customers. In addition to free Wi-Fi in most of our global system, we integrated Apple Pay across 14,000 U.S. restaurants including our drive-throughs. We are the only restaurant to offer this payment convenience in drive-through. We\u2019re also giving customers more choice in how they order and where they eat. Our multiple order point strategy in countries like France and Australia at self order kiosks as well as mobile orders and payment which support both counter and table service. Even more importantly we\u2019re offering our customers even more choice as it relates to our menu. This new concept which we call Create Your Taste combine the custom premium burger platform with the service enhancements I just described to deliver a new dining experience that complements our modernized restaurants. It\u2019s all of these initiatives combined that create the McDonald\u2019s experience of the future. Now we've already moved beyond the innovation centre, we've already moved beyond the learning labs to initial implementation in markets including Australia, the UK and France. And while the food and service components of the experience of the future will look slightly different in each market, based on local customer preferences, I am excited about our ability to differentiate the brand and grow the business. In the US, we\u2019ll fully activate this new experience in three markets by the third quarter of next year and plan to bring additional markets on board as they are ready. And in Australia, plans are already in place to scale the experience of the future across the country next year. We\u2019re working through our global activation plan now and I expect to share more on our next call in January. Let\u2019s talk a little bit more about the US and the specific actions that we\u2019re taking to improve our business today. There is no doubt the US is our biggest area of opportunity relative to financial performance. The questions I receive a number of times as well or not we can drive additional growth in this very important business unit. Quite simply, the answer is yes. As you know, Mike Andres took the helm of the US business earlier this month. Mike is a progressive strategic thinker whose deep understanding of consumers and the market place is complimented by a significant industry experience. This past week Mike and I met with our US company and franchise leaders to discuss the tangible steps we\u2019re taking collectively together the reverse business trends today. We also discussed the actions we\u2019re taking to better connect with customers through our food, the service we provide and the experiences that we create. We\u2019re accelerating efforts to restructure the U.S. organization and provide more economy at the local level so we can satisfy our customers based on their unique taste and preferences in the markets. This shift will enable us to better harness and build on the thinking and the power of the 3000 plus franchises and their entrepreneurial spirit and our restaurant executives who are closest to local market conditions. Our strong menu pipeline in conjunction with greater autonomy in the markets positions these markets to deliver stronger business performance. This has been a historical strength to the US business and we\u2019re putting it back at the forefront once again. In January, we will simplify our menu to better highlight customers\u2019 favourites and to make the experience faster and easier for our customers and our crew. This move will open up opportunities for local markets to pull from the robust global pipeline and introduce new taste in our key growth categories of burgers, chicken, beverages and breakfast. It will also enable regions to address the unique needs, taste and diversity of the local customers with products like the Chorizo Burrito, Cheddar Bacon Onion, The Clubhouse Burger, Mozzarella Sticks and other menu choices that we have both in the U.S. pipeline and the broader global pipeline. The step after enhanced local relevance is providing greater personalization and customization on the menu. And Create Your Taste is designed to do just that. Our marketing approach is another key priority for us and one where we\u2019ve implemented a number of significant changes in the process, the structure and creative direction of our company. We\u2019re also engaging in more transparent dialog with our customers and consumers in general as evidenced by last week\u2019s U.S. debut of Our food Your questions. This build on the success of similar approaches in the UK, Canada and Australia. We are actively inviting customers to join the conversation about the topics that matter most to them relative to McDonald\u2019s particularly the quality of the food we serve in our restaurants. Conveying the facts and adjusting misperceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of our ingredients appeal to our customers and supports the work we\u2019re doing to offer greater menu choice. I am confident in our ability to regain momentum in the U.S. given the actions that we\u2019re taking and the pace at which we\u2019re moving. Now let\u2019s move beyond the U.S. to China and Russia. The supplier issue in China had a significant negative impact on the market\u2019s third quarter results. Comparable sales were down 22.7% for the quarter. We are aggressively executing recovery plans in the impacted markets. We were able to restore full menu to all restaurants in China and Japan by mid September, thanks to supply chain and resourcing teams who were able to shift to alternative product sources for the 5,000 plus affected restaurants in less than 60 days. We\u2019re actively taking steps to rebuild consumer trust. We recently launched a significant brand trust campaign in these markets and we\u2019re providing compelling value offers to invite customers back. We expect it will take six to nine more months for our business to normalize in the impacted markets. Let\u2019s move to Russia where comparable sales remain weak due in large part to the uncertain economic and political environment which is negatively impacting consumer sentiment. With the instability expected to continue through at least fourth quarter and likely in the 2015, we remain focused on continuing to serve high quality menu items and provide a superior restaurant experience. Another question I'm sure is on your mind is what are we doing to regain momentum in our priority markets outside of the United States particularly Germany, Japan and Australia. Germany\u2019s third quarter comparable sales continue to be negative but showed some signs of improvement. We\u2019re adjusting affordability to drive guest counts to our new single, double, triple burger platform that provides greater value across the burger category. At the same time we\u2019re strategically increasing average check by promoting core, premium and snack items in the markets. Furthermore, the recent changes we made to the marketing organization including a new chief marketing officer and advertising agency will provide innovative thinking and bring fresh new perspectives. Let\u2019s now shift to Japan. While current results reflect the impact the supply issue in China, weak comparable sales trends had persisted the past several years in Japan. In addition to the work underway to improve food quality perception the market is working to strengthen its appeal to cost conscious consumers through a renewed focus on value. Any size strength have been added to the \u00a5100 menu and new value bundles are now being offered at lunch. And in Australia, comparable sales in September were solid and represented the highest comp since August, 2012. The market is focused on leading with affordability and convenience by re-launching its loose change menu with additional value option in providing a new way for customers to enjoy McCafe beverages and that\u2019s through the drive-through. And as I mentioned earlier, with aggressive support of the franchisees the market is scaling Create Your Taste in 2015 as part of our McDonald\u2019s experience of the future roll out. Around the world we\u2019re changing and we\u2019re doing it aggressively. Our business is financially strong and so is our conviction and the future of brand McDonald\u2019s and what we know we can become for our customers. I\u2019m excited about the work that's coming to life in our markets around the world; we\u2019re tacking our challenges head on. We\u2019re building on the power of our unique operating model of franchisees, suppliers and employees to position our business to deliver strong performance to our system and to our shareholders over the long term. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Pete for some additional texture on our performance.\nPete Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. In my nearly seven years as CFO third quarter 2014 was perhaps the most challenging because of the confluence of factors all pointing in the same negative direction. Similar to Don, I will depart from the usual approach to my prepared remarks. Instead of walking through the income statement, I\u2019ll begin by discussing the four most significant factors impacting quarterly results. From there I will provide the usual updates on some key quarterly numbers, commodities, pricing and currencies. Then lastly, I will address a couple of topics that I recognized are of utmost interest to you our spending levels and our business model. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing the significant decline in third quarter earnings per share versus a year ago which was primarily due to four factors. The first was a much higher effective tax rate of 44.4%. As indicated in our August sales release, we expected the third quarter rate to be above our annual range of 31% to 33% primarily due to a change in our earnings mix. Subsequent to that sales release, two additional factors drove the effective rate even higher, the tax and interest cost associated with an unfavourable foreign tax court ruling impacting 2003 through 2008 and the impact of additional changes in tax reserves related to income tax audit progression in certain foreign jurisdictions. In total, the court ruling and our audit related reserve adjustments negatively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $260 million or $0.26 per share. The second most significant factor impacting third quarter results was the China supplier issue. In early September, we estimated the total impact from loss sales, expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts and the tax effect of these items to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The actual impact was approximately $0.15 per share and the impact was felt in virtually every line of our P&L. The markets most affected by this include China, Japan and Hong Kong which collectively represent about 10% of global system wide sales and about 5% of global operating income. Work is underway APMEA to rebuild customer trust now that our supply chain and restaurant inventories have been largely restored. While we expect our business to fully recover, the pace of recovery is difficult to forecast. With sales trends showing signs of improvement our best estimate is that it will take at least six to nine more months for our business to return to a normalized level. Based on our current internal forecast we expect the supplier issue to have a negative impact on fourth quarter results in the range of $0.07 to $0.10 per share. The third significant impact on this quarter\u2019s result was the decline in the McDonald\u2019s U.S. business. The segment operating income declined $107 million or about $0.07 per share primarily due to soft comparable sales which contributed to margin declines. The fourth most significant impact on our third quarter earnings was the decline in Europe\u2019s company operating margins driven by Russia and Ukraine, due to the economic slowdown, decline in consumer sentiment, store closures and weakening currencies in these markets. In fact, these two countries accounted for substantially all of Europe\u2019s third quarter company operating margin decline. Next I want to provide an update on some key financial items commodities, pricing and currencies. I\u2019ll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe. For the quarter U.S. commodity cost rose 3% primarily due to higher beef and dairy prices. This pressure is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, our revised full year outlook for the U.S. basket of goods is an increase of 2.5% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe\u2019s commodity costs were relatively flat for the third quarter. We have reduced our full year outlook for Europe\u2019s grocery basket to reflect an increase of no more than 1% which implies relatively flat commodity cost for fourth quarter. In terms of menu pricing, the U.S. is running about 2% at the end of September versus year-to-date food away from home inflation which stands at 2.5%. At 2%, our current pricing is notably lower than the 3% pricing level we were at in June. We felt it was important to bring our pricing more in line with food away from home so we did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off during third quarter. This pressured third quarter margins and we expected to continue into fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve said before, our preference is to keep pricing at or below food away from home index as we continue to balance the importance of driving guest counts with profitability. Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment averaging about 2% year-over-year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted third quarter EPS by a $0.01. At current exchange rates, which reflect a stronger U.S. dollar, we expect a negative impact of fourth quarter EPS off $0.05 to $0.06 with a full year negative impact of $0.09 to $0.10. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move toward the end of the year. Given these internal and external pressures we remain focused on those things within our control. At the top of the list is our overall spending. Starting with capital expenditures at the beginning of 2014, we announced the capital expenditures would be $2.9 billion to $3 billion for the year. In light of our recent performance and current market conditions we are proactively reducing this. Our 2014 spend will now be approximately $2.7 billion, which will be lower than our capital spend last year. Through September we have opened about 750 new restaurants totally and expect to open about 1400 new restaurants this year fewer than the 1500 to 1600 originally planned. This reduction is driven primarily by fewer openings in markets like China in response to local market dynamics. Earlier this year, we indicated we were scrutinizing our G&A spending. Internally, we refer to this initiative as resourcing for growth, a name that I think embodies the strategic intent of our process to identify key resources with the potential to be deployed more efficiently and effectively toward our critical growth drivers. For several months now we\u2019ve been working with third party experts to thoroughly analyze our cost structure in both our corporate and U.S. functions including our overall organization structure and staffing levels in order to fund key growth initiatives. Based on our preliminary work we are targeting to identify and redirect nearly $100 million in savings for future long term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy and McDonald\u2019s experienced of the future. As we move forward, I do not expect a significant reduction in our total G&A expense but firmly believe that we are taking appropriate and prudent actions for the long term. We are balancing the need to curtail spending in certain areas in light of the present situation while remaining committed to funding our more significant growth opportunities. We expect to share more perspective on our 2015 G&A outlook in connection with our fourth quarter call in January. As many of you have noted the McDonald\u2019s business model and structure is somewhat differentiated in the restaurant industry. In our wholly-owned markets, which represent over 27000 restaurants, McDonald\u2019s is the landlord and the franchisor. This secures long term tenure at our locations and allows us to make real estate and franchising decisions separately. We are co-investing with our franchisees in the overall success of the business. Accordingly, alignment is critical and our model is built on a highly collaborative approach which includes engagement with franchisees who operate 81% of our restaurants. This approach also requires more time and resources both of which we believe result in better long term decisions that benefit both our system and our shareholders. We also believe that this partnership type approach has ultimately resulted in a superior and stable group of franchisees who generate industry leading average unit volumes and cash flows in virtually all the market in which we compete. The business model has also served our shareholders well over time with our stock generating total shareholder returns that have exceeded both the Dow and the S&P not only for the last 10 years but over the last 25 years as well. While McDonald's total shareholder return has lagged the broader markets the last couple of years, we are confident that the actions we are taking in both the near and long-term will position us to continue to deliver significant shareholder returns. We will continue to consider new opportunity to enhance both short and long-term value. Above all else, we seek to balance the needs of all stakeholders from our shareholders to our franchisees to the broader McDonald\u2019s system. We use it as a critical screen for all decisions, because that has been the key our enduring profitable growth throughout our history and will continue to be going forward. Even with softer performance, the McDonald's business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. During the first nine months of 2014, McDonald's generated $6.2 billion of operating income, raised the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.85 per share and returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's current three year cash return target of $18 billion to $20 billion is a testament to our ongoing commitment to built long-term shareholder value. As we enter fourth quarter and prepare our plans for 2015, we recognized that improved results won't happen overnight. Let me share with you our current view on how 2014 will close out. While our underlying goal is to change the trajectory of our financial performance, our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure on the business in the near-term. Given the nature of the factors that I discussed, which are impacting our global business, we expect top and bottom-line performance to remain pressured in fourth quarter with comparable sales expected to be negative in October. Let me assure you that there is an acute understanding of the situation along with a strong sense of urgency to take the necessary steps to address our current challenges. Hopefully, you heard some of that on the call today. We are confident that the work being done by our teams around the world will yield sustained profitable growth in the long-term. We have faced numerous challenges throughout our history and have always managed through these cycles. If you could travel the world and visit our franchisees and our restaurant teams, you would share our confidence that we will manage through these latest challenges as well. It all comes back to the strength of our brand, our business model and our approach to investing and growing the business over the long-term. Our North Star continues to be the customer in better delivering on their needs. Since our founding in 1955, that has been the key to our growth and profitability. Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A.\nChris Stent: Thanks, Pete. I will now open the call for analysts and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer: Thank you. As it relate to your U.S. performance, I believe the comp underperformed the industry by a little over 500 basis points in both July and August. And I was wondering if you could provide what that gap to the industry looked like in September?\nDon Thompson: Hey, Brian, this is Don. Yes, our comp gap in the month of September was a little over 600 basis points, so a 6.3%.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.\nJoe Buckley - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thank you. A couple questions, if I can. So you\u2019re talking about a couple of changes in the U.S., a simplified menu effective in January and then three markets where you have either more extensive Create Your Own experience changes. Could you talk about what a customer in the U.S. restaurant is going to see broadly I would assume in January from a simplified menu? And then, what they are going to see and experience in those three markets that I think you are targeting for the third quarter? And then, just one financial question. Pete, the CapEx coming down make sense I think. How much more room is there for 2015 in terms of that CapEx number coming down more significantly?\nDon Thompson: Hey Joe. First of all, relative to consumers in the U.S. in 2015, they will see several different things. And I'll try to talk about a few of those. One, is because we are moving to more regionalize local windows again, which is a strength of the McDonald system, and we have moved away from that. They will see more regional products throughout the U.S. We have about 21 regions. We have over 150 odd cooperatives across the United States and so those markets will get to pull down from shelf promotions. And they can pull down from some of the broader menu pipeline offerings that we have. So customers will begin to see that again and there will be a stronger balance between the regional markets and then the national base marketing. As you may recall, the regional markets typically will focus on offerings and promotions, the national markets will focus on the quality, the brand McDonald, what we are talking about relative to our people in larger events. So that's one major change that you will begin to see and customers will see. The second one is going to be how we engage in conversation with our customers through both social and traditional medium. So this is going to be something that's more felt and heard relative to dialog than it's just basically seen. With the launch of Our food Your questions is a great example of that and that is a platform we will leverage across the year. You will see initial expansion of the experience in the future in those three markets that we talked about. Experience of the future is much more than just Create Your Taste, it is a broader service experience, it is a broader digitally engaged, if you would, mobilily engaged experience in the restaurants. And some of you may have seen that relative some of our markets like France or what's taking place in Australia. Also, we will be launching the mobile app, the global app. In the U.S., it will include promotional offers, also some mobile payment opportunities such as Apple Pay and also some things possibly with our e-Arch Card. And the last piece would be some of the markets may see some of the testing that would go on relative the various pricing structures that had been a balance pricing relationships across the entire menu board. So these are some of the things that will be out and about in the marketplace. And I\u2019m sure our customers will give us appropriate feedback. But we look aggressively to get these things moving.\nPete Benson: And Joe its Pete. Regarding the CapEx question, a significant majority of this year's reduction was due to a reduction in openings. And we are frankly scrubbing the pipeline and there is probably opportunity for that new opening number to go down a little bit more next year. What we are going to continue to investigate as we move to finalizing the plans over the next month to six weeks, is what is the level of reinvestment spending that we\u2019re going to need around the experience of the future and some of these initiatives. So when we get back together in January, we\u2019ll be able to give you more specific guidance not only on total capital but how that splits between new units and reinvestment.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco at Buckingham\nMatt DiFrisco - Buckingham: Thank you. I guess Pete, can you just talk about how may be in context the recent struggles globally, especially in APNEA may have impacted some of the things I think that people have also discussed or debated with you somehow opportunities possibly to refranchise take that 81% global number higher as well as maybe even divesting some businesses like Japan, is there any impact to the valuation of what we might get from those of the cash proceeds? Given the near term struggles if you can give us any sort of color on that or does that sort of push down and kick the can down the road a little longer on maybe being able to see some of those monetization of that?\nPete Benson: Yes, Matt, for this year-to-date we\u2019ve refranchised a little over 300 restaurants compared to about 225 a year ago. So we were starting to see a nice uptick in the activity, and 90% that refranchising this year was in our focus areas of Europe and APMEA. As you point out -- and a big bulk of those were in China. And so as you point out with the supplier ratio over there, our activities are probably delayed slightly, but I don\u2019t think dramatically because this is a temporary event. It will return to normal and the business model is still attractive and still franchisable. So while it may be slightly delayed, we don't see it having a significant impact in either our timing or our ability to extract value from those refranchising transactions.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan at Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray: Thank you, good morning. On the technology front, I think I heard you say you are bringing some new technologies to U.S .markets. Can you talk about how you chose them and if they\u2019re giving a full suite of offerings or is it going to be kind of a layered approach? And then just a follow up on a number or comment around APMEA in saying it takes six to nine months potentially to get to a normalized level. Could you define that is normalized less negative or positive? Thank you.\nDon Thompson: Hi Nicole, I talk a little bit first about the digital piece and then we can talk about the recovery efforts over in China specifically. Relative to digital, as you may recall, Nicole, a couple of years we began to focus quite intently on our digital efforts, and we have done several things. One is that we move forward to be able to bring in appropriate talent to support our digital effort. So we brought in Atif Rafiq, who had a tremendous background in the tech sector and more specifically with Amazon. We also have been hiring quite a few digital leads around the world from world class organizations. And to that point we actually opened up our first digital office at San Francisco near Silicon Valley to continue to be able to recruit and bring in talent. That is a critical aspect of how we select the applications and the platforms with which we move forward. We also have several markets around the world that had a jump start relative to some of the mobile applications such as France with mobile pay and actually some promotional offers.  So we have leveraged that. We did a major test in Australia to look at the actual global application what we call the global app, which is built upon our new path technology system and allows us to continue to add on different applications to support various needs from pay and order to other things such as music. We\u2019ve talked about those in the past. That global app will be launched in 2015 with some of the promotional offers in the U.S. and we will continue expanding the already established mobile applications that we have in some of the markets outside of the US. So we are pretty excited about those. We are also excited about the relationship that we have begun to cultivate the most recent of which was Apple Pay and we\u2019re the only restaurant, as I mentioned, that will be able to allow consumers to leverage Apple Pay in the drive-through. And so and one of the only restaurant businesses that Apple has had a strategic partnership with. So that is the beginning of some of the things that we are doing; there are more things that we have in the pipeline. Relative to the recovery in China, when we assess the six to nine months we work with the local markets and we look at their timeline, there are several things that have been done there. First of all in China, we had to make sure that we can solidify the supply chain. As I mentioned the folks did an aggressive job, a great job aggressively of being able to really reallocate our supply chain in 60 days to ensure we can get China and Japan back up. We also wanted to make sure that relative to anything that has taken place in that market there are food safety processes procedures was robust as they should be and as we wanted them to be. We have hired outside food safety auditors to support those, the things that we do in that regard along with additional training of our employees. So those things do take a look at more time. And then once we got supply back in the market place we began and launched our brand trust campaign which is a holistic brand recovery campaign focused on bringing customers back into the restaurant. As you know, in China, if there is an incident such as avian influenza or food scare or food quality scare it does take a while for customer to come back to any restaurant establishment. So that's how we have worked with our local market and some of the things that we have been doing and again we assessed it at six to nine more months before we see recovery.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird: Hi, Good morning. My question for Don on the overall strategy. I guess one of the hallmarks the way I understand it of McDonald's is the speed and consistency of the operations ,and I think you have highlighted some struggles on that front this year, and I just wanted to get an update on your progress on improving your operations. And then secondly, I think a lot of the initiatives you are talking about the experience of the future, sound like they might be adding more complexity to the system. So everything from localization to create your own taste. So I am just wondering if you could comment on your confidence level on being able to execute that that added complexity, if you will?\nDon Thompson: Thanks for the question, David. First of all you know anything that we would implement in an restaurant we have taken it require a bit of testing. So relative to create your case has been through the innovation lab, the innovation center and the testing protocols there it has been in a restaurant near the innovation center, we moved it out to Lagoona, we had had testing outside of the U.S. in some of the markets and now as we move forward in Australia, what they are really doing is the soft, the front side of the role out in the Australian market. And so we know that from an operational perspective we are able and capable of delivering this experience in the restaurant enabled by the technology advancements and the point of sale platform that we put into the restaurant. So on the operational side they are relative to Create Your Taste, we built very, very strongly that that is doable. We know it is based upon what we have done already relative to basic simplification of the restaurant and rating ourselves for things like Create Your Taste and for basic customer satisfaction at higher level. In markets like the U.S. they been through what they call an operations reset. That operations reset combined with the minimum simplification efforts that our aimed at reducing complexity of low volume items. That's an important part. The complexity of low volume items are the things that we\u2019re looking to simply and remove from the restaurants. When we do that we enable ourselves to be able to then pull down additional products that we can flow through our operating system in the U.S. Now, one of the things that I would also add here is when you look at some of the things that we are looking to do in terms of products, those products are actually made easier based upon some of the investments we made whether they be the point of sale system or may be things like the high density kitchen where we have more condiments that we are able to make relative to putting those things inside the Made for You cooking system. So the Made for You system, simplification of some of the items and our focus on operations are the reason that we have high confidence in Create Your Taste relative to the in store capability. The other thing that I mentioned at this point and some of you already know this, Create Your Taste is an in store execution as we began. That is the way that we are delivering on that expectation and experience in the restaurant. Customers seem to really really -- it appeals the customers in a great way and will continue doing that. We have a different solution that we are work on relative to the drive-through.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein - Barclays: Great. Thank you very much. So a question on the U.S. business. I know in the press release and in your comments earlier you made -- mentioned I think that the issue at least from a sales perspective is more sustained, competitive activity I know over the past year or two. I think that was more down played, I think was more you guys in the management believe and that it was more self-inflicted, less about what these more peers might be doing. But maybe just in terms of that change in view, like what have the sandwich competitors done most recently that might have negatively impacting McDonald\u2019s? And how much credit maybe do you give to the strength of whether it's just casual or whether it's the consumer push into better quality, healthy offerings? I mean, just seems like there is a confluence of factors that sound which might be now out of your control relative to self-inflicted. Any thoughts on that would be great.\nDon Thompson: Hey Jeff. We -- one thing we do not do too often, Jeff, and you probably won\u2019t hear us do too often, and that\u2019s talk about for fact that our focus is now on competitive pressure. What we do is acknowledge it; they\u2019re folks in the marketplace that are doing some solid things. I would still hold true to the fact that our biggest challenge is what we do at McDonald\u2019s and how we move forward. Do we have the aggressiveness in the local markets, have we allowed the aggressiveness in local markets or have we been a little bit more focused on an aligned national platform, which doesn\u2019t leverage that local relevance. And if I look that, the local GRPs that I then assign against those local relevance products as they are putting for those in their local windows in the markets, we have not been as strong as we need to be. And I think that is one of the areas relative to our menu that you guys haven't seen and many of you have asked questions about. What is in the menu pipeline? I think you'll get a broader chance to see that as the local markets, as we get back to what we've historically done with local markets. Allow them to pull down products that are relevant in their markets and to drive those aggressively. And so, we are going to do that. Notwithstanding competitors that are there, competitors have always been in the marketplace. It can't be used as an excuse for us. What it is is an opportunity for us to build our business by taking back some of those folks who are visiting others right now.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens: Yes. Thanks guys. I wonder if you could touch a little bit more on the U.S. trends. In September in particular, what you would credit that slow down to, despite the interest you're picking up little bit? And if also you could speak the different day for us, such as breakfast where you did giveaway some coffee and then lunch and dinner where it seems like competition is both picking up on the value and premium end? If there is much difference in sales growth or declines, I needed those (inaudible)?\nPete Bensen: Will, so a couple of things. This year, as you just mentioned, in the U.S. system they focused on coffee and also there was NFL promotion. Last year, it was comping against wings, which do drive a higher average check in sales. While not as successful as we wanted wings to be last year. but by most measures it was still a solid promotion relative to going up against the NFL promotion and coffee. So those two things did not deliver at the same rate, while we were able to sample quite a bit of coffee. And our breakfast business overall is up on the year and continues to be up. The challenge that we have had is that it has to be about more than breakfast. So when you look at that balance -- and I just talked about local markets, we have got to focus on that breakfast and coffee aspect, as well as focusing on larger sandwiches, which enhance and increase that average check. And so that was one of the gaps that -- the biggest gap I would say that we had in the month of September. What we comped up against and also the fact that our promotional efforts were more sample based in terms of driving coffee than they were more of a breakfast building base just for that particular month. And I know that the U.S. system understands and realizes that as we move forward.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAndy Barish - Jefferies: Hey guys. Just wondering more near-term and then 2015 kind of the extent of the McOpCo margin decline kind of Q4 versus 3Q? And then, I know its early, but how are you guys thinking about what you need to start to drive those McOpCo margins back higher, whether its comps or the commodity environment for 2015?\nDon Thompson: Andy, good question. For 2014, as we kind of -- as I indicated in my remarks, we see continued pressure in the fourth quarter. Reflecting on the factors that were impacting the third quarter right, U.S. the biggest factor driving the U.S. decline vis-a-vis the decline in the second quarter was less pricing. And so, we would expect less pricing to still be a factor in the fourth quarter, as well as the 3% commodity increase. Those were the two biggest factors driving this quarter. And thus, we see it now will impact the fourth quarter as well. In Europe, virtually a 100% of the decline was in Russia -- was due to Russia and Ukraine. 75% of that was Russia, the rest was the Ukraine. With the relatively favorable commodity environment over there, a lot of the other markets were doing fairly well on their margins actually. UK was driving it and Germany continued to be the biggest drag on the McOpCo margins outside the Ukraine and Russia for Europe. And it\u2019s too early to give a picture on 2015. But as you point out, driving comps, our McOpCo margins are really a top-line gain and driving comp sales is going to be the biggest key to getting that going again.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer - Wells Fargo: Thanks. I did hear your comments on minor reductions for future developments. But why do you believe only a minor reduction is appropriate? And I guess, what you mean by that is just going back to what other timeframe was, the early 2000s U.S. (inaudible) sales were soft, you guys were losing shares. And I think it was in the early 2000, 2002, 2003 along those lines, you dramatically, dramatically got new development and then, within couple years life got better and realize that it's not all cause and effect, it\u2019s not that simple. But again, just sort of thinking bigger picture here, what's the hesitation in pursuing your better is not bigger strategy in 2016 and beyond? Why don't you think that would not work again?\nDon Thompson: Hey Jeff, this is Don. And I ask Pete to comment as well. Let me just draw a little distinction here. Relative to what happened in the early 2000s, that development was taking place primarily in the U.S. business. So when we were -- in the U.S. business, we were trying to grow via development and that development was being driven across the market. We were not as sophisticated as we are in site selection. It was more based upon basically new unit movement or new unit sales, and that is not the appropriate formula. So today, if I look at where we are growing, that gives us some confidence relative to how we are growing, at what pace. When you're developing into markets like the Chinas of the world, the Indias of the world, some of the other markets across Europe and Asia, Korea, then those markets have yielded some more solid returns. And so, I just want to draw a little distinction. This is a very different approach. We have much high levels of site selection capability than we did then and it is not a concentrated and focused growth like it was in the U.S., it's a much more diverse portfolio.\nPete Bensen: Yes. And Jeff, I just add a couple of points. One, the starting point is dramatically different from 2002. I mean, we are starting from a much higher position of average unit volumes. And actually, our new store returns are doing fairly well. So as I said earlier to Andy, comps are the key to getting the margins and the profitability going again around the fringes. Turning a 100 or two openings up the portfolio for year is not going to have a dramatic impact. And in fact, the down point, our site selection capabilities are too old, the number of markets we are growing in is much more expanded than it was a little more than 10 years ago. So we feel it\u2019s appropriate to skim back a little bit, but for the long-term perspective and growth of the business we are going to continue to open a units where it makes sense and where we are going to get good returns. \nChris Stent: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.\nKeith Siegner - UBS: Thanks. Pete, of the over $200 million year-over-year reduction, APMEA operating profit dollars, how much of that reduction came from the loss of sales and the deleverage effect versus how much came from may be more discrete items like inventory write off as you throughout put (inaudible) or anything else that might be one time? If you could give us some color on those two pieces that would be very helpful. Thanks.\nPete Bensen: Yes, Keith, at the operation income level the China supplier issue that $0.15 translated into about $180 million of operating income decline. Roughly half of that was McOpCo margins. So that I would argue was that clearly was sales driven. Then the next biggest peach was our lower earnings pick up from our joint ventures notably Japan and while that had a little bit of inventory write off and some other costs, that result would also mostly sales driven along with royalty some franchisee support and then finally there were probably about $20 million that was truly inventory write off and an additional supply chain cost to get that supply back on par in China and Hong Kong.\nChris Stent: The next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. It\u2019s just two kind of related questions. The first one is the overarching concern I sometimes hear is that McDonald's is struggling to resonate with millennial consumers, in particularly in the U.S. And so I was wondering if you could talk about the two strategies that I think you might be most targeted to that group and whether you are starting to see any initial signs that you are getting traction? And those are -- and my interpretation would be the sort of digital social media and then also the our food your questions and just whether or not that strategy is working because it sounds like you are not actually changing recipes in response to concerns, you just change kind of explain and alleviate some of those concerns. So if you just talk realistically about kind of the millennial question?\nDon Thompson: Thanks Sarah. The real point, so let me just broadly relative to millennial. If you look at the quick service restraint industry there is a decline relative to millennial usages of the quick service restaurant industry. I think that as we look at it as McDonald's what we believe that we are able to do is to appeal to some of those customers and clearly come into our business. And so as we look at it and I should say appeal to more of those customers and customers use our business now but appeal to more of the millennials. But it is a much broader aspect in the millennial. Our Food Your Question is about creating a dialog. It is not about a one question answer kind of a piece. Usually there is a back and forth relative to ingredients, platforms, integrity, sources in terms of where our food comes from. It may be relative to social responsibility. What we are doing relative to deforestation. So there are a number of questions that come up and it is about engaging in a dialog. We want to make sure that we are a transparent brand. There are a lot of misperceptions out here relative to our food and what we want to do is make sure that we at least provide an opportunity for people to directly ask those questions. So this for us is just a way for us to better build this brand and tell the truth about McDonald's and our supply chain which is absolutely fabulous. And so that it the intent there. On the digital front, we believe that digital, mobile technologies, kiosk related ordering the opportunities to be able to allow customers choice in their McDonald's experience is good for all of our customers. We think that there may be a skew clearly to a millennial, that would be probably and even stronger skew towards those that are younger than millennials, but as we move forward that is one of the things that we would be able to better define. We do know that the experience of the future resonates well with our customers around the world.\nChris Stent: We have four more questions. So we will take those. First David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer - RBC: Thanks. Just a follow up on that, the millennial issue has been well documented but I guess we should keep in perspective that the U.S. factory comps are up, I think around 2% lately. So do you believe that there is more of millennial issue with McDonald's and that's the differentiator and I suspect that you in your own self assessment see some other key differences there resulting in the widening gap to the industry and what you think those are? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: David, I believe that relative to the comp gap, so I think the comp gap is a combination of several things, some things relative to what we are conveying out there relative to what others are conveying in terms of the menu offerings. I think that is one of the challenges. I think it is also about the value that we are offering or not offering and that is another aspect of the comp gap. If you look at some of those changes, the question is whether or not our value and our food options are resonating as strongly and so I believe that that is the fundamental basis of some of the challenges that we are having. Having said that one of the ways that we best address that is by ensuring that the local markets have the opportunity to move forward to products and the offerings that will resonate locally. When I say resonate locally that means resonate across the demographics of those local areas. So that is everything from millennials all the way up to those that are more mature in the marketplace that are coming to visit McDonald\u2019s or other (inaudible). So what we want to make sure we do is have the right food, the experience is right and we\u2019re engaging customers to be able to have their choice and a great McDonald\u2019s experience with great food quality and great service and a clean environment as we always done and at an affordable price. When we\u2019re able to do that at McDonald\u2019s we\u2019ll be fine within the marketplace in terms of generating sales. The broader opportunity is to be even more relevant relative to the digital experience, the restaurant of the future and the customization opportunities for our food, and that\u2019s what you heard us talk a little bit about today.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I wanted to go back, Pete, to the G&A question and why you\u2019re not seeing or don\u2019t think you can actually get net positive reduction in G&A? Your G&A runs higher substantially higher at least on a per store basis than your peers and I understand you got more complexity but you\u2019ve also got better scale. So I guess just two questions, you can respond to that but two questions I guess around. One, what is the chance you actually you will be able to see a net reduction in absolute G&A in \u201915, not how much but just can you do that? And secondly, maybe help us understand the $2.5 billion in SG&A how much is actually G&A and how much is corporate versus what\u2019s in the fields or in the divisions?\nPete Bensen: Hey, John. As we talked about from the very beginning when we start talking about this scrutiny of the G&A, we believe that there are significant opportunities to grow this business by investing in the digital strategy and this McDonald\u2019s experience in the future, and so smarter for us we think to redirect resources to that. And as I indicated, we believe we\u2019re targeting about $100 million from U.S. in core to repurpose, if you will, or redirect to those initiatives. And we believe over time we\u2019ve continued, we always look at ways to be efficient and more effective with our spend. If we thought minus three was our trend line for the next couple of years you\u2019d be hearing a more dramatic cut and taking cost out of this business, because that would be the only way to continue to grow profitability if we saw that was a permanent change to our revenue stream. But we don\u2019t believe cutting our way to prosperity is going to be helpful for the long term of this business and smarter for us we think to redirect these savings into these growth opportunity that Don outlined.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Howard Penney of Hedgeye.\nHoward Penney - Hedgeye: Thanks very much. Last night the CEO of Chipotle spent 10 minutes of his opening comments on his conference call basically attacking the legacy QSR operators with business models and I could just paraphrase as being broken, given the type of food they serve. And if I broaden those comments out to what CEOs of supermarkets like (inaudible) telling about more customers coming into the natural all natural organic GMO free products. is Mr. Ells first of all and the lot of things that you talked about today I can appreciate the need for the technology but it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re really going in the direction where consumers are going. So just curious as to you think that Mr. Ells justified in his comment the legacy (inaudible) operators which I assume he included you in that comment. Thank you.\nDon Thompson: Hi, Howard, thanks for the question. Howard, we believe that if you look at the broader market and you look at what customers are asking for, they are asking for transparency they\u2019re asking to know what\u2019s in the food, they\u2019re asking for integrity of the food. There are cases and there are markets where organics are drivers at a higher level. But I would offer is that the highest level is more about their transparency, integrity and also the ability to customize and have what they want on a sandwich or a burger. I think it is what has given rise to so many very small but quite a few burger openings, specialty burger house openings. And so there is still quite a resonance relative to food, there is a big resonance relative to how I can customize. There is an appeal and you\u2019ll see us in some categories looking to different products possibly organics we actually are doing it in certain markets. But I would it\u2019s not the main driver if you would, we\u2019re at the main drive but I mean we wouldn\u2019t have the clearly the number of customers that we have today visiting the McDonald\u2019s restaurant. I will never say that someone else particularly (inaudible). I know Steve I use to visit his first restaurant when we entered into an initial partnership back then when we were sharing the McDonald\u2019s supply chain system which helped him as he move forward Chipotle. But I would not say Steve is wrong or right, I think each individual organization has to look at that and look at it through the eyes of the customers and what customers are asking them to deliver. And so I think you\u2019ll see a lot of changes though, Howard, I mean if these things become even more large, even more trendy then that something clearly we\u2019ll look even more aggressively at. But we do have markets around the world that focus more on organics we have markets that focus more on locally relevant products. France just finished up one of their launches and it was basically speaking about French beef; we talk about Australian beef over in Australia. In the U.S., I think we have some additional opportunities to talk about the fact that the vast majority of our food at McDonald\u2019s in the U.S. is produced right here in the U.S. so we have some opportunities to talk about that in the U.S. a little bit more.\nChris Stent: Our last question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Great, thank you so much. Don, my perception is been that your previous health and wellness movement, and I am not talking about just organic but just health and wellness in general, but previously \u201880s and the \u201890s were driven from an older and drastic and maybe what\u2019s different now is that the movement is being driven by younger demographic that's in younger demographic that according to your own data that you don\u2019t have the appeal to as may be you did to that same age cohort 10 or 20 years ago. I mean - you haven\u2019t even mention the words for McDonald\u2019s about health and wellness and just what kind of an opportunity that you would have and if I can ask the question directly I mean why is that really front n centre in terms of lot of the product development work that we\u2019re talking about today?\nDon Thompson: Great question, John, and actually it is. Health and wellness defined by many of the customers that we talk to coming to McDonald\u2019s were visiting the informal eating out industry. And that's a big point those that actually visit the industry and buy food from the industry. We - its translated into real and fresh in many cases, and that has been a major driver of our strategies as we move forward. Customers want real food and they want to make sure they understand that its real food and they want fresh food. So they want to understand the sources or the origin, they want to make sure that I know what\u2019s it, where it came from and the integrity of those sources. And so what we\u2019re trying to do is more visually depict that both in our marketing, in our foods of question and even more importantly at the important movement of truth which is in the restaurants and for those of you visit our restaurants and been behind the counters you\u2019re seeing the freshness and the quality of our produce. However ,not everyone has done and seen that and so we want to make sure that we\u2019re transparent enough to do that many times real and fresh is also conveyed. If you look at it relative to those products those offerings that are selling the most it\u2019s based upon the component make up of the food itself. So it may be differences in cheeses, differences in sauces all of these things either things that make up a great tasting burger or sandwich we\u2019re offering today. And so this is a direction that we\u2019re moving in and we\u2019ll continue to stay close John with our customers relative to what it is they want and what it is that they want to see because we can deliver that as a McDonald\u2019s system.\nChris Stent: That concludes our Q&A. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Don who has a few closing comments.\nDon Thompson: First of all, thanks for your participation this morning as we wrap up the call I really appreciate again all of you joining us. We have a clear plan to regain momentum in the U.S. and I think you\u2019ve heard that and we want to regain momentum around the world as we aggressively advance programs and initiatives that are designed to deliver more relevant experiences and as we bring the McDonald\u2019s experience to the future to our customers even faster. We\u2019re ready to drive our business forward by creating real and noticeable changes for our customers and partnership with our tremendous system of franchises supplier partners and company employees. Our actions are intention and they strategically address what customers want from us today. They\u2019re based in the insights that we have gained from the marketplaces and they\u2019re based in what customers will expect tomorrow. I'm excited about the work that we\u2019re doing and I'm confident we will achieve our goals. I just wish you all a great day and a great weekend. Take care."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-07-22 17:05:06", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin - VP of Investor Relations Don Thompson - President and CEO Peter J.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin : Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on the call are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson and our CFO, Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.  And before I turn it over to Don I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. And both documents are both available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results I wanted to provide a brief perspective on our performance relative to our expectations. I also want to share with you how our strategies have evolved, to guide our actions going forward. As we shared with you at our Investor meeting last November and in the last couple of quarterly calls we entered 2014 well aware of the challenges we face for comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. And we don't expect any material changes to this operating environment in the second half of the year.  Our financial model is built on growing comparable sales, which in turn drive profitability. So when comparable sales are relatively flat as in second quarter our ability to grow income is significantly impacted. We've often said that there is no one silver bullet or single solution for driving sustained growth. In fact the key to our success over time has been that we've executed multiple initiatives simultaneously. Enduring success requires an ever stronger foundation. So we're pushing forward on a multiple fronts as we focus on those areas within our control to enhance our relevance and appeal to consumers.  Earlier this year we evolved our Plan to Win Framework, refocusing our planning and actions on what matters most to our customers; relevant food choices, easier engagement with our brand through digital and greater transparency into the quality of our food and what we stand for as a brand. Serving good food through good people and being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate is what McDonald\u2019s stands for.  In April we shared our updated global Plan to Win framework with the more than 15,000 franchises, suppliers and company employees at our Biannual Worldwide Convention. Our decentralized system is now moving forward as we run with more than 35,000 restaurants in 119 countries aligned around an evolved global Plan to Win framework and executing in a way that takes into account local consumer needs and local business environments.  As we work to regain business momentum we are pursuing two parallel paths. First, we are strengthening key foundational elements of our business to deliver our better overall customer experience today. And second, we are making progress on comprehensive strategies in pursuit of the sizeable growth opportunities that lie before us. These activities are interrelated and together they position us to drive profitable growth over the long turn.  Let me talk first about the work currently underway for foundational elements of our business today. These include value first. We are evaluating the relationship between pricing and quality perception across our menu board and that's because value is one of our grand pillars. So we must continue to fortify our position within this key consumer attribute.  Second, operations and service; around the world we are enhancing our operations and service platforms to improve the customer experience and ultimately increase visits. This includes the service reset in the United States and servicing kitchen enhancements in Europe.  Third, marketing. We are taking actions to reestablish our marketing leadership position globally. In some markets, this means adding fresh perspectives by bringing in new leadership or agency partners. In others it means heightening our awareness of how customers use McDonald\u2019s and creating stronger messages to reinforce our place in customers\u2019 lives. And around the world we are also strengthening our creative messages by placing greater emphasis on the quality of our food and again reestablishing the emotional connection that our customers associate with the McDonald\u2019s experience.  The fourth area is simplification. We are streamlining our merchandizing menu board and product offerings and in addition to making it easier for customer to order their favorite products, this will reduce complexity in our restaurants which in turn should enhance accuracy and speed of service. Getting these foundational element right is critical to maximizing the impact of the additional growth initiatives that we are actively pursuing within the strategic priorities of the Plan to Win framework. Specifically these growth initiatives include menu customization and personalization, digital engagement and brand trust. In the area of menu customization and personalization our initial efforts focus on delivering the best burger experience to our customers. I'll talk more later about our learning lab we recently established in the United States to help us better understand what matters most to customers in this arena today?  We are also accelerating our digital leverage as we talked about before, leveraging learning from markets like France and Australia we\u2019re now executing some elements of our e-commerce digital strategies. We are also testing various additional elements of our strategy in other markets like the U.S, Sweden and the UK as we refine and execute our global digital vision. And we are taking meaningful action to become even a more respected brand including our work with the World Wildlife Fund and the Alliance for Healthier Generation which was found by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation. These represent just the subset of our broader sustainability efforts.  We are pursuing these initiatives holistically and building on investments we already made to deliver an unparalleled experience to our customers and consumers in general. It\u2019s these combined efforts that give me confidence in the future and our ability to drive enduring profitable growth for our system and our shareholders over the long turn. Let's now turn to performance for the quarter. Global comparable sales were relatively flat for the second quarter and comparable guest counts were negative. Operating income was down 1% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.40, a 1% increase in constant currencies. Several markets delivered solid results, stronger operating income performance in China, the UK and France was offset by weaker performance in markets including Germany, Japan, the U.S. and Australia. These four markets remain priority areas of focus for us and I'll talk more later about the actions we're taking in these markets to reignite momentum. We're moving with a sense of urgency but recognize that it will take time to see the results of our actions. Our franchise business model is a clear advantage for us but it also requires alignment around our plans and actions and this takes time. Once allied it takes time to enact changes in the restaurant and time for customers to notice the changes we've made and reward us with more visits. Therefore we expect continued volatility across markets for the second half of the year and expect full year 2014 global comparable sales to be relatively similar to year-to-date June performance with July global comparable sales excepted to be negative.  Let\u2019s talk more specifically about performance and the actions we are talking by geography starting with the U.S. In the United States comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.5% and operating income increased 1%. While comparable sales were disappointing the U.S. is making progress in three critical areas, improving service through the operations reset, focusing on menu and strengthening our marketing position. The service reset was designed to place greater emphasis on the critical role of proper staffing, scheduling and positioning in our restaurants across all the day parts.  Over the last six months our operation support staff are making [inaudible] with all franchise and company owned restaurants to recalibrate around service and customer experience standards. Restaurants across the U.S. are now executing as planned and we are beginning to see a reduction in order accuracy complaints.  From a menu standpoint, we are placing greater emphasis on the balance between our core classics and the number of new products that are being introduced into the marketplace and this is to ensure that they can be delivered at the speed and convenience that customers expect from McDonald's.  We are also continuing to innovate. We recently started a restaurant on the West Coast and created a learning lab to help better understand what matters most to customers when it comes to delivering the absolute best burger experience. It definitely starts with great ingredients like our high quality burger, 100% beef with a pinch of salt and pepper but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s about creating an engaging experience which addresses all elements of customer sensory perceptions and leverages the investments that we already made in technology, reimaging our physical plans and digital to create a more personalized memorable experience that our customers will feel good about. The U.S. is also taking actions to strengthen marketing leadership. We reorganized the marketing department and are reallocating our median mix to place greater emphasis on digital channels. We are also strengthening our creative, to connect more deeply with customers placing an even greater emphasis on the quality of our great food and on the strong emotional connection that our customers already have with our great brand. Let\u2019s now move to Europe, where comparable sales were down 1% for the quarter and operating income was down 4% in constant currencies. These results reflect solid performance in the UK and France partially offset by weak results in Germany and a slowdown in Russia. The UK\u2019s track record of solid performance continues due in part to its strong customer centric planning process. While second quarter comparable sales were positive they softened compared to recent trends, partially because we are now lapping last year\u2019s successful blended ice rollout. We continue to grow market share through strong premium promotional activity which is complemented by an ongoing focus on breakfast, extended hours and side-by-side dry fruits. Comparable sales continue to be positive in France and we are gaining market share despite a contracting informal eating out industry. The recent launch of our new premium Chicken Patty in April helped reinforce strong food quality perceptions in the marketplace. Germany remains the primary area of focus as negative sales and guest count momentum continues. The leadership team is actively working to reset the foundation, focusing its efforts on improving our food quality and value perceptions and regaining consumers trust. These include strengthening our marketing organization in creative and evaluating our affordability platform and ensure that we offer compelling values to customers across the entire menu. Now let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comparable sales were up 1.1% for the quarter and operating income increased 1% in constant currencies. Strong comparable sales performance in China as well as positive performance in many other markets was somewhat offset by continued weakness in Japan. In China, comparable sales increased 8.8% for the quarter, partly reflecting the lap of last year\u2019s Avian influenza. Given volatile consumers sentiment in China we\u2019re focused on enhancing our all day value platform to drive traffic and grow market share. At the same time we are building on our strong momentum in breakfast and through brand extensions such as delivery, dessert kiosks and mid-caf\u00e9. In Australia, affordability remains key to driving traffic with consumer confidence at the lowest levels since 2008. We're strengthening our value proposition by relaunching our Loose Change menu with compelling value offer and we're also making it easier for our customers to enjoy the great tasting McCafe beverages that they have grown to love.  Negative momentum Japan persisted amid a highly competitive environment and a contracting informal eating out industry. The leadership team remains focused on regaining customer relevance and loyalty by repositioning the affordability platform to resonate more strongly with customers while working to differentiate the McDonald\u2019s experience through menu innovation and a focus on the family and happy meal business. Around the world markets continue to adjust their plans to be even more relevant to customers but we have recognized again that it will take time to reignite momentum. Overall 2014 is a year of strengthening the foundational drivers of our business, activities that are critical in enabling and advancing our longer-term strategies. Even during periods of softer performance our business continues to generate significant levels of cash. Our first priority regarding use of cash is to invest in our business to drive future growth and future returns. In addition we've established an $18 billion to $20 billion cash return to shareholders target between 2014 and 2015. Year-to-date June, we've returned $2.8 billion towards that goal.  I want to close by reemphasizing my confidence in McDonald\u2019s. We continue to move forward as one system guided by the framework of our global Plan to Win and relentlessly focused on the significant opportunities that exist within our strategic global growth priorities to optimize our menu by serving our customers\u2019 favorite food and drink, to modernize the customer experience so that it's even more memorable, to broaden accessibility so that we deliver unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted and respected brand.  We're moving forward thoughtfully and with a sense of urgency. Our plans and actions build on our core strengths and I am confident that they will ultimately result in additional business from new and existing customers. Thanks again everyone. I'll now turn it over to Pete. \nPeter J. Bensen:  Thanks, Don and hello everyone. The McDonald\u2019s system and our financial model are built with the expectation of future sales growth. Yet we know from history that our top line growth overtime is neither consistent nor linear. In addition any growth is a product of the significant base off of which we operate which includes serving approximately 70 million customers every day and generating industry leading average unit volumes in virtually all of the countries in which we operate.  Importantly this large base also provides financial resiliency during periods of softer performance. Though we did not meet our growth targets through the first six months McDonald\u2019s still generated over $4.1 billion of operating income. Our strong financial foundation allows us to remain focused on the significant long term opportunities that we believe McDonald\u2019s is uniquely positioned to seize, which is why we continue our disciplined approach to investing in targeted growth opportunities.  We know that enduring success requires an ever stronger foundation. So we're pushing forward on multiple fronts guided by our evolved Plan to Win framework and the strategic growth priorities. As Don discussed it takes time to evaluate and align with franchises on the changes needed and then implement them in our restaurants, and time for customers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits.  I am confident that we're taking the right steps to strengthen our foundation and position the company for future growth. Our charge over the next 12 to 18 months is to accelerate the changes, effectively communicate the enhancements to our customers and execute at the highest standards in our restaurants.  Now turning to the results, for the six months ended June system wide sales increased 3% in constant currencies primarily due to expansion. Combined operating margin declined 60 basis points to 29.7% over that same period reflecting the softer results. McDonald\u2019s is primarily a franchisor with over 80% of our global restaurants operated by local businessmen and women. As such franchise margins drive overall profitability comprising approximately 70% of restaurant margin dollars.  In second quarter, the franchise margin dollars increased 2% in constant currencies while the margin percent declined 60 basis points to 82.2%. Expansion continued to contribute to the margin dollar growth whereas soft comparable sales, increased rent and depreciation expense and the impact of refranchising pressured the margin percent.  Global company operated margin dollars for the quarter totaled $816 million, a 3 % decline in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 60 basis points to 17.1 % as relatively flat comparable sales could not offset cost pressures throughout the P&L. Europe's margin declined which I will discuss in a moment, accounted for the majority of the global margin decline. In the U.S., second quarter company operated margins declined 40 basis points to 18.3% due to higher labor and 3% higher commodity costs. As a result of effective risk management efforts and supplier production efficiencies we are maintaining our full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket of 1% to 2%. In terms of pricing, U.S. is running about 3% at the end of June. This is the midpoint for the full year 2014 projected food away from home inflation of 2.5% to 3.5%. Through June, food away from home inflation stands at 2.2%. So we will be disciplined with future price increases as we move through the second half of the year. In Europe second quarter company operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 18.6%, primarily impacted by higher commodity costs in Russia and Ukraine due to weaker currencies as well as negative performance in Germany. Russia and Ukraine import approximately half of their commodities, most of which are denominated in either Euros or U.S dollars. For a perspective, Russia and Ukraine accounted for nearly all of Europe second quarter company operated margin decline. Europe's projected full year commodity cost increase remains at 1% to 2%. Excluding currency, commodity costs were relatively flat in the first half of the year which implies a second half increase of about 2%. Our menu price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment averaging about 2% year-over-year.  Turning to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 60 basis points to 13.7% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher labor, occupancy and other costs. In addition, new restaurant openings negatively impacted the segment\u2019s margin percent though to a lesser degree than a year ago. The decline in the margin percent was also impacted by the mix of relatively lower margin markets like China contributing a greater share of the overall margin dollars. That being said we are encouraged by the margin percent improvements we are seeing in certain individual markets, including China in this high growth area of the world.  With our current sales outlook and expected currency volatility in some of our company owned markets we expect continued pressure on consolidated company operated margins in the second half, more significant pressure in the U.S due to higher labor expenses, partly as a result of planned minimum wage increases in several states and likely less benefit from pricing.  Second quarter G&A expenses increased 3% in constant currencies primarily due to our biannual worldwide convention in April and higher employee costs partly related to our long term growth initiatives. One of our key competitive advantages is our size and scale and our conventionist integral and maintaining alignment so that we could move together as one system. We have reduced our full year projected constant currency G&A increase from 8% to 4% to 5% primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation as a result of not expecting to meet our growth targets. Even with softer performance the McDonald\u2019s business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. Our first priority remains at reinvesting this cash in our business to build future returns and enhance shareholder value. These investments are balanced between opening 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants and re-imaging over 1,000 existing locations in 2014. We remain committed to this effort and are making steady progress towards these targets. Through June we've opened 461 new restaurants globally and relative to reimaging we've completed about 90 projects in the U.S, 100 in Europe and 120 in APMEA. Similar to prior year\u2019s new restaurant openings and reimaging projects tend to be more loaded in the back half of the year.  Lastly let me discuss foreign currency translation which positively impacted second quarter EPS by a $0.01. At current exchange rates we expect minimal impact on third quarter EPS with a full year negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05. As usual please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we progress through the second half of the year.  In closing I remain confident in the choices we're making to position McDonald\u2019s for enduring profitable growth. We're patiently and deliberately making investments to-date to strengthen our foundation and leverage our significant competitive advantages in the $1.2 trillion global and formal eating out category.  Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A. \nKathy Martin:  Great, thanks Pete. I am going to open the call for analysts and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). So we're going to start with Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. \nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you very much and good morning. I guess my question here is, how much do you believe your ability to regrow same-store sales of the system is really completely under your control at this point and what I mean by that is you look at your business and your peak sales per unit, really without game changing platforms in the pipe, with competition that's I mean arguably more of a headwind than you've ever witnessed. And so I guess what I am trying to understand from your perspective is what is it really that you can tweak at this point given all these factors. There is really going to be some serious incremenality of this asset base, you talked about better service, improved marketing, getting better practice and I just wonder if that's enough to really continue to try to get incrementality out of a $2.6 million-$2.5 million as has been designed?   \nDon Thompson: Hi, Brian this is Don, thanks for the question. Brian I think there is two different things that are taking place. If I look at the longer term and you are asking kind of two questions, I think the short and the longer-term. If I look at the longer-term Brian I would tell you the strategic growth priorities that are set for the U.S. business and around the world are solid, very solid and they are really focused on -- let's take the U.S., menu customization and personalization and I mentioned starting with Burger leadership, accelerating digital engagement, actually both the engagement and the experience, so e-commerce is a part of that along with some other things that we're looking at, delivering to our customer base.  And then enhancing the overall brand relevance and thrust particularly around our food quality and employment opportunity, images and the side of the business that people look to relative to that. So and those things are part of a much broader sustainability movement, if you would in McDonald\u2019s than many people have seen, I feel really, really good about where those strategies are going. Those combined with some of the broader development strategies we've seen in markets like APMEA, those longer-term strategies are solid.  In the shorter-term what we're looking forward is to fortify the base the foundation of McDonald\u2019s today so that we're ready for those growth opportunities. So to your point as we look at the basic market is strengthening right now. Are we're making sure that the presence that we have, the awareness that we have and share of voice that we have are solid, strong and allocated to the appropriate media, that's being fortified.  But look at the operational reset in the U.S., it is focused on the peak periods and our ability to deliver at those peak periods, which has something to do clearly with the productivity in the restaurants and the staffing levels in the restaurant and these are things that our leadership operators have discussed in United States with our U.S. team and they are moving forward on those things.  So supported by breakfast, the food quality messaging the operations focused on the peak periods and staffing scheduling positioning and reasserting market leadership those are foundational pieces. But they have to be re-established Brian. Those to your point are probably more incremental. The other things that I mention are longer term growth strategies are stronger relative to how we look at growth into the future.\nKathy Martin:  Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Buckingham.\nMatt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research: Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit or give us an update on the, the back of the house prep tables in the United States and if we could expect what type of margin benefit at the store level have you seen there, were the benefits you can talk about that as well as any sort of new products that we could see as far as with the extended refrigeration life, what does this enable you to do maybe going down the line?\nDon Thompson: Thanks Matt. I'll talk a little bit about you know broader menu pipeline and Pete talk about back of house. Relative to the broader menu pipeline in the U.S. right now they are really focused on the balance between our core products, the core classic favorites, the Big Macs, the nuggets, et cetera and also the new products and new innovation. There are numerous products and ideas that are in the pipeline and in the global pipeline from around the world. Our U.S. team is currently testing some of those and looking at some of those. They are still in the areas that we've mentioned of chicken, beef breakfast and beverages. So if I look at the broader menu of that part is intact.  The relative to the kitchen and the productivity and efficiency and issues in the kitchen, the high density kitchen was intended to give us more flexibility and allow refrigeration on the prep table which gives us a little bit stronger capability relative to products. You will see -- will have seen a couple of products which you will be seeing more products relative to that but I want everyone keep in mind this is going to be a balanced approach. It is not all new products and not taking care of the core classics and favorites because we need to see baseline improvements in all core products as well as a boost over the baseline based upon the new products that we implement.\nKathy Martin:  Our next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America.\nJoe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you. Sort of about broad question you\u2019ve been talking about the global operating environment and certainly operating environment in the U.S has been soft for a couple of years now. And the strategies you are implementing are very execution focused and really haven't changed but also don\u2019t seem to be gaining traction. What sort of we thinking about the next 12 to 18 months from an incremental change that can drive sales? And then secondly does it make sense to keep opening stores at the pace, the current pace of expansion, I guess I'm asking the question globally but especially in the U.S., where I think you have couple of 100 next doors targeted if I'm not mistaken?\nDon Thompson: Hi, Joe thanks for the question. Last part first, if you look at the U.S. and you look at a couple of hundred stores keep in mind a large portion of those are relocation base restaurants that we have. So on a percentile basis the U.S. is not opening a lot of stores. We are opening an opportunity and there continues to be market opportunities for McDonald's. But there is not a lot of restaurants in the U.S., I think their number\u2019s about 120 stores net in the U.S. business.  So the broader development opportunities and growth opportunities across the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa region across markets like Russia, clearly Pete I and the team are looking at some of the markets like the Russias of the world given this the current economic environment and determining what we decide to do Russia, China, what their pace of growth looks like. We do that in an ongoing way.  In the U.S. the focal point that we have to grow this business is as I mentioned secure the foundational elements of the business. We got to make sure that our restaurants both company-operated and franchise are operating at the right level. So this is not about one side or the other side, this is simply about making sure that the restaurants are running well and if they are staffed effectively.  Clearly there has been some level of trepidation relative to staffing up our restaurant based upon some legislative impact of things that are coming down the pipe, such as whether it be healthcare reform or the potential of minimum wage from a federal perspective but even more broadly more state minimum wage increases. So there is a little trepidation relative to that but as I mentioned earlier the franchisees with our company team in the U.S. have really had some great discussions around what they call operations reset and are focused on building a business at those peak periods. We understand how profitable that is, across the day parts but we are also not giving up on the growth strategies.  Those growth strategies around digital engagement, around what we are able to do with our ability to have a balanced menu and to afford customization for our customers then incorporate it with some of the things that we are looking at it doing relative to re-establishing a higher respective brand profile for McDonald's, all those things are going to be well intact and moving forward. So over the next you know 12 to 18 months expect to see focused us on both those parallel paths. In the near term you are going to see more on the foundational piece through rest of 2014 you will see more of the other aspects at some point in 2015.\nKathy Martin:  Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to piggy back on the last question and maybe ask from a big pictures perspective why do you think it's taking so long to stabilize the sales trends in places like the U.S. and Germany and I guess part two of the question would be is do you think a need to make more radical changes to the strategy than what you are talking about based on the trajectory of the recovery or maybe lack of recovery that you are seeing?\nDon Thompson : Hi, David. Thanks for the question. I'll speak about this in two different ways. One is I'll give a little update on the priority markets and the other one is really how do we look at, I\u2018ll call it turnaround time. The -- taking the turnaround time piece first, we are clearly moving with a sense of urgency and anyone inside the system knows that and it's quite an aggressive sense of urgency, toward the end of the first quarter, we had priority market business as we had talked about earlier on one of our calls, post that time the market themselves with the franchisees and company employees have been getting together to discuss the local action plans that it takes to drive the business.  It just so happens in most of these markets those opportunities are around the three areas we've been talking about, around the value/affordability arena, around the strength and focus of our marketing and how we are marketing with a balance between core and new products and also making sure that as we look at our broader business that we are focused on bringing customers forward and they understand the transparency and food quality levels within McDonald's. So those things are things we\u2019re moving forward aggressively on and markets are putting those plans together. In a franchised organization like ours, it does take some time. As I mentioned the strength of our system is our franchisees, there is no doubt about it. At the same time it takes time to get that alignment and in time to get these things in a restaurant, in time for them to move forward. So we understand that, we understand the timeline, we want to do it right. I don't want to continue to have implementations that are not consumer-based because then we come back six, 12 months later and we are changing those again. So we are doing these things in the right way with the right processes but it does take some time. The other piece relative to the priority market, just a bit of an update. Different markets will take different times relative to their recovery pace. If you all remember back in early 2000s the UK was a challenging market. It took several years and interestingly enough to focus on similar things that we are talking about now slightly deeper hole at the time, but we've been able to come back with a very balanced approach and we\u2019ve had very strong market success. Germany today is in that kind of a mode. We got to have a big kind of a recovery. It\u2019s similar to the UK. Japan is in a similar mode as that. I think the U.S is moving forward at a bit more aggressive or stronger quicker pace if you would, however it's still going to take time in the U.S. as we solidify these foundational elements. The Australia, Australia also I think will be at a quicker pace. We are able to still do some innovations in Australia while we fortify some of these base elements.  In all of these markets we've had some changes in our marketing functions, in our marketing leadership. Some of these markets had changes in our agencies. We've had some other leadership personnel changes in some of the markets. So we believe we are moving forward urgently and aggressively but we are also doing it in a way that will have some longstanding impact and believe me this is not the kind of thing that I'm comfortable about. This is not the kind of thing that I would say I sleep well at night over thinking that the pace of change is as quickly as I would like but I know that the markets are going through this in an appropriate way and an appropriate pace and they are doing it with a sense of urgency.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from David Palmer from RBC.\nDavid Palmer - RBC : Thank you. It does not look like McDonald\u2019s is descending traffic like it's done in similar periods of low industry growth like '09. You got price increases, I think you said 3% and obviously you are not pounding away on the dollar menu like you did back then. But I know traffic is important to you guys. So when McDonald\u2019s does improve its traffic how do you -- and perhaps it's a '15 event, what do you think would be that driver, the key ingredients for that is -- will it lean on operations changes and digital engagement or perhaps could we see a return to more active food news or something else? Thanks. \nDon Thompson:  David, I think you just hit them but again I'll say that there is parallel paths here. We have to make sure that the foundation is strong enough to accept the digital strategies and engagement that we're going to be putting into the restaurant. The operational foundation has to be strong enough for us to be able to move forward with customization and personalization at the level that we want to at McDonald\u2019s. Back in 2000 -- if you look into 2008-\u201809 time frame this was a slightly different time frame. Several things and I'll mention a couple of them.  One of them the strength of the broader legislative impact on cash flow was not as aggressive. Having said that what that means is that clearly as a franchisee or a franchisor as we look at the margins there is as I mentioned earlier there has been some trepidation around if you step up then is this going to hurt cash flow even more.  But I think that the strength of the U.S team with our franchisees is addressing that and beginning to address that appropriately relative to the need for us to do that to move into these growth strategies. So that part is a little bit different. The other thing that is different is that back then we made a modification to the dollar menu which was merely product based and we were able to do that with one product change or at the time we had two product changes over about a five year period.  At this point we're looking at the overall pricing structure of our menu board because we've seen a bit of a split relative to the lower end of the menu and then the higher end. All of these things the U.S team is looking at as we look at the price tier. So there a couple of differences David nonetheless we're not giving up on value or affordability and I know it's one of the things being implemented in the U.S. business. \nPeter J. Bensen: And David as you think about pricing for the rest of this year, we've said we're up above 3% trailing '12 June but in May we had about 90 basis points of pricing roll off from a year ago and we only replaced that with about 30 basis points pricing. And as we look to that broader food away from home that's projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% but it's only up 2.2% through June. So we're keeping an eye on all those metrics too. So don't think we aren't conscious of what that consumer is feeling today and their ability to come into McDonald\u2019s more often. And yet kind of walking that delicate balance between that aspect of the business as-well-as some of these additional cost pressures that Don mentioned that are coming down the pike. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. \nJeffery Bernstein - Barclays : Great. Thank you very much. Don maybe a follow-up, you talked a lot about the franchise system and how it takes little bit of time to move that system relative to if you owned it yourself. At the same time I think you noted earlier this year the franchisees, based on your meetings with them, your discussions and what not, they are still engaged and supportive of the corporate initiative and I guess you had your convention recently but perhaps that's driven by the fact that profitability is still close to peak levels. But what are the complaints or rumblings you are hearing if any of late, don\u2019t know if any things that management feels the need that we need to prioritize this to address whether it's the new product news, the promotional activity, pricing, remodels. I am just kind of wondering how that sentiment, how those relationships just over the past couple of years the struggles are trending? \nDon Thompson: Thanks, Jeff. Anytime there is softness in cash flow we will have -- we have to have even more effective discussions even more planning together as to how we move the business and there will always be concerns when we see softness in cash flow. This is a for profit business and so that's going to occur. And our franchisees have those concerns as-well-as we do in company operated restaurants. So just to set that stage, we will always have -- when there is a softness in cash flow the conversations we're having now.  And the franchisees are not -- they are not at all time highs, they have seen higher levels of cash flow. And so they want to get back to some of those levels clearly and we want them back at those levels so they can have personal cash flow but invest in the business and invest in the communities the way that they do. So we have engaged in clearly a lot more conversations and communications around where we take this business.  The other thing I\u2019ll say though there is a realization that the franchises have they are not seeking and searching for silver bullet either. They understand what they\u2019ve executed in the past to grow the business has been a group of initiatives that have had an impact on multiple fronts. So as we look forward into the future the fact that we\u2019re talking about food and the food experience, the fact that we\u2019re talking about the in-restaurant experience with digital engagement experiences, the fact that we\u2019re talking about how this brand is perceived by consumers and the local communities all of those things fit very well together and I think the franchisees are excited about that.  Clearly in the current situation and environment there are concerns that the franchisees have. And that is what we\u2019re working through with them but I will say that our leadership groups have been at the table and have been solid relative to the way that they are given input cost and guidance and certainly as they\u2019d like to see us move-in and we\u2019re moving in many of those areas. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. \nJeff Farmer - Wells Fargo: Thank you and just shifting gears a little bit, as you guys think about your plan to refranchise I think you said at least 1,500 restaurants by the end of 2016 how should we view that as potential impact on not only that consolidated operating income margin but also your ROIC number and again I just ask that in the context of -- I think we\u2019re all pretty familiar with the margin tailwind that you saw going back to the mid to late 2000s with developmental licensing and things like that in Latin America big margin tailwind, big ROIC tailwind as you look at these group of 1,500 restaurants, how should we think about them?\nDon Thompson: Jeff yeah good question thanks. First of all in terms of the -- just the set expectations in terms of the timing, we\u2019ve done about 200 refranchises through this year. When we think about it the next two years \u201915 and \u201916 will probably carry the bulk of that refranchising activity, in part because there are some markets that we really need to build that franchising infrastructure around to get that going in a more significant way. That being said, directionally while we haven\u2019t quantified some of those benefits that you\u2019re calling out directionally those are benefits that we would expect to see to the P&L.  So we expect franchising does have a favorable impact to our overall combined operating margins. It does have a favorable impact to the G&A levels that we need to support the business. It does have a favorable impact to the ROIIC. So those are all directionally consistent with where we plan to go with this franchising. \nKathy Martin: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. \nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: Don, I see moving with a urgency but around that you must have a set of deadlines internally and some goals and it seems like you\u2019ve pushed this out originally maybe you\u2019re talking about the first half of this year being a reset and then maybe some benefits in the second half now it seems like it\u2019s really going to be pushed off in to \u201915, so what are the milestones specifically that you hope to achieve this year or even next quarter towards those goals? And specifically when are we going to see tangible benefits from both the customization and the digital strategy either it\u2019s this year or it\u2019s \u201915 what is the timeframe for those things?\nDon Thompson: Thanks John, the last part, customization and digital strategies we\u2019re seeing certain things in some markets already. So we\u2019ve got, clearly as I\u2019ve mentioned there are some things that we\u2019ve been doing in France, there are some things that we\u2019re already doing in Australia from a test perspective. You\u2019ll see some limited testing in the U.S. the latter part of the year, 2015 again you\u2019ll see more robustness in terms of some of the things that will come to market in 2015. That is not saying that will be January 1st, that is saying that it will be in 2015.  The aspects around what we\u2019re doing on customization and personalization clearly there are some things that we\u2019re looking at getting going this year relative to testing. It\u2019s a big system getting the operators engaged and I think the U.S. system has begun to do that. So I would say that you\u2019ll see more of that in 2015. That probably is as specific as I would get on that one. I think that we also have if I look across Europe some very similar initiatives, some of the markets as I mentioned UK, Sweden are doing some testing on digital and again we just mentioned France where they are, Australia will be a little sooner on the digital lane, however that's 2015 as we look at that, latter part of '14 you will see some.  So that kind of gives you the digital perspective. The menu piece and reestablishing our leadership from a menu and marketing perspective, when we talk about milestones, the milestones I have for the priority market, so in Germany we had to reestablish our marketing function, we had to reestablish a more solid and balanced marketing plan and that is what the German team is working through now with the franchisees.  In Australia they are having some similar conversations and working through that aspect -- the balance between affordability core and the innovative nature of some of the new products. Clearly in the U.S we talked quite a bit about that, there is a sense of urgency, yes there are milestones relative to certain things. I have thoughts about everything from when certain changes occur. We're in the midst of the planning process now and so we're looking at the plans for 2015 as we move forward.  However we have not given up on 2014. We have a lot of activities now to show off the basis I've talked about and mentioned. So from a milestone perspective believe me they are there, they are aggressive, we talk about them routinely and we see them as we visit the marketplaces.  What we are mindful of John is the fact that we want to make sure that this is done again, so it has sustaining and staying power, which means in our system this has to be collaborative approach between ourselves and our franchisees. That's when things stay and last within -- in the McDonald\u2019s system. So I feel that it's moving in an appropriate direction. I am impatient as well. Believe me our senior team is, our operators are but we have to do this and do it in the right way so that we have long-term enduring profitable growth and not just a flash in the pan. But these are holistic solutions that will come together and I am confident they will drive the business over the long-term. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank. \nJason West - Deutsche Bank : Yeah, thanks. I guess just following up on lot of the other lines of questioning. You guys have obviously not been sitting on your hands in the last couple of years and you are seeing some progress in certain markets but overall some of these trends just seem to be getting worse. So I am just wondering if you feel you like have identified, why the traffic numbers are declining and you have much a better sense of that now than maybe you did a year ago. And yes the learning lab that you mentioned on the West Coast to help understand what customers want, kind of talk about how that's going to help you understand where the traffic is going and how to get people back in the stores? \nDon Thompson: Thanks for the question, Jason. When we talk about our learning lab, we have a learning lab in U.S. [inaudible], we have a digital function over in Europe and France, we had the architecture d\u00e9cor studio also over in France. So we've looked at -- and we have a lot of data on consumers and what consumers are looking for from a trend perspective. When we look at our base trend lines and why they move, where they move, why they would be [right] in these priority markets, we do today have a much better understanding of exactly why.  We've had a bit of an understanding in the past, however our actions have not coincided with the actual, I would say the data themselves. So when we put actions in place and we've heard some of the actions, what we're doing now is looking at what those consumer expectations are and putting together plans that are directly linked and related to those consumer expectations. That is what we're attempting to do. So this is not chasing short-term sales or short-term guest counts, we're looking to continue to have a sustainability to grew guest count sales and profitability.  So clearly there are things that we're looking at as we move forward and those are some of the initiatives as I've mentioned as we said on the problem. \nKathy Martin: Great. The next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. \nSara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Thank you very much. I want to jump over to maybe another part of world, just ask about China because I know you have called it out as a point of strength. It looked like maybe June slowed in China maybe pretty meaningfully. I wanted to ask about that trend and I assume it's unrelated to some of the negatives press we've seen but if you could just comment on both of those dynamics. As-well-as, I think Pete mentioned maybe some there is still a drag on margins from that kind of the lower margin and the mix there. Is that in anyway a function, I think of you having gone after more of a value message or is it just the sort of continued need to kind of scale up to see the margins kind of hit more system wide averages? \nPeter J. Bensen: Sara, it's Pete. I'll start on the margin in the APNEA and Don will talk more broadly about the trends in China. You know our APNEA margins over the next couple of quarters are going to be a little bit misleading because while we are seeing growth in individual countries so, the quarter and end year-to-date we\u2019ve seen growth in the margin in Australia, in China, in Hong Kong our three capital markets in APNEA, the fact that we have refranchised in Australia which is our highest from a capital margin percentage is changing the mix to a lower margin percentage in total and the fact that the Australian dollar is weaker when you translate that in to U.S. dollars that\u2019s giving even less weighting to Australia\u2019s high margins overall.  So that the segment, virtually all of the segment decline was as a result of these weighting and refranchising combinations. China itself grew margins in the quarter and year-to-date and the drag from the new stores was down significantly from a year ago. Now positive comps are clearly a driver of that but the team you may heard Dave Hoffmann and the team over there talk about the go-to-market strategy which is a very concentrated effort not only in China but in some of our other emerging markets to really look at the cost of opening the new restaurants and challenging the level of investment that we need today or can we build the restaurant with a little less cost today but build in such a way that we can expand it easily in the future when you know sales volumes dictate versus building the restaurant today for a sales volume that we might not achieve until five years from now.  So a much smarter approach, I would say to the development and we are starting to see some of those benefits already in our margins in China and Don can talk a little bit more broadly about the market.\nDon Thompson: Thanks Sara and thanks Pete. Actually in China Sara, our market, the market is performing solidly, quite solidly and I\u2019ll give you a little bit of background, little back drop on China relative to the economy and in our performance which actually if you look at our performance excluding the benefits of Avian influenza for the second quarter it still would have been positive. And over a two year perspective we are growing our business in China, we are growing market share in China, top ten markets, we\u2019re outpacing the competition in terms of growing market share. So we are growing solidly in China.  The macro-environment is still a challenge, there is fluctuating consumer sentiment and it\u2019s expected to carry over in the quarter. So IO visits are starting to recover a bit but it\u2019s a little bit lower then it was a year ago. I would tell you that despite that some of things we have talked about in some of the other markets actually bode true for China and we made those adjustments. So all day value we went from just a lunch time value to all day value platform, that continues to perform well. Again relative to Avian influenza we are comping on top of what the impact of that was, brand extensions are helping us to move forward. We focus on breakfast in China for the last several years, that continuing to be a positive contributor. Some of these things are even in the face of other initiatives that we implemented, some of the things we focused on with the night business last year.  So China is actually moving in a positive direction and we feel -- we feel solid about the performance in China. It is still a challenging economy however and everyone should realize that GDP is below 8% and we know what that means. There is still some acceleration in some of the operating related cost leverage of the labor as they look to normalize if you would or redistribute to some of the wealth across China. So everyone grows a bit. But they are still growing on [mobile], we are still growing dry fruits, our sites at the peak points are solid in terms of new sites that we\u2019re opening.  We culled some of the sites last year because we thought they may have been too early. I think [Kenneth] and the team has done a great job with that. So relative to China we are feeling again that the performance in China is solid.\nKathy Martin: Great. So we have six folks still in the queue. I know we are just about out of time. But we are going to take those six. So for those of you who can stay over for few minutes you know we will carry on. So next question is from Bryan Elliott from Raymond James.\nBryan Elliott - Raymond James: Good afternoon and thanks. Just as you look at the news this week out of China, are we at a tipping point, are you considering potentially backwardly integrating to protect your brand and what really are the solutions to the situation there, from a suppliers standpoint.\nDon Thompson: Hi Bryan. You know we have some very solid suppliers across the McDonald\u2019s system and they as we are committed to the highest standards of food safety for our customer. And that's always the number one priority. As we look at some of the alleged issues that are taking place now. If those things, clearly are confirmed at a level that we would think it is a higher level decision that has caused us to have a breach relative to consumer trust we would deal with that effectively, swiftly and appropriately.  We are no longer serving a product from the primary facility there, that has the challenges and the issues. I know that there is a couple of other facilities that they had, that have been cleared now by the Chinese government, the management thoroughly investigated. We are cooperating fully with the authorities. As you know we do have audits of our suppliers. In this case we do feel that we were a bit deceived relative to one of these plaints. So we are clearly looking at that.  What does it mean from a broader perspective relative to integration of the supply chain; we enjoy and have benefitted from what we call the three-legged stool which is the supply chain as a separate entity, just as our franchisees are a separate entity other than McDonalds Corporation. They bring us great innovation. They have grown with us in multiple countries around the world, they understand our expectations, they understand where we value consumer safety and our standards and they understand the fact that they would be under scrutiny if there is ever a challenge relative to our consumers. So we continue to make those points and we continue to drive forward to make sure that we protect our customers and protect the broader brand interest as we move forward on issues like this one.\nKathy Martin: Next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Hi great, thank you. Just some related U.S. topics if I may, I remember back in 2002 again I think actually using some franchise consultants, you really drove some QSC in the franchisees and either showed them a path to measurable improvement at the store level or showed them a path to exiting the system. So at what point are you kind of like in another phase in terms of kind of getting a 20 year commitment out of franchisees and making sure you have the right people on board with you? And the second kind of I think related topic is around the effectiveness and the efficiency of our advertising and your product development. It does seem to be lagging your peers even a fraction of the size. So I was wondering if there was a structural opportunity to change the effectiveness and the speed to market of that advertising and product development in the U.S. or whether it's just I think as I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s just about improving executional tactics. Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Right, John thanks for the question. Relative to the franchises and John we have a lot of collaboration and committees that are shared between the franchises and the company and our suppliers. So as we engage and address the business we move forward, we are -- we have a lot of communication with each other. One of those points of communications clearly every year is around operating standards of McDonald and what we call growth criteria and also the restaurant operation improvement process which is really focused on quality, food quality, service and cleanliness in the restaurants and we've had a clearly a lot of conversations about how and when and where, and what the processes are for abiding by that.  We still have those processes in place. Those processes started back to your point in 2001-\u20182 timeframe. They are in place everything from a process for improvement for those restaurants that are not performing at the appropriate levels to how we look at franchise engagement, how we look at our own company operated restaurant performance. So we don't need to have a separate initiative and I think as you talked about it was almost I got a sense of an upper out kind of a conversation. We have ongoing conversation with each other relative to the performance of our restaurants and clearly are we having those now? Yes we are, we have them all the time.  But what's important is that we focus on the standards and adherence to the standard not some kind of a process to move franchises out of the business. We have a process and frankly based on our improvement processes we tend to be able to improve the business in a different way. We are no more or less aggressive than we were in 2002 at this point in time. It is very similar.  Relative to marketing, there is a focus on marketing effectiveness. You are absolutely right as we look at shareholder voice, as we look at the impact that our creative has, as we look at the reach that, that creative has and we look at the distribution outlets and our media allocation. Having said that, there is also a focus on how our marketing messages are conveying the emotional quotient if you would of the brand and that means there has to be changes.  So when I mentioned leadership changes in marketing or agency changes those are not incremental effectiveness changes John, those are changes based upon the fact that we may not be getting the content or the reach or the awareness that we desire and demand as a McDonald\u2019s brand. And when we make those changes we don\u2019t do it lightly. Those are the kind of changes that we need to drive the business and those changes are occurring in several of our critical markets around the world. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from [RJ Hardwe] from Morningstar. \nUnidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to dive down into Europe a little bit more. Looks like the June results the negative 3.4% comp, little bit softer than what we\u2019ve seen, Europe had recently been a point of relative outperformance. Just wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything more than this just the things you mentioned in Germany between the marketing changes there as well as the Russia situation going on, whether are you seeing competition intensify or seeing less impact from reimagining or some of the menu innovations there, just kind of want to get a better sense of your perspective on Europe. \nDon Thompson: Thanks RJ. I think you hit it pretty well. Germany still remains weak and showed further deceleration in the second quarter. As I mentioned our teams and the franchisees and the changes we\u2019ve made in terms of leadership and process those things are moving forward. It\u2019s going to take a while in Germany. We have lost share in that market. If I look at France and the UK those markets are gaining share and our performance has been solid and we had similar conversations about France several years, could we make the turn and some of the things that we put in place in France has proved [inaudible] on the affordability and we\u2019ve added great balance across the menu in terms of the core product. We\u2019ve has new innovations, we\u2019ve added digital strategies that have been implemented.  So those things are even in a very-very tough environment our business in France is still providing and so I think it goes to show all the things that we\u2019re talking about are not just things that we dream up but they are the things that we have implemented in the markets around the world. So France is still performing, UK is performing as we mentioned they just last lapped on top of the blended ice rollout but we still have a solid performance there, a very balanced approach to the business and we\u2019re still moving forward and growing.  There has been one thing we\u2019ve seen a little bit of decline in retail footfall traffic but aside from that, RJ nothing I would say was much broader than that point. Russia slowdown in comp sales there, the economy has recently entered a recession. It\u2019s taking a hit based upon the geopolitical issues, they are paired there. There is lower consumer confidence.  We have seen some new competitors enter the market but as you know that is a market that we have been in a market that we\u2019re growing in and growing with the right crews and we feel very good about our positioning there and the opportunities in front of us in Russia but at this point there is -- we are seeing some softness in Russia. I think largely due to some of the geopolitical concerns and consumer confidence. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from [Howard Penny from Hagi]. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hi thank you very much. Don the last time you\u2019ve gone through an extended period of declining same store sales it took a much bigger event and a major sort of restructuring to get, to realign the organization. I know you put forth the plans to improve sales and you believe I honestly believe that you think you believe you\u2019ve got the right plans but the fact of matter is you might not have the right plan and there could be some give and take and it might not work as you\u2019ve laid it out. Do you have a contingency plan or back-up plan to what might not work or what you put forth today and what are the chances do you think that an extended period of sales will lead to a bigger sort of effort to improve your top line sales? Thanks very much. \nDon Thompson: Thanks for the question, Howard. I know you and I talked recently when we were together at the investor meeting last year, some of the basic fundamental things that we talked about are things that we\u2019re focused on now, to shore up the business clearly. Relative to contingencies, it is the great thing about the McDonald\u2019s system is we are in 119 countries. We have a very diverse portfolio of [witnesses], so we have the opportunity to test multiple things in parts of initiatives in different areas of the world. So when I talk about the digital strategy part of the test was taken place in France.  What we\u2019re implementing as a result of those learnings in Australia, what subsets of that are being tested in the Sweden, and the U.S. and the UKs of the world, really as we formulate these strategies we\u2019re constantly, I guess you\u2019d say iterating around the improvements in the data that we\u2019ve seen in several markets. So relative to the contingencies I guess I would say it\u2019s almost a live in contingency as to the way that we implement major initiatives. So the digital initiative being one, the customization and personalization efforts being another, even on those it maybe based upon a different product complement.  So in the U.S it's going to be about Burger leadership, many markets across Europe it will be about that initially. There are other areas where it would be the chicken platforms and portfolios. So we're learning as we go. Outside of focusing -- the things that we're focused on are we know we have to get much better at and they are also areas that we believe great opportunity for us. So the whole notion of the respected brand and our sustainability based efforts and how things play out, not only have we've done some of those historically but most people don't know about them and we have to even get that even more accelerated. So we know that, that's something our customers want and it bodes well relative to our business plan.  What we're doing around customization and food it goes right at what consumer are asking us for across demographic tiers and so we know they are the right things to do. I would tell you Howard the broader question that is out there now and the broader question that we're answering in the local markets is around what we do to shore up the foundation now even in these environments, even in these economies, even with the other cash flow impact points that maybe out there, how we ensure that together we move to show off the base, so we're ready for the incremental customers that will come and we build up our peak periods and so that kind of is the foundation of it.  We have to -- your point it's almost an evolving contingency plan. And believe me there are several other areas that we're looking at outside of the ones that I mentioned but those are the ones that we know would be a solid part of our future growth strategy. \nKathy Martin: Next question is from Keith Siegner from UBS. \nKeith Siegner - UBS: Thank you very much. I'd like to circle back to a question on the consumer insights from earlier and maybe just ask you in a different way especially given how much attention this got at the November Analyst Day last year. Forgetting the plan for a second, just looking at that data that you are collecting which I understand is pretty robust. The customers who aren't coming as much or maybe aren't coming these days, why are they saying that's the case. I mean what are they highlighting and kind of how has that evolved as the year progress. Is it a lack of compelling new news, is helpfulness or quality in general coming up more often, is it the -- what are the folks not coming actually saying in the data? Thanks. \nDon Thompson: Well, Keith that's a big question for a global brand. \nKeith Siegner - UBS: Just the U.S. \nDon Thompson: If you look into U.S., there are several things that we see in the U.S. You all know that the QSR industry as a whole is soft in the U.S. There are a lot of things that are out there in the U.S. right now ranging from as I've mentioned some of the legislative matters that are on the board relative to impact of healthcare next year, potential minimal wage changes, what happens relative to the immigration reform cost particularly around [inaudible]. There are challenges and changes relative to legislation in terms of whether or not there will be re-ups on some of the tax credits, tax benefits. So there are a lot of things that our franchisees are looking at relative to cash flow.  That is one of the things that then flows through relative to execution in the restaurant. When we first began operations reset we were hearing some customers at the restaurants were getting too complicated, it was a little confusing on the menu boards. We needed to get some level of simplification. I would say at the same time we're saying and customers are saying we want a little more customization or personalization but we want some different taste. We want some different condiments, the U.S. is moving forward with the high density kitchen and prep for that.  We're also hearing that there are some consumer confidence related concerns around discretionary spending. In the U.S. we see a bifurcation based upon what's taking place in markets that are greater than $75,000 from an overall income perspective and those that are less than say $45,000. These are two different worlds today. Those markets at the higher end discretionary spending are still flowing fairly well, markets at the lower end it's a little bit tighter.  The geographic positioning of McDonald\u2019s around the U.S. is broad and so we're in both of those sub markets and pretty good distribution. That's a little different than some of our competitor set. So clearly the economy is a bit of a concern and we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and that improvement will be across all segments. But we also have to make sure that we're thriving in this environment, so having the right affordability messaging which maybe slightly different in some of these markets than it is in others. \nKathy Martin: All right. Our last question is from Paul Westra from Stifel. \nPaul Westra - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.:  Great. Thanks. Very similar question to Keith's about the U.S business. Maybe talk a little bit about more if you could about the weakness perhaps in the overall U.S. QSR category and specifically do you sense any incremental competitive challenges coming from the convenient store business which you mentioned before and the low end perhaps and perhaps quick casual on the high end. I know this year emphasis is on the increasing frequency of the base business and perhaps base consumer, the ones have stabilized perhaps talk a little bit about the more intermediate term opportunity or product line expansions maybe -- or maybe regain some share from these lower end and higher end categories?\nDon Thompson:   Yeah, Paul. I would tell you that several years ago we began to have conversations just around broader market segments and sets and what we were seeing. I would tell anyplace a person can stop we view as a competitor whether it\u2019s a petrol station or it\u2019s a convenience store, it\u2019s a grocery store, ready to eat food or take home food we view the whole set a competitor. As we look at our business when you got that many places that you can view as a competitor what you have to focus on is what you are good at and what you know you can excel at and differentiate.  We know that the speed of service at McDonald's, the accuracy of the service, the food quality even in our segment which is a quick service restaurant segment are critically important. The transparency of our food and the fact that we know that we have very high quality food at McDonald's is one of the messages that I think we have to get out even stronger and it\u2019s one of the things that the overall quick service industry has struggled with for years and years and years. And so we believe that some of things that we have talked about from many personalization, customization high density kitchens, highlighting some of the condiments on the prep table those things also help us, but it also had to be spread throughout our marketing and our awareness campaigns, those are the things that we are focused on and make sure that those things take place.  You know as you look at food away from home right now we know that the food away from home industry is one of that is still increasing albeit about a two percentile rate, interestingly enough food at home is 2.4% increase. So they\u2019re all in the ball park of normalization I guess I call it normal inflation at this point in time. If one of those shoots up or down we have to take note of it relative to what that meets to our affordability platforms. If the economy gets better or worse we have note of that relative to what impact it may have on our breakfast business. So, there is a lot of things we look at. I couldn\u2019t give you Paul you know super specifics on any one item but there is a lot of things we have to look as we mentioned in the business particularly in the U.S. and go forward.\nKathy Martin:   Okay, thanks. And we are going to go right into Don\u2019s closing comments.\nDon Thompson:  Thank you all very much. We wanted to take a little extra time because we know you have questions, interest relative to the McDonald's business. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We remain committed as you can tell to the Plan on Win and our strategic growth priorities as we work to strengthen the key foundational elements of our business and I have mentioned how critical those are. We know that we can drive our business through the growth initiatives that will enhance our customers relative to the field. We are seeing that in some of the markets around the world. Those initiatives and implementations will be broader as we move forward.  Our defensible competitive advantages, our resilient business model, the communications and alignment that we strive for and have with owner operators, our suppliers and company teams, those things give me confidence that as we execute our plans to drive profitable growth for our system we will be successful and our shareholders will reap the benefits of that over the long-term. So thanks again for joining us this morning. Have a great day everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s call and at this time you may disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-04-22 17:29:05", "content": "Executives: Kathy Martin - VP of Investor Relations Don Thompson - President and CEO Pete Bensen - Chief Financial Officer \nAnalysts:  Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer John Glass - Morgan Stanley Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo David Tarantino - Baird David Palmer - RBC Jason West - Deutsche Bank Will Slabaugh - Stephens Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Alex Chan - Jefferies \nOperator: Hello and welcome to the McDonald\u2019s April 22, 2014 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.\nKathy Martin: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson and our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also applies to our comments. And these documents are both available on our website at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are any reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. For now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don.\nDon Thompson: Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone. We began 2014 with our strategies and our business miles sound and intact. From a financial standpoint, our system\u2019s number one goal remains enduring profitable growth, which starts with continuing to grow customer visits and comparable sales. From our diversified geographic portfolio that leverages the entrepreneurial power of local ownership to the breadth of our menu across day parts and meal occasions, our strategies, infrastructure, and investments support this goal. And while we expect the market dynamics to remain similar to 2013, we do have experienced effectively competing in challenging operating environments and I remain confident in our ability to be successful at McDonald\u2019s. Our global growth priorities are focused on ensuring that we remain relevant and appealing, so that more customers will visit us more often. We\u2019re focused on optimizing our menu so that we offer our customers food and drinks that have strong appeal, on modernizing the customer experience in our restaurants, so that that experience for each customer is more memorable; and on broadening accessibility so that we deliver on unparalleled convenience. The key to our growth lies in our ability to place the customer at the center of everything that we do. Over the past few months, I had the opportunity to visit our priority markets, the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia with Steve Easterbrook, Pete Benson and Tim Fenton. We focused on more deeply understanding how each of those markets are adjusting their plans to address current challenges and adapt to the environment and to our customers\u2019 expectations. There were four opportunities that were common to these markets and are being fortified in many other countries in which we operate. First, we're strengthening our planning process to more effectively bridge consumer insights into the right customer center plans and actions, while striking the right balance against our internal financial objectives. Second, we're strengthening our marketing messaging to better resonate with customers and create stronger awareness. Third, we're enhancing our affordability platforms to ensure our value offers are consistent and clearly message. We want our customers to feel good about the value that they get when they visit us at McDonald\u2019s. And finally, we're more effectively balancing our focus on the core menu including the Big Mac, Egg McMuffin and our world famous fries. Our core products are familiar favorites for our customers. They truly represent McDonald\u2019s to all of our customers and at about 40% of total sales, they are an incredible business asset for us that requires a constant drumbeat of communication. Now our area of the world our local market teams are translating these learnings along with specific market findings into comprehensive action plans to improve the customer experience. A good example is the recent changes made in U.S. marketing to more directly align our marketing efforts with targeted consumer segments. I\u2019ll talk more about this change and actions being taken in the other priority markets a little bit later. It\u2019s important to underscore that it will take time for consumers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits. This is not about a silver bullet; rather it\u2019s about optimally sequencing multiple customer focus initiatives and executing them very well. While, we expect results in these core markets to remain volatile in the near-term, we are confident in our ability to improve overtime. Now beyond our priority markets, we continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives that drive system wide performance. In addition to our ongoing emphasis on menu, these include brand extensions like McCaf\u00e9 beverages, desert kiosks and delivery; they include increasing our global footprint through new restaurant opening in both established and emerging markets and by continuing to modernize our restaurants through reimaging. And also by leveraging the investments that we have already made in the restaurants, particularly relative to restaurant technology like our global point of sell platform and in-store wireless access to support our digital efforts focused on engaging more deeply with our customers and differentiating the McDonald\u2019s experience. Finally in addition to market level activities, we are also evaluating opportunities to enhance shareholder value, while maintaining long-term financial strength. Now Pete, will speak more about this area of focus in his comments. Let me switch gears now and discuss global results. Year-to-date March our global comparable sales increased 50 basis points with positive performance in all segments except the U.S. Operating income was up 1% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.21, a 2% decrease in constant currencies. Comparable guest counts for the quarter continue to be negative. Our priority markets of the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia drove that decline. Comparable guest counts would have been positive excluding those markets, while recent signs indicate economies maybe stabilizing several of our major markets, the projections for the informal eating out industry call for flat to modest growth in 2014. With this as a backdrop, April global comparable sales are expected to be modestly positive. Let\u2019s now move to performance by area of the world and address our priorities going forward. In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.7% and operating income declined 3% driven by negative guest counts due impart to severe winter weather. The U.S. is focused on strengthening the customer experience through better operations and service execution, balanced focus between our core and new products and enhancing marketing effectiveness, while maximizing our opportunities to grow our breakfast. Because service is such a foundational element of the customer experience, we recognized the need to elevate our service levels to ultimately build visits. During the first six months of this year, our franchise and company-owned restaurants are engaged in what we call a reset, which emphasizes the importance of proper staffing, scheduling and positioning of crew to build restaurant capacity, particularly during peak hours. Now early I mentioned changes that have been made within our U.S. marketing group. We\u2019ve adjusted our marketing calendar so that we are introducing the appropriate number of new and promotional products. And we are better sequencing them to maximize restaurant execution and the contribution to comparable sales. We are also looking to harness the power of our marketing strength especially in support of our core menu. We are focused on creating a greater emotional connection between customers and our core products through our advertising and media spend. Those things combined with the fresh perspective of our new U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, these balanced menu changes and focused media strategies will allow us to strengthen our appeal to customers by offering them what they truly want, great food and great service at an affordable price. Finally, as the leader of the important and growing breakfast day part, we\u2019ll continue to build on the strength of our morning business. Today customers choose McDonald's because of our great product, cooked in our restaurants and our kitchens. We grab fresh eggs, we grill sausage and bake it, we bake biscuits and we toast muffins, all to serve up a delicious breakfast that is accompanied by our outstanding McCafe coffee. These things truly set us apart and position us to continue growing this day part into the future. Now moving over to Europe. Comparable sales were up 1.4% for the quarter and operating income was up 4% in constant currency. Positive comparable sales performance in the UK, France and Russia was partially offset by Germany\u2019s negative results. While we\u2019re encouraged by positive comparable sales trends and recent economic indicators that appear to be stabilizing in many markets across Europe, we remained cautious in the near-term, given a tenuous operating environment. Both the UK and Russia have successfully focused on growing breakfast, while balancing the core menu with strong promotional activity that is resonating with local customers. In France, successful marketing support for premium products and limited time offers along with the stronger affordability platform have contributed to the 8th consecutive month of positive comparable sales growth amid of declining IEO industry. Germany is one of the priority markets with persistent negative sales and guest count momentum. The new management team is working to rebuild consumer trust through a more relevant and consistent affordability platform. We\u2019ve also adjusted our menu and marketing calendar to do a better job of connecting with customers, by reducing and better balancing our core menu favorites with new food and beverage offers. Now let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comparable sales were up 80 basis points for the quarter and operating income decreased 2% in constant currencies. Solid comparable sales performance in China and many other markets was somewhat offset by weakness in Japan and to a lesser extent Australia. In China, comparable sales increased 6.6% for the quarter, partly reflecting the lap of the residual effects of consumer sensitivity related to last year\u2019s supply chain issue in the chicken industry. China\u2019s ongoing focus on brand extensions like delivery and dessert kiosks is strengthening our appeal as a convenient brand. Sales from our delivery business continue to grow at a double-digit pace. And while about 30% of the total restaurants in China offer delivery, these restaurants are concentrated in our key cities and offer additional customer benefits such as minimum delivery times and 24-hour service. We continue to see significant growth potential throughout APMEA. In China, we plan to open about 300 new restaurants this year. We also continue to accelerate our franchising efforts; about 15% of restaurants in China are franchised as of the end of the quarter and we are on track to achieve our mid-term target of 20% to 25% franchise restaurants. In Australia, recent comparable sales are negative due in part to the shift and timing of the monopoly promotion this year. The market is enhancing its affordability platform by adding new meal bundles to the Loose Change menu to strengthen our value offer and remind customers that we have something for everyone. Japan continues to experience negative comparable sales in guest count trends amid a highly competitive environment. Looking ahead, Japan is focused on offering more relevant food and beverage choices, increasing the focus on the family business and repositioning the affordability platform to rebuild our customer connection and stabilize our performance. As we look forward, the market is also monitoring consumer reaction to the 3% consumption tax increase that occurred on April 1st. Around the world, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our actions are driven by what our customers want and need from us today and tomorrow. As our business continues to generate significant levels of cash, our philosophy regarding the use of cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business to capitalize on the sizeable long-term growth opportunities that exist. And after reinvesting in the business, we\u2019re committed to returning all of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases combined. I want to close by reemphasizing my confidence in McDonald\u2019s future. Approximately 70 million customers per day across a geographically diverse portfolio of over 35,000 restaurants is a very strong foundation from which we operate. Our infrastructure and our fundamentals are sound. We\u2019re leveraging the power of our proven business model, our investments in restaurant capabilities and modernization and our hard earned competitive advantages to pursue the sizable opportunities that are before us. At the same time, we\u2019re thoughtfully evolving our approach to remain relevant, making appropriate adjustments to navigate near term challenges while driving enduring profitable growth for our system and for our shareholders over the long term. Thanks again everyone, and I will now turn it over to Pete.\nPete Bensen: Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The McDonald\u2019s system entered the year with the realistic view of our near term opportunities get a firm focus on our path to long term success. We are diligently managing those things within our control while continuing to position the McDonald\u2019s system for future growth. The battle for market share is expected to persist given projections for flat to modest category growth in our major markets this year. But over the long term the $1.2 trillion global and formal leading out category should grow more significantly, and I expect McDonald\u2019s to fully participate in that growth. One of the reasons I am confident in McDonald\u2019s future is the strong phase off of which we operate. First quarter results were in line with our expectations and highlighted the resiliency of our system and financial model. Though top line growth was challenged, McDonald\u2019s generated $1.9 billion of operating income. This is an impressive number. But I am even more encouraged by the significant long term opportunities we see to drive future growth. Turning to first quarter performance. We are primarily a franchiser with 81% of our global restaurants franchised; as such our profitability is driven primarily by top line performance. Modest comparable sales growth combined with higher expenses and lower gains from sales of restaurants contributed to a 60 basis point decline in our combined operating margin to 28.9% through March. The largest component of operating income is our franchise margins, representing approximately 70% of total restaurant margin dollars, franchise margins which are driven by a relatively steady and predictable stream of rent and royalties grew to approximately $1.8 billion in the first quarter, a 3% constant currency increase driven primarily by expansion. The consolidated franchise margin percent decreased 60 basis points to 81.1%, highlighting the need for stronger comparable sales gains to offset increased expenses and maintain this margin percent. Global company operated margin dollars grew to $723 million while the margin percent decreased 10 basis points to 16.1% due to higher labor, commodity and occupancy cost which were offset by positive comparable sales. In the U.S. company operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.3% as the positive impact from higher average check primarily driven by pricing was offset by negative guest counts and higher commodity and crew labor costs. First quarter commodity cost in the U.S. rose nearly 3% driven primarily by higher protein cost. We expect similar pressure in second quarter than easing throughout the second half of the year. The full year outlook for the U.S. grocery basket remains a 1% to 2% increase. At the end of March the price increase in the U.S. was about 3% higher versus a year ago. While the food away from home inflation index is 2.3% through March, it is projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year. In addition we have seen more significant increases over the past two months in food at home inflation which is also projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year. We watch these indices closely, yet are also mindful of cost pressures not only in 2014 but next year as well, when making our pricing decisions. Turning to Europe, company operated margins increased 30 basis points to 17%, as strong performance in France and the UK was partially offset by higher commodity costs in Russia due to the impact of the weaker Russian ruble on import cost. Europe\u2019s grocery bill was relatively flat in the first quarter and we expect more pressure in the second half of the year with the full year increase still projected at 1% to 2%. And across Europe, the average menu price increase excluding Russia is about 2%. In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins declined 60 basis points to 14% as positive comparable sales were offset by higher labor, occupancy, and other costs, while the margin percent grew in several markets including China and Australia refranchising in Australia and the weaker Australian dollar negatively impacted the segment\u2019s overall margin percentage. In addition, the new restaurant openings primarily in China contributed to the lower margin percent, though to a lesser extent than in 2013. G&A for the quarter increased 4% in constant currencies. Over half of this increase was due to our sponsorship of the Winter Olympic and parallel Olympic games in Sochi. We expect to experience a more significant G&A increase next quarter due to our worldwide convention and cost related to other initiatives such as restaurant growth, capacity enhancements and our digital capabilities. First quarter effective tax rate was 32.4% and represented a significant increase versus the prior year rate of 30.1% which was aided by a tax benefit of nearly $50 million. We continue to project the 2014 full year rate to be between 31% and 33%. We [already] committed to investing in our business to drive future growth and returns, we allocate capital in a discipline measured way opening new units across a diversified portfolio of markets, while making prudent investments in existing restaurants. We are on track to open 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 in affiliated and developmental licensee markets. We also expect to reimage over a 1,000 existing restaurants. The rollout of the new kitchen equipment in the U.S. is progressing nicely and we are on track to have it installed in all restaurants by mid-year. As I discussed at a couple of investor conferences last month, we are moving with more urgency to address recent financial performance in our priority markets. In addition to these efforts which Don covered we're actively looking at ways to improve shareholder returns by optimizing our capital structure, while maintaining our long term financial strength; optimizing our ownership structure including certain refranchising activities especially in markets outside of the U.S. and scrutinizing ongoing G&A while appropriately supporting our franchisees and our growth initiatives. As I said at the conferences these additional areas of focus do not represent a change in strategy or financial philosophy, they fit squarely within our business model. We are not beginning with a given target in any of these areas, but instead are evaluating them with the ultimate screen of creating value by doing what is right for the business over the long-term. Financial discipline has been a cornerstone of a plan to win and that certainly will continue because I believe a strong financial foundation is a critical component to building enduring profitable growth. It's premature to comment on any specifics, but we expect to provide an update on our progress over the next couple of months. Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. At current rates including the stronger euro, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally impacted with a full year negative impact of about $0.03 to $0.04. As usual, this is directional guidance only, because I know rates will change as we move throughout the year. In closing, I'm confident in our fundamental business model and our competitive position. We're the global leader in a $1.2 trillion industry, yet have less than 8% market share providing significant opportunity for future growth. Our geographically diversified portfolio and various ownership structures allow us to optimize our investments within a market. We are aligned with our outstanding owner operators and suppliers to leverage our distinct competitive advantages. And we are making strategic investments today to seize those opportunities to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and the entire McDonald\u2019s system. Thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.\nOperator: Thanks Pete. We\u2019re going to open the call now for analysts and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). So, our first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Could you give us a little bit more color on the U.S. kitchen assembly prep tables, maybe how many stores have them currently and I know you said you expected the rollout to be complete by mid-year, but also in addition to the number, since what you\u2019ve learned so far in terms of speed to service or greater product assortment to variety?\nDon Thompson: Hi Joe, this is Don. Just a little bit on the prep tables. The high density prep tables and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about relative to the kitchen changes in the U.S. are really, they are key enabler for the future menu and the reason that they are is that they give us a few things we don\u2019t have today. One of those being room to add more ingredients another being [material well] which enables us to include fresh ingredients. It also helps us relative to the way that the kitchens are structured so that we have a mere image of time and it\u2019s on both sides of our preparation table. And we won\u2019t have to ergonomically; you won\u2019t have to reach across the table for our crew to be able to prepare some of our foods, our sandwiches and our products. These things together really help support our future vision of the menu and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we are going to add a lot of things, but what it does means is it gives us the capability to optimize some of the products we have and it gives us the flexibility to have some new toppings that will help us to be able to customize some of the food products that we have. The U.S. is on track to meet its completion goal by mid-year and it\u2019s going quite well. In addition to that Joe, the other thing that the U.S. is doing now and I mentioned it in my comments is what we call is reset, which is focusing back on staffing and scheduling and positioning. This is really, really critical because at this point in time and with the volumes that we have in the restaurant, we want to make sure that we can handle the peak hour capacities that hit the restaurants. And so, a combination of those things with the way that we\u2019re rationalizing the menu to make sure we are not implementing too many new products with a better balance of focusing on the core and new products those things all together are really what this major focus in the U.S. is right now and it\u2019s kind of a back to the basics with some enhancements in terms of our productivity and capability in the restaurants.\nOperator:  Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer:  Thank you. It just feels like the biggest opportunity here in the near-term is Europe, it\u2019s 40% of profit contribution very similar to the U.S. and your operating profit did decline in the U.S. and APMEA, but it was positive 6% in Europe and I think this was despite your largest European market Germany being negative. And so, just focus on Germany for a second, tell us really what you think is going on that can help turnaround some of those self inflected balloons in that country? And really I just feel if Germany gets turn Europe can really accelerate from here and therefore the profits of the company can really accelerate from here. So, if you could just focus on Germany for a moment that will be helpful?\nDon Thompson:  Absolutely Brian, so a couple of things in a broader set. As we talked about the key priority markets and I mentioned some of things that we saw relative to commonalities. And those things really are what I will consider to be a translation of consumer insights into the action plans very strong and making sure that we are not trying to merely drive profitability on the end, but we\u2019re focused on customers and the insights around customers. There are several things relative to Germany and these things are being addressed now by the leadership team that\u2019s there. One is Germany is a very price sensitive market. And if we look at our performance, we have a couple of main issues; one being our core EVM movement and from a competitive perspective actually the bakeries in Germany are doing quite well. What customers have mentioned to us is that there is several things that we need to focus on; one is to reestablish our relevance because our menu boards have done a little bit out of whack. What I mean by that we\u2019ve implemented a lot of new products similar to some of the implementations in the U.S. system and it really has confused customers to a certain extent. The other thing has to do with our pricing and our strategic relationship on the menu board. And this basically is the relationship between the value-based components and the rest of the limited time offers and the core EVMs. We\u2019ve got to make sure that there is a much more rational and strategic pricing structure our teams are working on that. And lastly is the balancing of marketing and that is the balance between our core menu that I\u2019ve talked about with Big Macs, Royales or Quarters, fries, how we leverage and talk about those things along with value along with limited time offers, offers like the (inaudible) products in Germany. And so, the combination of having a consistent balance there with having a consistent messaging around affordability and also making sure that we reestablished the relevance particularly with the offers we convey via our menu boards and marketing are the things the market\u2019s focused on. As we were having our session in Germany it\u2019s clear that the new leadership team that we have in place there is focused on these things. We also had a chance to meet with the franchisees in the Germany. They are very understanding of the situation that we\u2019re in there. And frankly one of the things that galvanizes McDonald\u2019s system is when you have poor performance and an impacted cash flow. And I know that our franchisees along with our company team there and it is a new team are all focused on improving the situation there and improving our aggressiveness in the marketplace.\nOperator:  Next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Pete when you talked about optimizing the business model little more, can you of the three big buckets you\u2019ve outlined, which do you think is going to have the biggest impact or potentially the biggest impact to shareholder returns? And can you talk about how you plan to convey this information, is it in next quarter or is it inter-quarter and is this the whole plan or is it just kind of an update, we\u2019ll get a lot of these updates along the way?\nPete Bensen:  All right, good question John. I think you have to take -- the three levers that I mentioned, you really have to take those in combination with what Don said in his comments about the focus on the four priority markets. So, taking all of that together is really, the combination of all of that is what\u2019s going to drive the value over the long-term for shareholders and the system, not anyone of those items in isolation. And as Don mentioned, to turn the sales trends line in those big markets, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. And so, as we look at what else is there within our business model that in the meantime we can do to be accretive to value, looking at opportunities on the balance sheet as we said though we want to maintain that single A rating that\u2019s been a cornerstone of our business model over the last 50 plus years and is an important piece of our financial strength and flexibility. Refranchising; at 81% franchised obviously that\u2019s our primary method of doing business. While we\u2019ve done refranchising over the last couple of years, we think there is opportunities to accelerate that. And so, of the financial lever, that's probably the one that has the most opportunity to drive value. And that by its nature is going to be a multi-year plan when we talk about the details. It's going to be a multi-year plan and it's really primarily focused outside the U.S. And, but it's also prudent for us to take a look at our G&A spend especially as we know there are growth opportunities in areas like digital where we want to allocate more funds and rather than have all of that be incremental, we're looking for ways to reallocate so that we can finance those and live within a certain G&A envelope. So, you can expect to hear from us by the end of the second quarter. And I think what you'd expect to hear is something broadly that covers kind of all of those areas and not just one or two of the specifics.\nOperator: Next question is from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer - Wells Fargo: Great, thanks. Good morning. What are the opportunities you see at breakfast? Have you increasingly focused on a day part as a potential same-store sales driver? It seems like it's been, your attention there has been up to a little bit here recently?\nDon Thompson: Thanks Jeff. First of all relative to breakfast, I mentioned in my comments, customers choose breakfast at McDonald\u2019s because our breakfast tastes great. It has very, very high consumer score, freshly prepared products every morning as I mentioned, we actually crack eggs, we cook in our restaurants. This is not a microwave deal, we actually cook. We have grills and fryers and ovens. And so that's the reason that we're able to prepare breakfast. The other thing is our breakfast model is also focused on how we serve up that breakfast, quickly the customers that are on the go. And so, we continue to focus on those areas of strength that we have. And we have been serving breakfast now for over 30 years and it is our strongest, one of our strongest dayparts clearly, clearly one of the strongest from a profitability perspective, the strongest. And so we will continue to focus on our breakfast opportunities. The U.S. is focused today primarily on breakfast be a coffee and then our handheld sandwiches that we have at breakfast and also on some of the quality and freshness use that I have just talked about. And so those things will continue to focus on, continue to focus on the operational opportunities we have there in staffing and the scheduling and positioning of breakfast as well.\nOperator: Next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.\nDavid Tarantino - Baird: Hi, good morning. Just one quick clarification on the last question, then a separate question. First, on the breakfast sort of initiative or focus there; is that being done in response to this competitive activity, for example, the Taco Bell launch and maybe could you comment on whether that is having an impact on your business or not? And then the second question comes back to the focus on the reset initiative in the U.S. And it sounds like maybe some of the initiative there is focused on better handling the complexity, but one of the things that you haven\u2019t talked about is whether you\u2019d be interested in reducing some of the menu complexity to sort of fine-tune the operations and whether or not that\u2019s an opportunity; so perhaps could you comment on that as well? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Thanks David. Just a couple of points, one is there has been breakfast competition for a number of years in the U.S. market. And we\u2019ve had some of our major competitors that may run at breakfast and seems every year there is a someone new that is making a run and none of them have really stopped their focus on breakfast, whether that\u2019d will be the closer end and competitors or if that\u2019s sandwich shops or that\u2019s taco shops or anything else. Everyone has an opportunity and they wanted to look at breakfast. We have not seen an impact relative to the most recent competitors that entered the space. One of the things that happens at breakfast if anyone enters, customers would try the breakfast that it\u2019s new, it will be something that they have not seen in the marketplace. So we expect customers to try. But what we also are confident in is our ability to execute at breakfast with again the things that I mentioned relative to being a restaurant to cooks and we have a delivery service that\u2019s capable of satisfying the time need if you would of consumers. I think that new entrants into the market always bring a different level of attention to breakfast which in many cases supports us. Our breakfast continues to be a positive driver in our business in the U.S. And actually sometimes when these entrants come in, it forces us to focus even more on being aggressive relative to breakfast. I know you have just recently seen the coffee execution in the U.S. and our free coffee offers which really are about supporting our breakfast and supporting our breakfast foods as much as they are about reintroducing Americans to a delicious cup of McCafe coffee. So those are the things we do there. On the reset end, I did mention in my comments a bit about reducing, potentially this reduces the complexity. When you have a number of builds in the restaurant, basically what you are doing is you are leveraging the various condiments and products in the restaurant to build those sandwiches. If you can go to a more streamlined menu board approach and then still have those comments or condiments, so the customers can customize a bit,, it will help in terms of reducing if you will, complexity. Having said that though, customers want very taste. And so we need to be able to deliver that. They also want familiar favorites like the Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, Filet-O-Fish, Nuggets price and we need to be able to deliver on that. And we will be able to do both of those things the system that the U.S. is putting in place on reset just calls us back to a basic operations focus on our restaurant. And it helps us to enable better productivity with some of the things such as the high-density prep table and the high-density kitchen set as we have.\nOperator: Next question is from David Palmer from RBC.\nDavid Palmer - RBC: Good morning. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you\u2019re strengthening your planning process to effectively bridge consumer insights with the right customer centric plans and marketing. I am curious about what that means, have we already seen the fruits of these changes in your marketing, are big changes coming soon, perhaps you can give us a sense of what you think is the marketing opportunity after some self diagnosis? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Several different points, thanks David for the question, several points mentioned. On the consumer insights, we have tremendous amounts of data within the McDonald's system. Question is whether the data is then being translated directly to the specific action plans that we see being executed in the marketplace. And that is a combined effort between the franchisees and the market our leadership teams and our supply chain and our supply chain leaders. So we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re translating those consumer insights. The whole notion here is that you can\u2019t be driven based upon optimizing profitability, even in the face of external pressures relative to the P&L. We still got to remain grounded in the consumers and that is what we saw at some slight gaps on the priority market. So we\u2019ve got to get back to that consumer focus while mindful of some of these additional cost pressures to make sure that the plans are robust enough. But that is combined with several other things that I mentioned, one is the marketing messages. So if we are more streamlined and focused relative to this consumer insights to action plan, then the marketing focus and the messages won\u2019t be so disbarred. And what we\u2019ll be able to do is focus that strength and highlight that strength a little bit more solidly. The other thing that we saw was that affordability is one of those things that tends to get a little bit of less focus in tougher times and so in many of the markets, we fell off of our affordability messaging a bit, in some of the markets they are coming back on that. And then the core menu balance, we were chasing a few too many limited time offers. So for these primary focal markets, this is going to take time. I mean our planning process, you know us well, we plan with the franchisees and we plan not just two or three months ahead, we plan six months, nine months and usually a year ahead of time. So it\u2019s going to take a while to see some of these things layered in. But it is about a series of multiple initiatives, it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these things will take a bit of time. But I feel confident that our markets now are focused on leveraging the right processes, incorporating the right discussion points with the franchisees and moving the business for the long term in the appropriate manner.\nOperator: Next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.\nJason West - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Just one around the overall portfolio review, as part of also looking at CapEx and organic growth rate that\u2019s been picking up a little bit the last few years, and I know you guys taking a harder look at whether that\u2019s the right growth rate for the business and the right CapEx spend for the business?\nDon Thompson:  Jason, an outcome, so the refranchising plans are being built up market by market. So as we said, we didn\u2019t start this with a particular targeted mind, but we want the markets to come back to us based on their knowledge of franchisees, their local business environment, their growth potential et cetera and come back to us with a more aggressive refranchising plan than they have today. And certainly one of the outcomes of that will be, as we get more franchised that is less capital intensive. So, it will allow us to grow at the same pace, at this pace that we\u2019ve been growing at 2.5% to 3% new units with less capital. And so, it is definitely an outcome, it\u2019s not the primary objective of looking at the refranchising, but it is certainly an outcome, it makes us a little less capital intensive. But it also makes, it converts that a company operated earning stream into the more stable and predictable rent and royalty franchising income stream which we think is the most valuable piece of all of this.\nOperator: Next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens: Yes, thanks guys. Regarding the U.S., can you talk about how you\u2019d gauge the customer reaction so far at the Dollar Menu and More? And how you think you\u2019re positioned there versus your peers to lower end? And at the same time, could you kind of talk about that in the context of necessity there for a dramatic innovation to premium end as a big lever or is it at pressing in the near term at least as driving value and getting people in the door through your value proposition there?\nDon Thompson: Okay. I want to make sure, I kissed the last part of that again possibility, Will, but I\u2019ll give this is shot. Relative to Dollar Menu and more, again stepping back relative to value menu in the U.S. during roughly the last 10, 12 year history, the U.S. has evolved the Dollar Menu to ensure the menu offers our liable customer preferences several times. Those changes have been made over this 10 year period to make sure we stay relevant. But we\u2019re also mindful of the profitability aspects and the execution aspects of these menus within the restaurant. And we want to make sure that we provide the right things for our customers and we can do that over a sustained period of time. So, when we look at Dollar Menu and More, it is another of those evolutions. Dollar Menu and More as a percent of total day sales seems to be relatively in line with our historical averages. And we\u2019re not seeing any dramatic change to the usage of Dollar Menu and More. And so right at this point in time Dollar Menu and More has performed to the expectations that we have had. I think the last part Will that you have mentioned was relative to, with the relative to premium products and the role that premium products played, I would say is there is a balance between what we just talked about with affordability Dollar Menu and More our core menu offerings and our premium base products. So when you see Clubhouse Burger in one of the local window -- one of the national windows you will probably see coming up in a local window, it maybe some mentions of breakfast, maybe some mentions of affordability or mentions of a limited time offer product. So Clubhouse Burger work grade nationally which you will also have to marry that along with some of the value messaging, you will also hear some beverage messaging and breakfast messaging. So that marketing calendar has to accommodate all of those, there is definitely a place for new food and innovation, new beverages and innovation, we just want to be mindful of the core offerings we have giving them the appropriate leverage in the marketing calendar as well as dayparts like breakfast.\nOperator: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Buckingham Research.\nMatt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research: Thank you. My question is with respect to the price and I wanted to know how that might look with obviously a lot of states having some minimum wage and California going up to increasing their minimum wage over a couple of years here. In your planning process, is that 3% price that you mentioned domestically being held, is that what we will see carried out and already assumes to absorb some of that minimum wage or is there an ongoing dialogue with franchisees as far as what type of minimum wage response they might have?\nPete Bensen: Yeah, Matt. You know there are actually 13 states at the beginning of the year that raised their minimum wage anywhere from $0.10 to a $1. And that\u2019s before any potential federal minimum wage impact. So as I mentioned in my remarks we look at the traditional indices that tend to guide our pricing decision. So food away from home projected to be up 2.5 to 3.5 this year. I think inherent in that is you do see franchisees generally around the industry not just McDonald\u2019s anticipating some of these higher input costs. So they have got what the states have already enacted today. They have got the discussion about a potential at the federal level for a lot of them, the healthcare mandate kicks-in in 2015 so they have to be mindful of that. So these cost pressures are definitely on everyone\u2019s mind as you think pricing, yet as Don mentioned you have to strike that right balance between everyday affordability and providing them premium products that will drive them into the restaurant as well. But as we get too focused on individual profitability and less focused on the customer that\u2019s when we start to run into some of these challenges.\nOperator:  Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein - Barclays:  Great, thank you very much. Just focused on the U.S. business and the competitive environment perhaps obviously ex the weather and I think you have talked about kind of the QSR promotional activity kind of ramping up, I know you mentioned the free coffee promotion; you guys are doing more locally perhaps we have seen kind of buy one get one Big Mac type products. So I am just wondering whether you could talk first and foremost just about the competitive environment specially with you guys having perhaps lowest share to some of your competitors over the past couple of quarters. And as it relates to that, the breakfast which it seems like so far so good that it\u2019s fairly steady at I believe you said roughly 25% of sale I am just wondering if you can give us some insight that we don\u2019t perhaps have on the broader category and maybe how the category is growing relative to how your 25% has grown or contracted over the past year or so? Thanks.\nDon Thompson: Thanks Jeff. I will try to answer; I think you got about four or five different questions in there, buddy. But the first one relative to the U.S., U.S. comparable sales trend stabilized during the first quarter of \u201814 and we saw sequential improvement in our reported results comp results, as well as narrowing of the gap to the QSR sandwich competitive set. And excluding the impact of this year\u2019s severe winter weather, our U.S. comparable sales for the first quarter would have been relatively flat. We had about 1.4%, a little over 1.4% impact due to weather, which we don\u2019t often talk about weather because you know next year one it\u2019s much better, we probably won\u2019t talk about it either, but truth of the matter is it did have some level of impact to us, but for you I will put that in the appropriate perspective. We don\u2019t plan around weather at McDonald\u2019s, we plan around customers. A couple of other things; we continue to see some, the IEO industry in the U.S. is still relatively flat. So, we know that there is going to be a market share battle, so we\u2019ve got to focus on those things that our customers are focused on and desire. So in the U.S. there is a focus around breakfast and coffee as I mentioned, there is focused on balancing our core menu along with some of the limited time offers like you just saw with the Clubhouse Burger and Chicken Sandwich. And we\u2019ve got this basic focus on operations to ensure that we can satisfy the needs of customers particularly during the peak hours. So that gives you a pretty overall perspective I\u2019d say of our U.S. business and the state of that. From a breakfast perspective, I mentioned it a little bit earlier, our breakfast is strong and it continues to be a solid performer relative to our overall day part segments. And what we want to make sure is that we just continue to focus on the strengths that we have. And actually we have not talked as much about the quality aspects of our breakfast, we haven\u2019t talked as much about the fact that we have restaurant business that cooks. There are entrants into the marketplace that don\u2019t have the same capabilities we have. And so we're going to leverage the strengths that we have and leverage the capabilities we have to inform customers of the fact why we\u2019ve been in the breakfast business for over 30 years and why we have become America\u2019s favorite place to eat breakfast and we don\u2019t plan on giving that up.\nOperator: Next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you very much. I just want to follow-up on the U.S. business and in particular in the context of some of the commentary about maybe focusing on profitability, maybe the expenses resonating with customers. So, can you just talk a little bit about the margin structure there? First, is it still the case that you need a 3% comp to lever expenses, should it be higher because it sounds like you are looking more for traffic driven comp? And then I guess what\u2019s the right margin, company-operated over the long-term, if I look back 20, 25 years it\u2019s averaged something close to 18% in U.S. and Europe. Do you see anything that suggest it should go up or down from here or structurally just that is going to change with your margins? Thanks.\nDon Thompson:  Hi Sara. I just want to make a quick comment and then I\u2019ll turn this over to Pete on margins. First of all, we have a fantastic group of franchisees in the U.S. business. Matter of fact, next week we have our worldwide [convention] where our franchisees from around the world will be there and we're looking forward to the dialogue and discussions we\u2019ll have. So when we talk about profitability, what we're talking about is very viable businessman and businesswomen who look at the overall environment and are looking at some of the implications of commodities along with legislative pressures and then they will make decisions relative to their businesses. So, if we talk about a focus, losing a bit of the focus on the customer, it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t have solid business people or we have people that are trying to squeeze the business, they are looking at the overall perspectives of profitability, which they should do. What we've got to make sure is that our focus relative to profitability starts and ends with a customer focus and those visits to the restaurant and that's why we talk about the balanced plans. So I just wanted to reiterate that fact, I don't think we could have better franchisees, but just like us within the company, we've got to make sure that we all stay focused on the customers.\nPete Bensen: And in terms of the company-operated margins, Sara, we've historically said in a normal environment and we've defined that as being kind of a 2% to 3% inflationary environment. In that kind of normal environment, we need a 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins. And our assumption in that is that half of that comp is coming from check and half of that is coming from traffic. And so, what you saw this quarter is we've got a disproportionate share, the comp was negative, while we had over 3% price increase. So, we had a disproportionate impact of the price increase this quarter is why you saw margins down only 10 basis points. So, we, as Don mentioned in those four priority markets getting the sales and guest count trend lines stabilize and going back positive is what's going to have the most significant impact on our margins. We've always stayed at the top-line gain and we really need that comparable sales growth and the traffic growth to be able to benefit and leverage that profitability. So that's our focus and really there has been no structural change that would cause us to believe that overtime we can't continue to grow those margins as long as we're generating those positive comps.\nOperator: Your next question is from Karen Holthouse from Credit Suisse.\nKaren Holthouse - Credit Suisse: Hi. What are the -- in your prepared comments you mentioned there is going to be some increased investments on the digital side in G&A and how does that maybe relate to some of the things we\u2019ve seen in the past about testing for mobile app or what sort of form some of that medium or longer term digital initiatives might add, what sort of form they might take?\nDon Thompson: Thanks for the question, Karen. Relative to our overall digital strategy, this is something that we have been looking in many of our markets around the world for some time. However, it\u2019s not been what I would say a systemic strategy where we\u2019ve leveraged the overall strength of McDonald\u2019s. So, our digital vision is to bring in entirely new level of convenience and fun to the McDonald\u2019s experience. And what we have done to be able to move that forward is identify a couple of areas about opportunity relative to that digital strategy one is the field -- really around experience and the fact that technology can enable us to enhance the customer interactions with our brand and many people would know of that by payment, ordering, redemption type opportunities, as well as customer relationship management. The second area is an area of engagement; it\u2019s really how we engage customers both with us telling the story of some of the things we mentioned, the quality, messages around McDonald\u2019s, the opportunities within the McDonald\u2019s system, as well as our marketing campaigns and engaging social media to a stronger level. So, we are going to continue to do that. And from a global strategy perspective it\u2019s really a framework that then allows the local markets to be able to move forward more effectively, will also leverage the strength of McDonald\u2019s system globally relative to our strategic partners as we move forward. So, we\u2019ve got several markets that are test markets around the world and we are leveraging from the things that they\u2019ve already done. And we are really looking to be able to scale the best ideas we have while those things are then combined with some of the global strategies and strategic partners that we have that are much larger in terms of their scope to help us along on our digital journey.\nOperator:  Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe - JP Morgan:  Great. Hi, thank you. I think at this point just wanted to tie a couple of things up. Don, I don\u2019t think anyone either within McDonald\u2019s or outside of McDonald\u2019s would have said that you are an organization that was not run without consumer insights over the last two years. In other words, you have always been a consumer insight driven company. So I just wanted to get a sense from your perspective what really will change quantitative, qualitative, what have you over the next couple of years? And maybe with that you mentioned, you have answered to a question in terms of how you plan with franchisees over a 6 or 12 month period in terms of products and promotions what have you. So not necessarily in terms of the cost of G&A but maybe how that G&A is being spent, is there a possibility of changing the way that decisions are made in the speed of which various decision are implemented at a market? In other words, do you need to change kind of your entire decision making process and how things get implemented at the store level as we are clearly in the market that\u2019s moving much faster than it was over the past decade or so?\nDon Thompson:  Thanks for the question, John. We will always remain focused on being locally relevant. And that\u2019s the reason we have as you know John some of the market teams out there in the field, and they do a great job. And that is also to help us move quicker. So when it comes to many things at a local level, that\u2019s the way we will continue to operate by leveraging those local teams and the local insights on consumers. You asked a question about whether or not things have changed relative to consumer insights and data, we have always had data, we\u2019ve always attempted to leverage those insights, as we put forward the plans. The only thing that\u2019s different, and we\u2019ve been through this in cycles is that when you have external pressures, a number of them, sometimes our focus can shift a little bit more to how we ultimately will drive profitability at a restaurant level to handle some of those cost structures, and we lose a little bit of the front-end of those insights. And as a result, we focus more on the margin side of the business than we do on the guest count side of the business. And we know guest counts correlate to our overall results of profitability. So all we\u2019re saying that\u2019s happening in the markets, now is a refocusing on that front-end of the insights and a refocusing on how those insights need to translate to plans that are customer focused. First, we always will have the profitability aspects in mind as we plan but it\u2019s got to be customer focused first. And all of the markets and our franchisees are well aware of this, but it can happen in cycles and when it does, we just have to make sure we call that out and we go back to the drawing board around how we move this business based on customers.\nOperator: And our last question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAlex Chan - Jefferies: Hey guys, it\u2019s Alex on for Andy. I want to go back to the European business and ask you a little bit more about Russia and whether or not you saw any impact from the political unrest in the region and how that business is trending and if anything is kind of changed there in terms of the strategy with respect to value and premium products.\nDon Thompson: Thanks Alex, Pete and I will kind of double team this one a little bit. First part relative to Russia, one of the things at McDonald's, and we\u2019ve done this in all of the markets around the world. First and foremost will always be the safety of our employees and our guests. That is of the highest level importance to us. There has been no major incidents related to their safety in these current markets whether it\u2019d be Russia or the Ukraine or Crimea or anything has happened in the current situation. Our restaurants generally are operating as normal, some are temporarily adjusting that evening hours based on customer traffic and we have three restaurants in Crimea that have been closed due to suspension of necessary financial and banking services. And so that kind of gives you a state off relative to Russia. There are some financial impacts and currency impacts and I ask Pete to speak to those.\nPete Bensen:  Yes, Alex. During the quarter, the ruble was down about 14% and it was down a little bit more subsequent to the quarter end. And why that\u2019s relevant is Russia imports almost 50% of their food that they use in the restaurants and those imports are denominated, both in euro and U.S. dollar. So when the local currency devalues like that, they have a financial impact. So locally, they had a 200 basis point impact to their margins in Russia from the devaluation that translated into about a 55 basis point impact on total Europe company operated margin solely from the devaluation. So if you assume the ruble is going to stay at this depressed level the rest of the year, that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be battling with for the rest of the year in our European margins. That said, Russia has some of the most profitable restaurants around the system, so they are about 10% of our consolidated margins but they are less than 5% of our overall operating income. So in the grand scheme of things to the overall profitability, they are less than 5% but they do impact the margin line somewhat disproportionately because of those imports and because of the high volumes and the high margin they do run.\nOperator: Okay. That\u2019s all for Q&A. And I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don for a few final closing thoughts.\nDon Thompson: Thanks everyone again. And as we wrap up this morning\u2019s call, I just want to make a couple of comments about where we are positioned as McDonald\u2019s and where I see us? We remain committed to our strategies as we make thoughtful decisions to mitigate some of the short-term pressures and grow this business over the long-term. This has been consistent in terms of our approach, I have even more energy and passion around it today than I did 23 years ago, when I joined the company, because I know that this is a solid leadership team and we\u2019re well aware of what it is we need to accomplish. I\u2019m confident about our future; we have defensible competitive advantages, some of those we\u2019ve talked about; our resilient model, and the alignment across our owner operators, our suppliers and our company teams to drive enduring profitable growth for our shareholders and our system. So, I thank all of you for your participation and for your thoughts about McDonald\u2019s and we hope that you have a great day. Thanks again."}], "2016": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2015, "date": "2016-01-25 17:48:07", "content": "Executives: Chris Stent - Vice President of Investor Relations Steve Easterbrook - President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ozan - Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Andrew Charles - Cowen & Company Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Karen Short - Deutsche Bank David Tarantino - Robert W Baird David Palmer - RBC Greg Badishkanian - Citibank John Glass - Morgan Stanley Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Jason West - Credit Suisse\nOperator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald\u2019s January 25, 2016 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations from McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago. Today, we are more aligned to the system, franchisee cash flows and our major markets are improving and we have a strong commitment to executing our turnaround plan. Our near term priorities are clear. Our turnaround plan is the first step to fortifying the fundamentals of our business and restarting growth. It\u2019s grounded in running great restaurants, driving operating growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value. These actions ultimately position us to strengthen and grow as a more competitive and more modern business. We\u2019ll build on this foundation as we position McDonald\u2019s for long term growth that would drive shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. Different markets are in different stages of the turnaround. The U.S; our largest market is currently in the trajectory change phase. While we are pleased with the recent positive momentum in the U.S. it will take at least six more months of posted comparable sales and guest count growth to progress through the sustained and prolonged growth phases of our turnaround. I am confident in the actions we are taking and attraction is beginning to take hold. Most importantly, customers are noticing a difference. Our customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. In many ways 2015 was a year of two halves. The first half of the year our performance fell short of expectations as I stepped into my role, my priority was to objectively assess our business, diagnose our opportunities and develop a leaner organizational structure. The second half of the year was about execution. The new operating structure that went into effect on July 1 sharpened our focus through a great accountability and removed distractions and bureaucracy to speed up decisions and increase our ability to move winning tactics quickly across markets. As markets adjusted to how they think and operate we began to get traction, ending the year on an upwards trajectory. Comparable sales were up 5% for the full quarter, up 1.5% for the full year. Operating income was up 16% for the quarter and earnings per share increased 26% both in constant currencies. Various current employer items outside our normal operations impacted earnings comparisons. Kevin will share more details. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been up 10% for the quarter in constant currencies. Now let\u2019s turn to segment performance. The U.S. remains fundamental to our turnaround given a significant contribution to consolidated results. U.S. comparable sales increased 5.7% for the full quarter marking the best quarter in nearly four years. For the full year, comparable sales grew 50 basis points, an encouraging change in trends after two years of declines. While we\u2019ve seen recent improvements in comparable guest counts they remain negative for the full year. We need to do even more to increase the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we\u2019ve lost. Strong partnership with franchisees as we execute our business building initiatives has resulted in growth in restaurant level cash flows for both the quarter and the year. This is just one more indication of the progress we are making. Our formula for success in the U.S. consistent with many other markets, a focus on operational excellence coupled with relevant menu news, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees. The foundational steps we took to enhance menu quality simplify restaurant operations and offer even more convenience to customers led to a palpable shift in momentum in the third quarter. All Day Breakfast fills on this momentum in the fourth quarter exceeding internal expectations during the launch phase. It\u2019s driving incremental business. Many customers who otherwise would have gone elsewhere are coming to McDonald's to enjoy some of their favorite breakfast items like our Egg McMuffin and Hash Browns at lunch and throughout the rest of the day. At the same time, existing customers are adding breakfast entrees to their regular orders, boosting sales and average check. In addition to benefitting top and bottom line growth, all-day breakfast positions us to regain market share we\u2019ve given up in recent years. Infact, since the launch of all-day breakfast we\u2019ve experienced positive weekly comparable sales gaps relative to our QSR sandwich competitors and we ended the quarter with a positive gap for 2.9%. Another priority in the U.S. is the establishment of a consistent national value offering. We began testing McPick 2 earlier this month. This value offer gives customers the flexibility to bundle their choice of two items at a compelling price points. Whilst it\u2019s still early, the offer appears to be resonating with customers. We\u2019ll continue to list them, and apply what we are learning as we move towards a more permanent national platform later this year to compliment the ongoing regional efforts. I\u2019d also be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that the U.S. and several other large markets also benefitted from mild weather in the quarter. Let\u2019s now turn to the international lead segment, which continues to operate from a position of strength. Full quarter comparable sales increased 4.2% and comparable sales were up 3.4% for the year. Strong full quarter comparable sales marked the U.K.\u2019s 39th consecutive quarter of growth as the market outperformed both the competition and the wider retail sector. Performance was driven by a number of customer oriented office. Successful promotions featuring premium products like the new Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legends drove growth and average check. The strong focus on our core menu items continued to elevate customer perceptions around quality and steady progress towards our experience of the future continues. About a quarter of the U.K\u2019s restaurants are being converted, and plans are in place to do more throughout 2016. These restaurants offer modern in-store service platforms, such as self-order kiosks, digital merchandising and customized order pick up ways. We recently tested table service, and based on customers\u2019 favorable reaction; we plan to roll out across nearly all converted restaurants in 2016. Australia also delivered a strong quarter of comparable sales despite lapping its best quarter in 2014. The market-wide deployment of experience of the future is driving incremental business. Customers were enjoying conveniences such as self-order kiosks and table service and taking advantage of the opportunity to customize their entrees to satisfy individual tastes. Australia continues to fuel future growth by capitalizing on wins in other markets. Most recently it\u2019s taken a chapter out of the U.S. playbook testing all-day breakfast in 300 restaurants; it plans to go national later this quarter. Australia\u2019s ability to quickly scale the successful initiative from the U.S. highlights one of the many ways our new segment operating structure is creating a more nimble McDonald's. In Canada, balanced growth across all-day parts drove another quarter with strong comparable sales. Engaging marketing campaigns including monopoly, festive food events, and the successful free copy promotion resonated strongly with customers. At the same time, the market continues to make progress towards its version of experiencing the future. More than 175 restaurants are being converted with a significant number of additional conversions flattened in 2016. In Germany and France, full quarter comparable sales were relatively flat. Germany\u2019s successful monopoly promotion featuring premium products along with our focus on add-on items help drive average check in a highly competitive environment. Value remains a critical priority in Germany. In the coming weeks, we launch an integrated value strategy across our menu to strengthen our appeal to value conscious consumers. In France, the macro environment remains challenging. The informally eating out market recorded its fifth consecutive year of decline. On top of the lagging economy and dampened consumer purchasing power, the November terrorist attack negatively impacted the entire eating out industry. We have seen this in Paris and in other cities throughout Europe. Despite these headwinds, our brand remains strong in France. Successful monopoly promotions, along with the introduction of new premium products are increasing average check. At the same time we are giving customers more options across lower tiers of our menu. The new items added to our Petit Plaisir line and the extension of McFirst into other proteins including fish. We are working to become even more accessible to customers as we continue to open new restaurants including five new airport sites that were part of a deal we recently closed with Aeroport de Paris. Turning to the high growth segment, full quarter comparable sales increased 3% and the comparable sales grew up 1.8% for the year. China\u2019s full quarter comparable sales increased 4%. Successful execution of key initiatives around value, convenience and breakfast are driving market share increases in a flat IEO environment. Despite recent external challenges, we remain confident in the potential of this important market, and in the strategies we have in place to expand the brand even further. Infact, we plan to open more than 250 restaurants in China in 2016, the highest of any of our markets. In Russia, strong comparable sales in the fourth quarter reflected ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, results may volatile moving forward giving continuing macro economic uncertainties and decreased consumer purchasing power. One additional market I\u2019d like to highlight is Japan, where comparable sales increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Results were partly driven by comparisons to last year\u2019s supplier issue, even so this marked Japan\u2019s best quarterly performance in nearly four years. Same is diligently executing its revitalizing plan as they work to strengthen the brands appeal to customers. Our consolidated performance reflects the meaningful progress we have made to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. Although some of our larger markets face challenging headwinds as we enter 2016, we expect continued positive topline momentum across all segments. We are focused on what we can control and committed to elevating every aspect what the customer experience. This is about running great restaurants and our entire system is rallying around this essential imperative every day. The steps we\u2019ve taken have driven notable improvements in many larger markets but there\u2019s more work to done. 2016 will be about continuing to execute our turnaround plans, we\u2019ll concentrate on fortifying the fundamentals of our business as we deliver what people want and expect from McDonald's today while establishing the foundation for future growth. Thanks everyone. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Steve and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business and charting our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas. Today, I\u2019d like to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results, review our outlook for 2016, and provide an update on the progress we\u2019ve made on financial decisions announced in November. Let\u2019s start with the look at fourth quarter results. As Steve indicated, we delivered solid comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter. The increase in fourth quarter operating income reflects the benefit of positive comparable sales across all segments, a testament to the early impact of our turnaround efforts. Fourth quarter results also reflected various current and prior year items outside of our normal operations. Relative to the prior year, these items included comparison against results which were negatively impacted by the China supplier issue and an increase in our tax reserves. In the current year, these items included a gain of $135 million from the sale of a U.S. restaurant property and asset impairment charges of about $70 million in conjunction with our global refranchising efforts. Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.13 or 10% in constant currencies. Topline performance continues to have the biggest impact on our margins, and its one of the best indicators of the strength of our underlying business. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 50 basis points to 82%, driven primarily by the solid comparable sales in the U.S. and international lead markets. Global company operated margin dollars increased 8% in constant currencies just $612 million for the quarter. While the company operated margin percent increased to 80 basis points to 15.2%. Comparison against challenging prior year results in the high growth and foundational segments accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter. Partly offsetting these margin gains were higher incremental labor costs in the U.S. reflecting the ongoing impact from our decision earlier in the year to increase crew wages and benefits. These costs along with minimum wage increase have mandated by several states during the year, negatively impacted fourth quarter U.S. margins by about 350 basis points consistent with our expectations. Solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity cost helped minimize the impact of this labor pressure. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs decreased about 1% primarily due to lower beef cost. Looking ahead, U.S. Company operated margins for the first half of 2016 will continue to be impacted by labor pressures of a similar magnitude in both first and second quarters. To offset some of this inflationary pressure, our U.S. fourth quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2% placing our full year pricing below food away from home inflation of around 2.5%. 2016 food away from home inflation is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. Commodity costs for the international lead markets segment were up about 1% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 3%. Looking ahead to full year 2016, commodity costs for the international lead segment are expected to be relatively flat, while U.S. commodities are expected to decline 1% to 2%. G&A for the fourth quarter totaled $675 million, up 7% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation versus the prior year. Excluding incentive based compensation, G&A for the quarter decreased to as expected. For the full year of 2016, G&A is expected to decrease about 1% to 2% in constant currencies. We expect G&A increases in the second and third quarters due to our worldwide convention in April and the summer Olympics in August. Foreign currencies negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.11 and the full year by $0.50. At current exchange rates, there will be less pressure in 2016 with an expected negative impact on first quarter of $0.04 to $0.06 and full year of $0.18 to $0.20. As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Now I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2015 and our financial decisions announced in November around G&A, refranchising and our capital structure. Starting with our G&A spend. In November, we disclose our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize $150 million in savings by the end of 2016 with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. We anticipate completing the vast majority of the remaining $350 million in savings by the end of 2017. Developing our ownership strategy is also a fundamental component of our turnaround efforts and the catalyst for our decision to refranchise about 4000 restaurants by the end of 2018. While our refranchising targets implies approximately 1000 restaurants per year, we expect variability around this average within a given year as we work to balance the necessary time needed to select the best franchisees with our desire to execute our refranchising plans in an expedient manner. During 2015 we refranchised about 470 restaurants and we are currently making progress towards completing the sale of two international markets to developmental licensees that will include the refranchising of over 400 restaurants. As part of our evaluation of ownership strategies around the world, we have been reviewing our ownership levels in all markets. In conjunction with this effort, we are exploring the sale of a portion of our ownership in McDonald's Japan if we identify a strategic investor who could help advance Japan\u2019s turnaround efforts and unlock our growth potential with a view of enhancing value for all stakeholders. We are in the early stages of the process and taking a thoughtful approach. We have an experienced and talented management team and a strong group of franchisees, all of whom are committed to enhancing our brand and supporting our turnaround in Japan with the Japanese consumer in mind. Right now, we\u2019re focus on exploring the viability of finding the appropriate strategic investor. We are confident that whatever may transpire with our ownership McDonald\u2019s Corporation and McDonald\u2019s Japan will continue to have a franchise or franchisee relationship intended to promote McDonald\u2019s brand and business in Japan. We remain confident in the McDonald\u2019s Japan business for the long term and their commitment to revitalizing the brand in Japan. In connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets. During 2016 we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring. In November we also committed to optimizing our capital structure. One month later we added $6 billion of debt to our balance with an average tenure of over 15 years and an average coupon of 3.8%. We will likely have further debt additions during 2016 as we expect to return a total of about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. For the three years ended 2015 we return $15.8 billion to shareholders leaving about $14 billion in combined dividends and share repurchase to be completed in 2016. Collectively our refranchising efforts, G&A management and capital structure optimization will contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders. In addition to moving forward on the financial decisions, we\u2019re maintaining our balanced and measured approach of investing in our business to drive future growth. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion split fairly evenly between opening about a 1,000 new restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants. The majority of our new store capital is earmarked for the international lead and high growth markets, while roughly half of our investment capital will be devoted to U.S. restaurants. As we begin the New Year, we\u2019re encouraged by recent results. However our financial performance in the coming year is not likely to be linear. As we move through 2016 we expect some variability in our quarterly results due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in some of our high growth market and challenging quest counts in the U.S., Germany and France. Generating sustained positive guest traffic in these markets and around the world remains the top priority for 2016. We also anticipate limited pricing power in several of our markets, as a relatively benign commodity outlook and low inflation could impact our ability to increase menu board prices. In closing, we begin 2016 in a stronger position. Positive top and bottom line momentum across all segments and greater alignment with franchisees around our near-term path forward. We are committed to executing our turnaround plan, which starts with the diligent execution of operating great restaurants on a daily basis. At the same time, we remained confident in our ability to execute against our financial decisions and evolve to a leaner, more heavily franchise business that generates long term value for our shareholders. Thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris, to begin our Q&A\nA - Chris Stent: Thanks, Kevin. We will now the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To get as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Andrew Charles at Cowen & Company.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. Mike, or if you're on the line, Steve as well, could you talk about the decision to run the January and February value platform at $2, as it seemed most quick-service sandwich operators are running promos in the $4 to $6 range prior to the introduction? As well as the margin profile of what McPick 2 look to looks like as well?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. There is no Mike here at the moment, so Steve here. So, I\u2019ll try on for this one for you, Andrew. Yes. So, we launched on 4th of January, we know that around 25% of our customers are value conscious, and that\u2019s value at a number of price points, but certainly at the entry level. And we like the construct of McPick 2. It\u2019s very early days. There is no like regular trading, information that we can particular share right now, but we know that the choice and the flexibility that we offer with two items at that compelling price point is attractive. As you say others have chosen a different price point to go in and bundled more items into it. We think the choosing two out of four items we have in that menu gives that, that right balance between its simple, its easy for the customer that gives them the choice and flexibility and through the quarter of handful weeks we\u2019re certainly read the consumer response to it, we analyze the business results of it and can continue to work on developing the right value platform for us on an ongoing basis.  The lead item on it is the double cheeseburger. That sold well but also the mozzarella sticks are going down really, really well and it\u2019s a great add-on item. So it\u2019s an incremental profit driver if you like both within the McPick 2 but also it\u2019s not an ultimately same.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you very much. You think about the outperformance that you saw against the industry in the fourth quarter of almost 300 basis points. Do you see this trend is a path in the fourth quarter maybe driven by the euphoria of all expected to settle in it a more moderate outperformance trend? Or do you think -- see this as something in collaboration with all your initiatives that something that\u2019s somewhat sustainable against you peers?\nSteve Easterbrook: Well, certainly the idea of outperforming is something we want to maintain. We entered the quarter with good momentum in our business, clearly that was accelerated through the fourth quarter. And as we\u2019ve said, all-day breakfast was a primarily driver of that, but not the sole driver, so it exceeded our launch expectations, the period of time for it had exceeded our launch expectation, it was also little longer that we had projected, but we do expected to settle down. But and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on a number of other initiatives in the business to follow that up, so this is not \u2013 we don\u2019t want this to be a single initiative turnaround plan, so the continued investment in food quality that could be the development of this value platform. And as we continue to reinvest in the fabric of our restaurant, we\u2019re confident the in-store experience will continue to improve.  The operation improvements we\u2019re seeing to the drive-through old records in particular, we see its paying dividends, early days after launching a number of initiatives around people that beginning to see our start turnover decrease quite notable as well which we believe helps us deliver a better days experience. So, there\u2019s a number of dimensions to it, all-day breakfast is understandable a more of the headline grab up, it will settle down a little from its launch space, but we believe the building is other platforms of growth on top of that will keep us competitive in the marketplace in taking share.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.\nKaren Short: Hi. Just following on that question, I was just curious in terms of the layers of momentum, you didn\u2019t even really given an update on the app. And then I also wondering if you could give a little update on the U.S. like guest experience in the future I think you were at 130 units in November? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Hi, Karen. Its still early days for us, but I mean for us its \u2013 what we can offer in the future is exciting. What we\u2019re actually delivering now is really just a start, so we only really launch the app here in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter last year. But within three months we had over 7 million downloads which I think just start signal, the magnitude that we can build to as we develop office and functionality way beyond the basic. At the moment its largely offer base we\u2019re seeing those downloads being activated by customers and redeeming the offers in the restaurants. So, we believe its driving behavior. We\u2019re able to follow consumer behavior easy so we can read the data from it. But certainly as we build the capability of the app we think it\u2019s going to increase the compelling and the growth engine. I would say that. For the first time, here at McDonald\u2019s we have build in a trading increase, a sale, an incremental sale expectations based on our digital platform. So little modest in 2016, but we\u2019re actually contributing to the business growth and being a platform this is going to deliver for many years to come as we can kind of understand our consumer behavior and be more rewarding to them. With regards to the second piece, experience the future. We have around five markets up and running, as you say, with about a 130 restaurants. We\u2019re certainly looking to expand not necessarily those markets, but into new markets at a larger scale. And the U.S. will again pick some lead regions. So this is where the regional strength of the U.S. really comes to the fall. We got 23 regions here in the U.S. we\u2019ll be picking two or three of those to really look to accelerate that version here in the U.S. they experience the future through 2016 and into 2017. But there would be adopting a slightly different approach in those three regions, so it can actually learn in the market here what truly resonates the customers, what the business results are and the future potential. So, and also given on this structure now we\u2019re learning so rapidly from the way that Australian has build their business kind of the building there as U.K. France and particular theirs, but we are rich in inside which is helping each other makes smarter decisions and shorten the time line, so we\u2019re certainly share more in a moment, the moment the majority of our growth we\u2019re building into the U.S. performance through 2016 is through continuing to deliver against the basics of our turnaround plan.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question is on the U.S. comps momentum you saw in the fourth quarter which was very impressive, I was wondering Steve, if you help to sort of dissect what some of the drivers were in particular if you could help to quantify what you think to live from all-day breakfast might have been during the quarter and also the weather impact and then that\u2019s question number and then as a follow-up perhaps if you could talk about some of the structural improvements you\u2019re seeing what driver-through simplification if you\u2019re starting to see some progress and to be a service there? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Thanks, David. We don\u2019t want to give specifics on the respect drivers. But the pace that I want to make sure we don\u2019t lose it, but we were building momentum heading into the quarter and heading into the launch of all-day breakfast and I won\u2019t necessarily do a full laundry list of the work that team have done, but certainly around the fundamentals delivering a better high quality food experience day and day out. And you know, you heard me talk about the Devils is in the detail always around toasting of the buns and searing of the beef, and when you ally that with investing in the types of quality investment that customers care about structures; one of the antibiotics move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcement that we on our journey is going to cage-free eggs. That just creates a buzz and customers know that you care about the same things that they care about and they just respond with their business. All-day breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be -- we focus the restaurants both operationally, marketing and merchandizing on that. As I say through the launch base, we help contribute materially for the quarter, absolutely no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the self contribution that we had projected and as I say it lasted longer through than a typical launch period does. But inevitably a settle down as we introduce other initiatives in the restaurants through 2016. the weather was no simple but not material, but I just though it was approximately and transparent to reference it because it did give us a positive contribution not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world that did provide a helpful tailwinds but I thought it would fair to recognize and just acknowledge. In terms of the drive-though in particular, certainly the streamlines menu boards have made life easier for our customers and made life easier for managers and crew in the restaurants .So that experience has simplified and help speed things up. Alongside, the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-through we\u2019ve identified this order accuracy, so the team the operational teams have been working really on initiative \u2013 again, I won\u2019t go into the details we could ask \u2013 it just the way that we, the order experience to the customer where we can just confirm twice over that we capture the order right and then we\u2019re presenting exactly the right order to the customers before they drive off. And we\u2019re finding that as noticeably improved well accuracy which in turns improve speed and clearly customer satisfaction, so we got plenty more to do. We\u2019re working through and continue to challenge the menu and if there is further simplification areas there, but simplification goes way beyond that. There\u2019s has been through packaging, through merchandizing through marketing where we can help the restaurants teams by taking work load of them, taking focus on the fundamentals of what they want for serving customers.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. In the last turnaround, but one of the early 2000s, clearly there\u2019s a focus or refocus on service execution you\u2019re just touching on some of that, so if you have any numbers on customer satisfaction today or in future quarters I think that will be really helpful to for people to get their head around the sustainability of return that maybe starting with all-day breakfast trial and bringing back those lapsed users. On the premium platform innovation front, you feel like you\u2019re using this window perhaps being created by all-day breakfast to give yourself a pace of testing that is greater and in fact that you\u2019re building that pipeline for 2017 and beyond and if so, how is that looking and what giving your confidence there? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Hi, David. So, in terms of customer satisfaction obviously we got a number of different ways that we can monitor customer\u2019s satisfaction, and we have one or two different systems around the world. There is not pay consistent measure as we speak. But we move and transition to a new customer satisfaction measure here which we call the Voice, which is actually we\u2019re gather multiple number of a customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously, so I didn\u2019t explain that very well. We\u2019re gathering a lot more consumer feedback than we ever have done, is the better way of saying is, certainly we\u2019re seeing overall satisfaction improving both in drive through and install and we\u2019re certainly seeing order accuracy in the drive through.  We\u2019re around \u2013 the actually satisfaction on speed in improving, our speed time haven\u2019t improved as much as satisfaction has done, so we want to work operationally to physically speed up as service experience, but the same time customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed, which is very encouraging. So that means the overall experience is working for them. In terms of the premiums, yes, absolutely, as you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers that you can layer upon each other, it means you can raised ahead and look a little further in the way you plan and develop the business. So, on the premium side and by the way each market doesn\u2019t have to work in isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the whether its Create Your Taste in Australia, a new premium range of signature burgers in the U.K. a similar version of that within France for example, and we have these sophisticated, well executed rollout across those market all of which is helping is inform us that where we had with the experience in the further. What we do now is customization is important. We don\u2019t know quite how much customization customers truly wish, it like a little bit of flexibility, but I don\u2019t need to have complicated, so we\u2019re working on that for example,  We\u2019re working on the manner in which customers can order those premium burgers, a way from the traditional just through the drive-through or at the front counter and that\u2019s where I self order kiosks and potentially you can say where service comes into play. But again, we\u2019re getting a really good read on progress in some of other mature and lead markets and that certainly helping shape and inform the thinking here in the U.S. So, more to come, are we using the time to work on developing that platform? Absolutely yes, we are.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Greg Badishkanian at Citibank. Q - Greg Badishkanian Great. Thanks. Just trying to understand where you\u2019re getting your new customers from which is lifting same-store sales. You had two big introductions, the two for $2 all-day breakfast and do you think you\u2019re gaining \u2013 are you gaining those from burgers operators or while QSR to bought a restaurant category and just define each one, so I think you might be getting customers for each of those two programs?\nSteve Easterbrook: Hi, Greg. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear, but we go through the revitalize stage of this turnaround, the market share that we\u2019re looking to recover and grow is in our more immediate competitive grow. So that kind of QSR segment. And then as we strength and then ultimately want to get back to leadership position that we\u2019re aspire to, I think that growth will come from broader eye, So, at the moment the initial momentum we\u2019re seeing typically around the world is coming from QSR, some of that is recovering share as we lost as well. So, that\u2019s certainly hardening for us. I would say, potentially one slide difference from that is around all-day breakfast which where we\u2019re capturing customers with really what is a different occasion there. So -- and that is new to us and McDonald\u2019s. I think the customers where the incremental business, an incremental visits were getting off probably from broader IEO segment, but typically our focus on this initial stage turnaround is around winner nearing market and recovering what we\u2019ve lost to getting into a period of outperformance.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Just related -- somewhat related maybe actually unrelated, but one is on the pricing, you talked about being cautious on pricing overall all over in the U.S. I think you said the food away from home inflation was going to run some two plus percent, are you saying that you feel good about pricing in the U.S. given that inflationary level and if they maybe elsewhere and maybe talk about how you think about U.S. pricing specifically. And just to clarify the SG&A, if you take it down 1% to 2% from 2015 levels its not going to match the 150 million your savings more like 50 billion, so is that because you\u2019re not including the operator conference in the Olympics on that calculation that sort of one off or not factored into that 500 million or how do we think about that?\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks, John. Let me start with the pricing, because we think about pricing relatively similarly around the world and that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing that include food inflation, GDP growth, our internal cost inflation et cetera. Similar to how the U.S. will do it. So, for 2015 we said that the U.S. increase their prices a little over 2% compared to food away from home inflation of around 2.5% and that for 2016 food away from home inflation was expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%, so we would continue to think about pricing in a similar way as we\u2019ve been and keep an eye on that food away from home inflation, as well as food at home inflation just to make sure that we\u2019re not getting out of whack with that. Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is, we saved \u2013 I\u2019ll say a little more then half of that $150 million in 2015, which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We\u2019ll look at 2016 similarly, so while we may not get all of those actual savings realized in 2016 will have it out of our base by the end of 2016, so that as we go into 2017 we\u2019re going in with the base, that\u2019s $150 million less than where we started at the 2.6 billion and that\u2019s a net number, so that includes the Olympics conventional or the additional cost in there also.\nChris Stent: Net question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thanks. Good morning. Going back to mobile you said 7 million downloads I believe, is that since you launched and how many have redeemed offers and what can you tell us about the profile. And then just a final thought on mobile, I believe if I understood correctly you early said, it\u2019s modestly in the guidance and what is giving you that convection to make that comment. Is this is new customer? Is it a loyal customer that spending more, just want are they doing? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Can you just repeat just that second part of the question, Nicole, about something in the balance?\nChris Stent: Why convictions were including.\nSteve Easterbrook: Okay. Okay. Someone\u2019s explained here. Right, it\u2019s a two point of that question. So, there are number of metrics that we will follow through and we follow closely on a weekly basis, daily and weekly basis on the app. One is clearly the downloads. Then you want the registration numbers and then you want to see the activity. So we have 7 million downloads which gives people access to things like restaurant Russian locator, nutritional information and the rest. As I start to share their information get confident with us and clearly then they will start to register and we can then communicate if they no choice of their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start to localize the offers to them and then we start to see the behavior. We are seeing higher registration rates than industry norms from those downloads and we\u2019re also then tracking effectively frequency of usage and we\u2019re trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play such as buy any five McCafes of any size and you one free. So it and you get one free. So it\u2019s a fairly basic loyalty play just to get people familiar with using it and actively using and keeping it on their phones basically.  The reason we have build a sale build into 2016 is because we have seen the incremental business, We\u2019ve have seen the incremental average check of redemptions, so when people redeem an offer we\u2019re actually seeing higher average check than we had expected to see, so we can see there\u2019s an incremental business driver, plus we got other initiatives that we both scale the number of customer and usage, but also enhance the overall experience as well which will encourage people to return to that more often and clearly hopefully return to McDonald\u2019s more often.  So we have it really -- we have it week-by-week and month-by-month as a build and we about to clearly update ourselves on whether we hitting those projections, but its \u2013 it will be a helpful contributed to sales in 2016 and will help guide us around the world beyond to actually derive that return on the investments we\u2019re making in this digital strategy as a home.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley: Thank you. Like to ask two related questions on plans, First, with respect to the U.S. turnaround and sustainability of the U.S. turnaround, can you talk about some of the pipeline of ideas or you mentioned a platforms a couple of time, if you could be able to be more specific about how you\u2019re think about product news and innovation to sustained the U.S. comp and then a little bit longer term you\u2019ve referenced in the past that you would be sharing a longer term strategy at the worldwide on a operating conference in April and probably sharing that with the street sometime thereafter, I guess I was curious if that was still the game plan and if you can put any outline or any meet around what we might here?\nSteve Easterbrook: Okay, Joe, so confidence as we build through 2016 in the U.S. I mean clearly we\u2019re planning for growth and we have a very robust plan that team has build, so that gives us confidence. We will continue to work the breakfast platform and beverage platform hard. Anyways its important day part for us and the all-day breakfast is the further growth opportunity which we\u2019re going to continue to work hard through 2016, getting the value platform right will be important to us as well we are taking a very serious look at it and learning from it before we than go into a national and permanent launch base but we feel good about where we\u2019re at in the moments. You can expect to see as also focus more on our call menu. You know we are proud of the menu and we believe there is \u2013 these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we could \u2013 we can probably do a better job with it. We can bring to life and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and create some fun around that. You can expect to see. For to create fun around the brand you will also expect to return to one or two be promotional mechanics we have. We got opportunities throughout the year to just bring it some variety and some fun around promotional activity, shorter term promotional activity just to help provide that balance for the menu. So I think -- and then with the digital platform layering on top of that, we believe we\u2019re building these building a platform that will continue to grow through 2016, but will also take this into 2017 and beyond. As we develop and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience the Future that is something we know the system is excited about, we know its creating a lot of energy momentum elsewhere on the world and getting that right, and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is going to important to us and we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re going learn in 2016 [ph] because we believe that\u2019s going to contribute to 2017 and beyond.  It sounds the longer terms strategy, I guess what we will want to see is we\u2019ve had two quarters of growth in this turnaround, so we would certainly be looking to see another quarter or two before we ourselves start to moving the turnaround plan into a longer term growth plan. What I can\u2019t tell you is that we have a small and senior team looking at developing what that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it and the vision behind it, but it\u2019s a small chain that\u2019s working discretely on it because at the moment the entire organization globally is focused on a turnaround. So, whether it\u2019s later in the second quarter or sometime in the third quarter, I would say by around the middle of the year when we get confident that it\u2019s the right time to transition from turn around it\u2019s a growth who share that internally and soon after externally.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse: Hi, thank you for taking the question. Looking at the remodel CapEx going into U.S. stores, can you give us a sense of where the majority of those dollars are going? Is it more going to sort of cleaning up longer tailed stores that maybe haven\u2019t been reinvested in recently or more specific initiatives around kiosks or digital menu boards or something like that?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, Karen. For 2016, we said that about half of the reinvestment around the world will be reinvested in the U.S. That consists of several buckets if you will. It\u2019s probably four to five hundred reimages in 2016, about 90 rebuilds where we kind of tear down the restaurant and put up a new one. It also would include capacity enhancements, things like putting in side by side drive through as well as our normal maintenance CapEx. It also would include digital menu boards in substantially all the restaurants in the U.S. So it consists of several of those components that would kind of comprise the total reinvestment in the U.S.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer: Great, thank you. As the U.S. same-store sales recovery continues to build momentum, how should we be thinking about the pace of a potential restaurant level margin recovery, just a little color on that? You guys have obviously given us some color on not only cost of goods sold for 2016, some of the incremental labor pressure that you introduced maybe by through last year, but is there anything preventing you from returning to the high teens of the U.S. restaurant level margins over the next couple of years again big caveat, I understand but assuming you guys can continue to deliver some topline momentum, can we see these high teens restaurant level margins again in the U.S.?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, thanks Jeff. You know as you know when we talk about pretty often margins for us are topline gain. I mentioned that we\u2019ll have some pressure first and second quarter in 2016 as we kind of round out the additional labor cost that we have from the decision we made to increase wages for our restaurant crew. But with benign commodity cost, relatively reasonable inflation and hopefully from pricing capability, it will come down to what kind of comps we are able to achieve to determine whether we can grow margins. I think what fourth quarter should have shown everyone is even with those labor pressures when we have good comps, you know again depending on where commodities are we are able to offset a lot of those pressures. So it really does come down to continuing to grow comps.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Just a follow-on, on that question. Just wondering how you actually think about the interplay of commodity and labor especially as you look at the offerings going forward. I mean right now obviously with the commodity down, labor up, but just wondering is pricing easier this way or would you prefer do it the reverse? I think, I think you mentioned from a food stand point where the food away from home is still 2.5% to 3.5% and you are going to be less than that. But food at home seems like its well below that entirely. So I\u2019m just wondering, how you think about those two buckets being that they are similar in size, and you know the concern you might have on even pricing at that 2% plus level. Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, it\u2019s a good point in that I don\u2019t want to oversimplify how we look at pricing. We have to look at to your point beyond just food away from home as one piece of information. Food at home exactly as you mentioned is clearly below food away from home right now. And so, we look at food inflation in total because we need to make sure that kind of home is the competitor and people could be leaving us if you will to eat more at home. But we have to look at all costs, both food and labor to determine pricing and it also comes into play of what our competitors are doing, the demographics of where we are, so there is a lot of things that go into determining pricing. I don\u2019t know if I can pick one or another as far as what I\u2019d rather have labor or food be high cost if you will.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just one point I would add to that Jeff is whilst we will clearly build an assumption into our plans because that\u2019s how we set our plans, we don\u2019t make a single pricing decision just once a year we make decisions across the year. So we can always guage the consumer, consumer confidence where our costs are going and where the competitive environment is and do our best clearly to make the right decision. So it\u2019s -- we have multiple opportunities across the year to reassess and make sure that we are certainly seizing the opportunity but without being -- taking it too far.\nChris Stent: We have time for one more question and it will be from Jason West of Credit Suisse.\nJason West: Yes, thanks guys. Just on the market share number, can you give the two components of that you know the McDonald's number and the equivalent calculation and then the industry number that you saw to get to the 29 and then see just big picture on that sort of same store sales, trajectory. You know we\u2019ve been dealing with challenging markets around the world, it feels like for several years now and you guys are starting to see momentum despite that but if feels like the volatility and the challenges only can be get worse each year, so how does that affect you guys going forward, do you think we\u2019re still kind of an environment we\u2019ve been in or have things you know externally maybe gotten a bit worse? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Like in terms of the market share takes then we would take across the pretty much the 14 week period, but our growth would be at 5.7% in the QSR sandwich segment ex-McDonald's would be 2.8 giving us the differential of 2.9. So, overall growth in the market we were outperforming that clearly. In terms of around the world, we want to be careful that we don\u2019t sound too anxious and create concern around the headwinds and what have you, because there is so much of our ability to grow is in our own hands. And you know we are really focussing on what we can control. I mean, we have noticed and we have a history of being successful in many many countries around the world through strong economic times as well as challenging economics times as long as we do the right thing about the customer. So overall, we are confident heading into this year. We\u2019ve been through the plan in detail of our largest nine or ten markets, and I\u2019m confident they will deliver the growth to a level that we are satisfied and we are challenging ourselves hard on it. I also want to be pragmatic. In France in the moment for example, it\u2019s tough, IEOs decreased for five years in a row. So if you are going to grow the business, you really have to take a significant amount of share in the declining market for that to translate into topline growth. And to do that you don\u2019t want to free yourself out of your longer term strategy and the brand building they have done. So, I think there are some realities and it is right for us just to be a little cautious about, but if I take a look at the collective across the U.S., across the lead markets and the high growth markets, you know we are building plans and certainly on a consolidated basis with an expectation of growing. So -- but as you will know from the markets even the start of this year, volatility just creates a scrappier environment and a little bit of nervousness whether its across investor community and sometimes in certain markets across customers. So we need to be mindful or sensitive to that, you know China is a good example where you know that kind of volatility in the market place just create a little bit of anxiety. So that\u2019s why we want to reinforce our confidence in that market in growing our core business as well as incremental units and new store of growth. So we're mindful. We stay close. But we remain quietly confident.\nChris Stent: We\u2019re at the top of the hour, so I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve with a few closing comments.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks, Chris. And again thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. 2015 was a year of change. We are running McDonald's differently and building on our unique advantages as we strive to become a modern and progressive burger company. Our fourth quarter results reflect the meaningful progress we\u2019ve made. And whilst there is more work to be done, we are on the right path. We are focussed on our customers and delivering what matters most to them. Hot fresh food, fast friendly service, in a contemporary environment, all are the value of McDonald's. I am confident in our ability to sustain a positive momentum as we continue to execute our turnaround plans into 2016, and I\u2019m excited about our longer term opportunities to strengthen our business and reassert McDonald's as the global leader we know we are. Thanks, and everyone have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations from McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Last month, we provided unaudited summary financial information and historical segment data consistent with the company\u2019s new structure. The updated annual information was provided for 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details were also provided for 2014 through June 2015. Specific questions related to this summary financial information and historical segment data will be addressed by the Investor Relations team through a frequently asked questions document that will be distributed on October 30. Given the very limited number of questions received, we are no longer planning to host a separate conference call to discuss this information. And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we have made meaningful progress to fuel our turnarounds and begin repositioning McDonald\u2019s as a modern progressive burger company. Our turnaround is operationally led. It\u2019s grounded in running great restaurants, which is the first step to enhancing the customer experience. People have more choices than ever about where to dine. We want to give them more reasons to dine in McDonald\u2019s by recommitting to hot fresh food, cost friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald\u2019s. Our number one priority is to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. To do so, we must be customer centric in our planning and our decision-making. We must have the best talent in the most critical positions. And our system must be aligned around the actions we are taking to consistently run great restaurants. And we must execute initiatives that ultimately enhance our appeal in the areas that matter most to consumers, to great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value. Whilst we are still in the early phases, our turnaround plan is working. Customers are beginning to respond to the actions we are taking and this progress is reflected in our third quarter results. As we have discussed previously, the U.S. and international lead market segments generate over 80% of global operating income. For third quarter, five of our six most significant markets drove positive comparable sales growth with France\u2019s comparable sales being marginally negative. We also grew consolidated margins, operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis. These results do, in part, reflect the benefits from comparisons to the 2014 China supplier issue and the prior year\u2019s increasing tax reserves. However, operating results for the quarter were still up modestly when you exclude these items and take into consideration the significant currency headwinds. Looking ahead, as we begin fourth quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments. Every market face a significant role in our global turnaround. Some markets like Canada, Australia and the UK are further along. They continue to deliver strong, sustained growth. That said, all markets have adjusted how they think and how they operate to ensure their actions and decisions are grounded in satisfying customers in their local markets today and for the long-term. The U.S. business remains front and center given its fundamental importance to overall consolidated results. Its shift to positive comparable sales in the third quarter, the first quarterly comparable sales increase in the U.S. in two years is a tangible sign of the progress and reflects the initial steps we have taken in areas that matter most to our customers: great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value. In the area of food, we have made progress toward enhancing the taste of our products and improving consumer perceptions of quality. Our core classics define the McDonald\u2019s brand. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve enhanced operational procedures. We are toasting buns longer, changing how we sear and grill burger patties to bring out the best in our menu and serve hotter, juicier sandwiches to our customers. We transition back to the original recipe for our Egg McMuffin, using butter instead of margarine to deliver an even tastier sandwich. Customers appreciated the change and we saw a double-digit increase in the number of Egg McMuffins sold immediately following the rollout. In August, we introduced the buttermilk chicken sandwich made with 100% chicken breast meat and real buttermilk. This new product complements our ongoing core menu emphasis and customers have responded favorably. Initial results have exceeded the high end of our expectations. And at the start of the fourth quarter, we rolled out all-day breakfast across the U.S. Customers have been asking for this for years and we\u2019ve challenged ourselves to move past legacy barriers to deliver and we did. Our ability to move from one market in May to all 14,000 restaurants, speaks to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system have been customer led in our decisions and our actions. We have also taken action to enhance our convenience and the overall customer experience. Early this year, we implemented operational procedures designed to improve order accuracy, remove some items in the menu and simplified the drive-through menu boards. Our goal is net simplification. We have established screens to evaluate operational complexity versus the expected impact on the customer and the business. And ultimately, we want to focus our efforts on fewer, bigger decisions that generate bigger rewards. We also took a first step toward enhancing the customer experience digitally with the deployment of the mobile application. To-date, there have been over 2 million downloads of the app and 1.5 million offers redeemed. We will begin national advertising later this month. Now, from a value standpoint, we are aligned lined with franchisees on the need for national value. The summer $2.50 Double Cheeseburger and Small Fry promotion was the first step. And we remain committed with operators in working towards restoring more permanent national value platforms in the future. Customers are noticing the differences. Our customer feedback system, which now tracks approximately 10 million customer touch points each year, reflects consistent improvement in customer feedback scores. We are seeing this across all key categories measured, with the most significant improvement seen in the areas we focused on namely, food quality, friendly and fast service and order accuracy. Let\u2019s now turn to the international lead markets segment starting with Australia. Third quarter marks four consecutive quarters of comparable sales and guest counts in Australia. The market turnaround began last year as the customers responded to the combined initiatives that collectively improved our overall experience. This included a renewed focus on improving operations, the added convenience of offering Barista crafted McCaf\u00e9 beverages through the drive-through and the stronger value platform with the re-launch of the Loose Change menu. This year, we have been giving customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu of breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including monopoly. National advertising of the Experience the Future, which includes self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service, and burger customization through Create Your Taste began July 1. While early, we are encouraged with the initial results and the positive buzz we have created in the market. And we\u2019re fueling that energy as we add chicken and salad offerings to the Create Your Taste platform later this month. Let\u2019s now turn to Germany, a market showing early signs of a turnaround. Customers are responding to the steps we have taken to enhance the appeal of premium products by emphasizing the provenance and sustainability of ingredients. The new clubhouse veggie sandwich in August, along with a re-hit of a proven customer favorite [indiscernible] contributed to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. And this month\u2019s launch of the McB, a premium burger that\u2019s made with 100% organic beef from farms in Germany and Austria reinforces food quality message to our customers. In France, we continue to maintain share despite the challenging macro environment and in a formal eating out market experiencing its fourth consecutive year of decline. Customers appreciate the actions we have taken to strengthen value at every price tier. This includes introducing McFirst earlier this year, a three item meal combination for under \u20ac5 and extending Petit plaisir across more product categories and dayparts. In addition, strong marketing campaigns including the Grand Premium and the American summer food events have successfully driven premium sandwich sales. We are also elevating the service experience by providing customers with new ways to order and be served in our restaurants. Self-order kiosks are now in more than 90% of French restaurants and we are now offering table service in more than half. Strong performance continues in the UK and Canada. These two market\u2019s ability to sustain prolonged growth is a direct result of their robust planning process, which directly links actions to the specific consumer needs. Strong quality campaigns in both markets are boosting customer perceptions of core classics and successful promotions, a new menu in use like the Chicken Legend in the UK and the new Mighty Angus in Canada have driven growth in premium products. Since Russia and China are two high growth markets of particular interest, let\u2019s spend a moment on them. Both markets posted positive comparable sales from the quarter as they recover from last year\u2019s well-documented issues. The team\u2019s execution against strong recovery plans with a comprehensive focus around great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value has successfully restored brand trust scores in both markets. However, we face near-term headwinds given an economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia. In addition to the operational elements of the turnaround plan, each market is executing around the globe, we continue a regular cadence of meaningful moves consistent with the leadership brand. We believe these moves will ultimately improve consumer perceptions of our brand. In September, we announced our plans in the U.S. to transition to cage free eggs over the next 10 years. More recently, we collaborated with a number of global brand leaders to raise awareness for the plight of refugees and the need to support the United Nation\u2019s World Food Program. And earlier this week, we announced our participation in the White House Climate Pledge. Turning around our business requires a relentless focus on what consumers want and expect from McDonald's. Our responsibility is to give them reasons to feel good about visiting time and again. Our opportunity is to differentiate McDonald's while delivering what consumers want today, while laying the foundation for what they would expect tomorrow and our commitment is to deliver on both. I am pleased with the progress we have made and remain confident in the ability of our talented system of franchisees, employees and suppliers to revitalize our connection with customers as we execute our turnaround plan into 2016. Thank you. And I will now hand it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Steve and hello, everyone. Today\u2019s earnings release marks our first quarterly reporting under the new segment structure. So I want to spend a few minutes outlining the new segments as a lead-in to my discussion of the factors that impacted the company\u2019s third quarter performance. Effective July 1, we completed an important first step in the company\u2019s global turnaround plan, the reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Our reporting segments now include the U.S., our largest individual market accounting for over 40% of consolidated operating income, the international lead segment, which includes our established markets of Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK that collectively account for about 40% of the company\u2019s operating income; the high-growth segment, which includes markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential, including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, these markets account for about 10% of the company\u2019s operating income and the foundational and corporate segment that encompasses the remaining markets. Each of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. These markets are combined with corporate activities for reporting purposes. From a business operation standpoint, this new structure brings similar markets together to leverage their collective insights and expertise to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. From a reporting standpoint, the new structure provides greater visibility into the key markets driving the vast majority of the company\u2019s underlying financial performance. So let\u2019s take a look at the major drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.31 to $1.40. In constant currencies, third quarter earnings per share increased $0.48. These results benefited from the comparison against prior year results, which included an increase in our tax reserves and the China supplier issue. These items negatively impacted third quarter 2014 earnings per share by $0.41. Excluding the impact of the unusual prior year items, third quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.07 or 5% in constant currencies. Looking beyond the unusual prior year items, third quarter global comparable sales were up 4% reflecting positive comparable sales across all segments and positive guest counts in all segments except the U.S. The international lead market segment was the largest contributor to the company\u2019s third quarter comparable sales performance, posting an increase of 4.6%, led by strong comparable sales and guest counts in Australia, the UK and Canada. Germany\u2019s results were uneven, but encouraging as the market posted positive comparable sales for the second consecutive quarter. And in France, comparable sales were marginally negative as the market\u2019s macroeconomic environment and informal eating out industry remained challenged. The high growth markets generated strong comparable sales of 8.9% for the quarter, reflecting sales recovery in both China and Russia. For perspective, China\u2019s comparable sales were up 26.8% for the quarter. The U.S. reported a comparable sales increase from 0.9% for the quarter, supported by the introduction of the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a return to the classic recipe for our Egg McMuffin. Comparable sales performance improved for the latter part of the quarter. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchised margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 7% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 20 basis points to 82.2%, driven by the positive comparable sales generated by the international segments. Global company operated margin dollars increased 9% in constant currencies to $675 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 10 basis points to 15.8%. China\u2019s sales recovery accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter, partly offset by ongoing labor costs in the U.S. The incremental labor costs in the U.S. related primarily to our decision to invest in our people by raising wages and providing paid time off for employees at our company operated restaurants, as well as providing educational assistance to all eligible U.S. restaurant employees effective July 1. These costs, along with wage increase have mandated by several states during the first half of the year, impacted third quarter U.S. margins by about 400 basis points. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose about 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. Our U.S. third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2%, which remains below food away from home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food away from home inflation for the full year remains at 2% to 3%. Commodity costs for the international lead markets segment were up about 0.5% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 2%. Moving down the P&L, G&A for the third quarter ended at $584 million, up 9% in constant currencies due entirely to higher incentive-based compensation accruals versus the prior year. Despite this unfavorable quarterly comparison, we are making progress against our previously announced savings target. Looking beyond the third quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind for the final quarter of 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world\u2019s other major currencies. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10. As usual, take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout the quarter. Before I conclude my remarks, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing our financial results in an outlook section. In light of our upcoming November Investor Meeting, we did not provide an update on our financial outlook in either today\u2019s prepared remarks or as part of today\u2019s 8-K filing. An update on these components will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in a few weeks. In closing, the transition in both our operating and reporting structure represents a new era for McDonald\u2019s as we move toward becoming a more focused and efficient organization. While we are less than six months into executing our turnaround plan, our third quarter results demonstrate early signs of progress with both our top and bottom line results. We are encouraged by this progress, but recognized that there is much more work to be done. As we begin fourth quarter, we are energized by the challenges in front of us. Thanks. And now I will turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nA - Chris Stent: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley: Good morning. Thank you. I would like to ask a about the U.S. all-day breakfast launch. I don\u2019t know if you can talk about the experience so far sales wise and whether you can talk about the sales or not, maybe talk about some of the operational issues, challenges and what you have learned kind of two weeks into the national launch?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, hi, Joe, Steve here. So, we launched officially nationwide on October 6, and I would say the enthusiasm levels from customers and from our teams in the restaurants are high. It\u2019s been a successful rollout. The owner/operators have really embraced this. I mean, to go from a test market in May to a nationwide rollout by October is a significant validation of the alignment of the operators behind this. When they approved it, they approved it with a 98% plus approval rating around the country. So, there is a lot of unity and alignment behind it. And from an operational perspective having spent a fair bit of time in the markets the last two or three weeks, the operators have been really again enthused at the fact that this has created - it\u2019s been a lot smoother from an operational perspective than perhaps people had feared. The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the training, the procedures is already very, very well-established in the restaurants. And by launching all-day breakfast, whilst at the same time removing some of the more complex lower sales items at the same time, we have a net simplification in the restaurants, and we have a \u2013 we are driving full. So, it\u2019s early days to give too much a read on sales, but we are certainly encouraged. And more importantly, the owner/operators are very encouraged about how we have kicked off.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAndy Barish: Hey, guys. Just on the U.S. margin side of the story, is that 400 basis points going to kind of continue on the labor line, just to try to get a sense of that investment over the next year or so?\nSteve Easterbrook: Hey, Andy. As we announced in April, we made this decision to invest in our people and raise wages, provide paid time off. And at that time, we indicated that we expected the impact of this as well as other state-mandated increases to be about 200 basis points on our margins for the full year this year. Since obviously the large majority of that impact happens in the second half of the year that implies that the impact on the second half would be substantially more than 200 basis points. So, the impact is relatively in line with our expectations. The payback from the investment will take a little time in terms of lowering turnover, having stronger employees, deliver a better customer experience ultimately driving top line sales. Moving forward, it will obviously continue to impact margin comparisons for the next three quarters until we lap the July 1. But as you know, margins are also significantly impacted by our top line. So, if we are able to generate higher comps that would certainly mitigate some of that impact.\nKevin Ozan: Andy, just to add on to that, just clearly there is the cost element, we try to be very transparent about that. Ultimately, the ambition from the move we have made is to just drive the experience in the restaurants and we see this as a meaningful move for us to be able to attract and retain the best talent in the marketplace. And if we can drive some efficiencies by reducing turnover which a motivated, committed workforce tend to reduce the turnover levels, we maybe able to get some benefit if it come backs from that. But I just wanted to broaden out the conversation, because yes, there is a cost, but frankly, this is part of the bigger picture, running better restaurants, motivated teams and committed crew.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nBilly Sherrill: Yes, thanks guys. It\u2019s actually Billy on for Will. Just wondering if now that we have a new reporting structure, if you could just kind of walk us through some of the cadence and I guess distribution I guess of the refranchising initiatives and maybe some of the new store openings across each segment?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. So, you can see the actual new store openings within each segment in the back of the earnings release. As far as moving forward and how kind of capital and refranchising and new openings may happen in the future, we will talk about that more in the upcoming investor meeting in November.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Looking back at the summer \u201811 value menu, could you just comment as to where that did work, where it didn\u2019t work, some of the lessons of that? And separately, the simplification of the menu in the U.S, it seems to be something that\u2019s more to come. Where do you stand on that? And where do you see that going forward? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, hi David. So, from the value program across the sub, I think on the call last quarter, acknowledge that it got off to a little bit of a bumpy start as we launched it, it was in a way bumping into some of the local value initiatives that each of the regions were driving, which made \u2013 and then we reset and the performance of the $2.50 double cheese and small fry improved across the summer as the focus got clearer and our execution in the restaurants got sharper. So, it filled the gap for us. We do have a desire, along with our owner/operators of a more sustained value platform, which we will be looking to introduce through 2016, but it certainly played a meaningful role across the summer helping to drive the footfall. In terms of simplification, I just \u2013 again, simplification in the way we are looking at this and the way the team in the U.S. is looking at it is, menu is part of it, but there is a lot more we can do to help simplify the restaurants on a day-to-day basis, both from a customer perspective, but also from our managers and our crew. So, there is operational simplification, there is training simplification. There is things we can do with merchandising to make it easier for customers and navigate the restaurants and also with packaging as well. So, the team, there were sub-teams that are addressing each of these areas of opportunity. So, yes, menu is one piece, but the whole operational complexity, the training and merchandising and packaging is another. And it\u2019s the sum of those parts is what manages and begin to recognize that we are working hard to make their life a little easier, so they can just focus on what they love to do which is just running the restaurants and serving customers.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. The question is that you guys cite that the chicken item was \u2013 which I think most of us perceive to be somewhat premium was a successful driver and welcomed by the American consumer and the part of their recovery and the comp going positive. But a lot of the attention has been mentioned about sort of the value consumer and the value coming down. And there are some votes coming now on the new value menu in the weeks ahead. I am just curious, is this \u2013 has this experience maybe emboldened you to think there is and the new product innovation might be a little more skewing towards the premium side or how should we look at the \u2013 where the easiest opportunity is to recover if the consumer that might be in the near-term lapse and you can get back quicker and what would be the thing of the marketing they\u2019d respond to the most of, would you think it will be premium or value?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Thanks for the question. And again, the way we look at this is how can we deliver the best value across all tiers on that menu. So you are actually right with the buttermilk chicken. That was premium product, premium quality and a premium price that goes with it. And because of the taste, because of the quality and the execution of restaurants, their customers really did respond well. And as I said earlier, it\u2019s got outperformance at the high end of our expectations. But I think you would see, as we build our calendars out across any of our markets, but certainly here in the U.S, we do want to \u2013 we want to provide the best value of each level, great value core products, great value premium. And probably one of the areas where we are still a little weaker is at that more entry level, value level. And that\u2019s what you have been hearing about. And that\u2019s what \u2013 we are working with the operators on and the operators are aligning behind what they believe will be strong platform as we enter 2016 to help drive the foothold. Because we know that the top line going into positive territory was encouraging for us. There is no doubt about that. Our ultimate measure of success will be serving more customers more often and that\u2019s getting the guest counts moving as well.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust.\nJake Bartlett: Thanks for taking the question. Just to gauge the kind of the core, the turnaround in the U.S. aside from the breakfast all day, when do you think that the fourth quarter in the U.S. will be positive even without the breakfast all day introduction?\nSteve Easterbrook: It\u2019s a difficult one to read. I mean what I would say is what has given me the most satisfaction from the way that the team have galvanized themselves in the U.S. is actually we are running better restaurants than we were a year ago. So if \u2013 and that is ultimately what customers respond to. And then as we innovate around the menu and have promotional activity and have fun with that, that would increment the sales, but running better restaurants day in and day out. And customers are telling us through this kind of very material feedback loop we have now that we are \u2013 they are noting the changes in the areas that mattered most to them, which is speed, friendliness and accuracy. Through the quarter, it\u2019s probably fair to say we ended the quarter just a little stronger than we started. But I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I mean, turnarounds are about momentum and we want to establish momentum over the short-term, medium-term and long-term. We have got one \u2013 we put one mark around that. And as we start to build quarter-upon-quarter, you will be able to read that no more underlying momentum in the business. But running better restaurants is a great start, shopping up our merchandising, simplifying the drive for operation, underpins everything else we are doing. So I feel good about that.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask about some of the high growth markets. Obviously very, very strong comps out of China and it sounds like Russia also, I guess a couple of questions. One is you did mention that some near-term headwinds from volatility, but certainly \u2013 or a slowdown in the economy. But certainly, that wouldn\u2019t have appeared to be the case in the quarter. So I just wanted to ask about that comment. And also the margins there, again on such high comps, they might have expected even more margin expansion, can you just talk about, is that your emphasis on value in that market and clearly, again, with such strong comps, the right trade-off to make. But is that what we are seeing there. And I guess, last piece on that segment is, I think you are targeting more of a franchise mix. So is it safe to assume that most of the refranchising that you have laid out will come in China and Russia or a disproportionate amount? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: I think probably both Kevin and I will have a go on that one, Sara, there is a fair bit in there. So China clearly, took a hit third quarter last year. We expected a return to growth clearly. And we are pleased we did. I have got to say, I am very proud of the team in China. I am going to say I am very proud of the change in China because they were in a very difficult situation a year ago. And they said after facing a two-pronged approach to recover the business momentum. One was around trading hard and particularly trading hard on value. And the second one was restoring brand trust. And actually, in that market now, our trust metrics are higher than they were prior to the supplier incidents a year ago. So I think that kind of validate the focus they have put on there. As we look forward, there are probably four elements the team are working on across the next couple of quarters, continuing on brand trust, consist everyday value at the entry and mid-tier levels. They have got a big an exciting play around convenience and particular around digital activation and delivery. So those are two drivers that aren\u2019t unique to China, but are very material to the consumer in China. Digital activation, working with some of main tech partners in China, we got some great relationships there and a very strong delivery business. And the full fun is just around consumer excitement, just having fun with products and the experience in the restaurants. So we \u2013 I don\u2019t want anyone to think that just because we were down last year, you would ultimately bounce back. You have got to work hard for it. The team have worked for it. And net-net, if you look at the 2-year comp, we were slightly up across that 2-year period, which across that quarter, which I think is credit to the team.\nKevin Ozan: Let me touch on margins and franchising. Related to margins in that group, a couple of things. One, certainly China\u2019s margins were covered in this quarter versus last year as a result of their sales recovery. Russia has currency pressure. We import a chunk of our food and paper in Russia both in terms of dollar and euro. And so there is still pressure on Russia\u2019s margins because of those imported food and paper costs. So that\u2019s still putting pressure on the margins within the high growth segment. Related to franchising, I think we have said that most of our franchising opportunities, certainly it\u2019s probably within Asia. So China certainly, would be a part of that. We will update a little bit more of our detailed franchising plans as we get to the investor meeting in November. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that the high-growth segment which certainly have franchising activity going forward.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse: Hi, thank you for the question. I not only originally started talking about some of the wage increases at your stores. My understanding was they are going to be phased in towards $10 over a period of year. So once we get, is that correct, once we get to sort of the four out of the 200 basis points, how to think about sort of the next, quantifying the next side of that. And then also, on the franchise side of this system, what sort of pressure might they be seeing on their margins right now from just overall wage pressures in the environment or is it another way to look at that just rate general wage inflation rates?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Karen, the plan what was never to phase in kind of these increases. We did an increase across the board in July really impacting kind of all other the restaurants. So our average rate right now at our company operated restaurants is nearly $10 right now. And so I wouldn\u2019t see a significant additional phasing in above and beyond kind of where we are right now. Certainly, as state mandate changes, we may have to adjust to some of those. But there isn\u2019t another wave in our plans to go in and kind of it all restaurants again.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you. I want to understand a little bit more of where you are taking shares from. And I am not sure these are the buckets you would define it. But may you could adjust accordingly. But by \u2013 in order of magnitude, do you think that you are and can continue to pick up share from C stores or is it other legacy large QSR players or is it from consumers eating at home? Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: So, this is a U.S. question, I am assuming, Nicole?\nNicole Miller Regan: Yes.\nSteve Easterbrook: So, I will answer on that basis. Well, I think our immediate term is to win back share from the nearer term competition. That\u2019s what we are focused on. And then as we build out our experience in the future, I think that will get us \u2013 that will make us more attractive to a broader set of customers. But at the moment, I would say nearer term traditional competition is the market share we are biting at the moment. And clearly, we are playing to our strengths. Breakfast has always been a historic strength and we continue to do very well at breakfast during the breakfast daypart, but now into other dayparts as well.\nKevin Ozan: And just as an additional perspective, for the third quarter, our comp GAAP was a negative 3.2%. So, we still have room certainly to increase that. That\u2019s substantially down from Q2 and Q1. That\u2019s QSR sandwich category that it\u2019s against, but we certainly have opportunity and we have been seeing a few recent weeks kind of the opposite where we have been out comping some of that same competition.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: The U.S. segment, operating income was still down a little bit, even though comps turned positive and that\u2019s obviously because of all the investments you are making, but as you look out towards the next 6 to 12 months given the way you are thinking about cost, what type of same-store sales growth do we need to see some positive operating income growth to that overall segment? How are you thinking about that?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Brian. We had a little difficulty hearing, but I think you are asking about kind of the U.S. comp and what we would need potentially to maintain or grow margins there. So, we obviously talked about the labor costs that are impacting the U.S. We have said in a normal inflationary environment, we generally need a 2% to 3% comp in the U.S. to maintain margins. With these additional labor costs, certainly the comp needed to maintain margins in the near-term would be higher than that. Commodities right now aren\u2019t a big pressure on us. And so commodities really aren\u2019t the concern. It\u2019s more of a comp needed to kind of overcome these near-term labor costs.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter. Just a question on all-day breakfast, I guess on any early read in terms of what your preliminary estimates might be on the comp benefit from the rollout? And I guess just maybe any early read on what kind of customer you are getting buying breakfast? Is it a new customer? Is it a cannibalizing sale? Any color there would be great.\nSteve Easterbrook: I really don\u2019t want to give too much guidance here, Karen, not to be evasive, but just when you are a first couple of weeks in and we have got a lot of media behind it I don\u2019t want to give a wrong read. We are starting higher as you would expect out the box than what we would expect our steady run-rate to be when things settle down, but we see it being incremental profitable business that is driving existing customers in more often and attracting new customers. So, the anecdotals I get as I move around the country and getting to the restaurants is though if you are in a shoot in town, you are seeing a lot, a lot of activity into the evenings and the overnights around breakfast items that is just cultish amongst the students, but you can go directional mid-afternoon to see a more mature group that we are sitting there who can now enjoy the product with Egg McMuffin mid-afternoon and having to watch \u2013 clock watching and try and make the 10:30 a.m. deadline. So, it\u2019s just makes life easier for customers. They don\u2019t have to look at the watch and managed too hard their time. So, broad appeal, a strong start from an operational perspective, from an execution perspective and I think the team has done a great job from the marketing launch and just having some fun with it. I mean, more than anything else, it\u2019s fun. Customers are enjoying it and so our teams and restaurants.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.\nKeith Siegner: Thank you. Congratulations. So, is this momentum in the U.S. hopefully, it builds off all of the stuff from ops, new products, value digital messaging, all this. How do you feel about the status of the U.S. asset base? And the opportunity maybe to kind of re-image into this momentum and even further bolster it? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: So, you said the work here. And the most important word, I think in any consumer base of business or any retail is momentum. And momentum breached confidence, confidence breached \u2013 it becomes a virtual cycle of success, if you like. And we are just beginning to feel some early signs of that and you can see the confidence flowing through the restaurants and through the teams. So, clearly, for a turnaround, you want sustained growth. And we have slowed by delivered one quarter. So, this is one data point, but the steps that we have taken to get to here are steps they are going to continue to keep supporting our business going forward.\nKevin Ozan: And one of the opportunities you mentioned, Keith, certainly is as you know, we are only about 50% re-imaged in the U.S. And so there is certainly opportunity going forward to more modernized that asset base in the U.S. and make sure that we have got the right facilities to bring in the customers that we want through on the cash.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Steve, I have a question or maybe a clarification on how you are thinking about the improvement you have seen in the U.S. business so far. And I guess specifically on the Q3 improvement as it seems like it got better as the quarter progressed. Do you think that was more about the new product news that you had or the structural improvements you are making in the restaurants with respect to operations? And then maybe as part of your answer to that, if you could touch on what the metrics look like on feed of service now that you simplified the drive through menu?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. I think there are number of ingredients that are beginning to come together. If you remember from the past, the U.S. undertook a fairly significant structural change itself. Now, about a year ago, where we eliminated and they are liberated a little more entrepreneurial spirit into the regions, that takes time to settle down. You can\u2019t just hit your stride straightaway. So, I think as the regions and the teams in the regions begin to find their feet as it were, that helps. I don\u2019t want to underestimate just the investments we are making in food quality. The investments that consumers care about such as the announcement to go to free range eggs, for example, such as the quality cues that you deliver with a buttermilk chicken. I mean, that is getting strong. But underpinning it and I will never ever move away from this, any market that\u2019s successful around the world is because they are focusing on the day-to-day operation and just delivering at that moment of truth for the customer. That is what McDonald\u2019s is all about. What we are seeing with speed of service? Well, actually, we are seeing greater improvement in the accuracy. So, accuracy is probably the strongest metric improvement we are getting, which on the basis that about 70% of the business goes to the drive-through. Clearly, accuracy is particularly important. But we begin to see a few seconds being shaved our average service times as we simplify the menu and sharpening up the operations, but it\u2019s early days and we have got \u2013 there is a lot more progress we want to make, I have got to say that.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. My question has to do with the new operating segments, particularly outside the United States, can you \u2013 on two items. Can you talk about is this what the cost savings opportunities you are discovering are? It looks like G&A in many of those segments are lower, but maybe you are just picking it up on the corporate or you are actually finding real opportunities to consolidate some of those into the new structure? And from an operating standpoint, given your first quarter of operating into these different segments, are there examples of where you are operating the restaurants differently, because different leaderships looking at these markets differently or is that too early to really say?\nKevin Ozan: Alright. I will start with the cost item and I will let Steve talk about kind of the leadership and running the markets differently. Couple of things going on here. One, you may have seen and it may have been a little confusing, but we tried to explain one of the things that\u2019s gone on is we are moving a little bit from a very decentralized structure to one that centralizes certain non-customer facing functions and activities. So, along with that, some costs that historically were managed at a segment level now are being managed or will be managed at a central corporate level. So, some of the costs that were reflected last year in the segments are now in corporate, about $30 million of those in total of those costs. That doesn\u2019t impact consolidated or total G&A. That\u2019s more of just a reallocation. At the same time, we obviously talked about saving real consolidated G&A. And as I said, we are making progress on that and we will give a further update on those activities and the investor meeting in November.\nKevin Ozan: And John, I will just talk about, if you like the operating segments and just the way the leadership teams are thinking. And we will certainly give more flavor to this in our investor meeting. But if I would just to take the lead market as an example, we have got the five major countries that contribute to the lead markets. They are overseen by a team of just three people. Now these are three very senior, highly talented individuals. But the decision making \u2013 and the feasibility into those five markets is so much clearer because we have removed the layers that tend to just obscure what\u2019s going on. So if those three leaders can see something work in Australia. Our ability to share that with the Canadians, whether it\u2019s the UK, German, France team and vice versa, obviously it\u2019s far clearer. So the speed of the decision making, visibility into what\u2019s working, visibility to what\u2019s not working and just sharing that knowledge and getting to market quicker with things that work, we are already seeing the benefits of that. And I think that\u2019s incredibly encouraging, because we have always had pockets of excellence. I want fewer pockets of excellence, I want a broader base excellence, so I believe this structure will help you deliver that.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer: Thanks. Sorry if I missed the question, I am actually multitasking myself. But given the importance of a national price pointed value platform that you guys have discussed in the past, can you walk us through the steps you could take to potentially make that happen. I guess what I mean by that is any potential timeline for formulation of the menu testing of that menu and then assuming you are happy with the results, potentially, how quickly should we see a broad based national price pointed value platform hit the U.S?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. So I mean the process that I am showing you a fairly familiar here in the U.S. is somewhat unique compared to other markets around the world, because it\u2019s, by nature, a more complex and diverse market side here in the U.S. We are at the stage now where driven by insights, we have created a number of potential concepts. Some of those are in test already, but they are being discussed and being aborted on for approvals and discussed by the operators now. So the national teams have had more rigor around it and challenged it and have come up with really strong, could be strong compelling. The operators discussing that and they will make the right decision because the most important piece is alignment. And we have got great alignment now as a result of all-day breakfast. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s part of the magic ingredient that McDonald\u2019s here in the U.S. and the alignment with the owner operators. And I know that doing the right thing working through it and certainly into next year, will be a line \u2013 there will be something that we believe will be competitive from a customer perspective.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Howard Penney at Hedgeye.\nHoward Penney: Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Steve, you used the phrase net simplification a couple of times I think in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could explain that term, I know you have talked about simplification before, but what does net simplification mean and how much more is there to go?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. I would tell you, Howard and thank you for the question because I have strong conviction of around simplifying our restaurant operations, because I believe the customer is the ultimate beneficiary. And then, when we do talk about doing something like an all-day breakfast, people scratching their head and say, well hold on a minute. You told about simplification, but now you are adding. So when I talk about net. I am saying we go t to take more complexity out through our decision -making that we ever put in, so that\u2019s where one kind of \u2013 my language of net simplification works. So if we are not adding any new SKUs into the restaurant for breakfast because all the ingredients are already there. They are in the chillers, they are in the freezers, the equipment is already in place. So yes, there is the operational shift running. There is an operational complexity, but not an ingredient complexity. In the meantime, around the country, we have \u2013 the U.S. team has been very rigorous in their analytics on this and helping provide each and every color with a tool that helps them assess operational complexity versus contribution to product mix and margin. And then as a final screen which is around the brand value. So that\u2019s helps \u2013 have actual detailed insight and rigor around supporting the costs taking items off. So on average, right I think you need at the start of the year, we removed around 7 items from the menu. It\u2019s probably at leased another seven, if not more on average across the comps around the country now. And I know they are continuing on this path. And as we offer more abilities to customize and personalize food going forward, that may give us another opportunity to actually take further items on. So I hope that makes sense. The trouble saying simplification is definitely whenever you do [indiscernible] say on a hold a minute and making more complex. We are not going to be static. We are going to be energetic. We will innovate. We will have new products. It\u2019s fun and that\u2019s what customers want. We have got to make sure that we take more than that out of the restaurant complexity. So I hope that makes a little more sense.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andrew Charles at Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you. Just on the improved order accuracy in the U.S., how do you plan to sustain this improvement as customization and personalization will become increasingly component of the experience as of the case in Australia, obviously digital initiatives can be a big help, but any other factors that we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. I think two-pronged again, just from the day-to-day operation with our teams in the field, it\u2019s around trading. And the training that was rolled out across of the U.S., which was actually was an operator lead initiative initially, was around something called ask us teller. The way that we reconfigured our own internal procedures of how we take the orders, confirm the orders and then present the orders. And that has had a positive notable benefit in our accuracy. As we go forward, the more of that heavy lifting that we can get technology to do and the greater our accuracy will become. So whether it\u2019s ordering through apps, whether it\u2019s ordering it through self-order kiosks that we see elsewhere around the world, technology can certainly help us with putting the customer in charge of the ordering process and allowing technology to do the heavy lifting and then we can just prepare the food and serve it in a friendly way, so two pronged. We will never get away from day-to-day training. But secondly, we are working hard on the technology to help support this.\nChris Stent: We have time for one more question. Next in the queue is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just two follow-ups, one on the all-day breakfast, I know there has been lots of questions on the topic, I am just wondering being that you had at least some tests for a while was there any color in terms of what type of lift you might have seen in test market or maybe what that mix has gone to in that test market. And the other question was just on \u2013 you mentioned you had commodity costs. So it sounds like beef isn\u2019t that onerous and I think you said the overall basket was only up 1% this past quarter. I am just wondering what your thoughts are as we look ahead and whether that could actually \u2013 do you think qualitatively that would impact McDonald\u2019s or maybe the industry as you think about promotions and discounting and your new value platform potentially?\nSteve Easterbrook: Okay. I will take the first one, Jeff. So I am a fairly resilient guy. I won\u2019t get worn down by the same question kind of asked different direction. But I appreciate the interest. And of course we are as well. What I would say is the test markets gave us that kind of \u2013 that curve of initial launch volumes and then the settling down sustaining because that being trade to the business case that then got the buying from the broader operating community. So we are confident in the kind of the curve we expect to see of the contribution of all-day breakfast. We are encouraged that it\u2019s 30 days. We are sitting here today, 15 or 16 days in. And I can tell you that the unity of the system around this and the responsible customers, which is the important piece is very positive. We will get share a bit more in November, obviously. Totally understand the interest in it. But it\u2019s just too early. It just wouldn\u2019t be fair to give a read on it right now.\nKevin Ozan: And then related to the commodity costs in the U.S. yes, we said it was up about 1%, primarily beef costs, not a lot of commodity pressure on the other commodities in the third quarter. Going forward again, what the rest of the outlook stuff since it\u2019s all interconnected, we will provide an update at our upcoming investor meeting related to kind of how things look in the future.\nChris Stent: We are near the top of the hour. So I will turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Thank you, Chris. And again, thanks for everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to emphasize our commitment across of the entire system to consistently running great restaurants to give our customers even more reasons to dine at McDonald\u2019s. We are focusing on executing fewer, bigger initiatives that will ultimately deliver better experience for our guests around the areas that matter most to the great-tasting food, fast friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald\u2019s. The progress we have made in a short amount of time gives me confidence that we are making the right moves to turnaround our business and reposition McDonald\u2019s as a modern, progressive burger company. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also applies to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. In May, I shared the initial steps we are taking to fundamentally reset McDonald\u2019s business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we have made since then. Our turnaround plan represents a significant step change in McDonald\u2019s and establishes the foundation for our transformation as we work toward becoming a modern progressive burger company. Our number one priority is to return critical markets to sustainable growth by regaining customers\u2019 trust and loyalty. These efforts must be led by the markets, local management and franchisees working together to deliver what people want from McDonald\u2019s, great tasting, quality food at a value, delivered with a better service each and every time they visit. Our focus over the last several months has been execution, transformation and challenging the organization to evolve more quickly, taking bold steps to change the way we think and operate starting first with our structure. We made a fundamental shift in a way our business is organized effective July 1 to eliminate redundancies, maximize talent and create a greater sense of urgency amongst companies and operator leadership staff as well as with our suppliers. This restructure arguably represents the biggest organizational change in our history yet from inception to execution we completed it in just two months. It requires significant change inside the company. And we are already realizing some of the benefits, stronger discipline, sharper customer focus, a more acute sense of urgency and a deeper understanding of what legacy thinking and actions to challenge and how. For example, market teams in Australia and Hong Kong have recognized and acted upon the needs of a greater choice in personalization with our hallmark product, burgers. We are aggressively deploying elements of experience in the future and seeing encouraging results. And in Germany, our brand re-launch highlighting new taste and a better overall restaurant experience is giving customers reasons to think differently about McDonald\u2019s. We have also recruited fresh outside perspectives as part of this restructure. Our new Chief Communications Officer, Robert Gibbs and Chief Marketing Officer, Silvia Lagnado, are highly respected talented leaders who will bring a wealth of experience and outside perspective. In the next several months, we are about taking further action and reasserting our leadership. We must operate better restaurants. That\u2019s why we are recommitting to operations excellence, which frankly has been lacking in some markets. Simply speaking, we need to be better at serving hot fresh food, providing fast and friendly service in a contemporary restaurant at the value of McDonald\u2019s. Today, I will highlight the steps we are taking and the progress we have made. While financial results remained disappointing in the second quarter, we are seeing early signs of momentum. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect positive global comparable sales led by growth in our newly created international lead market segment and China\u2019s continuing recovery in the 2014 APMEA supplier issue. Before we turn to the U.S., let me briefly highlight the progress we are making in some of our most significant markets around the world. I am energized that the actions our markets are taking and the impact they have on results. As we translate our progress into the context of our new organizational structure, I can say with confidence that the international lead market segments, which represents approximately 40% of our business is moving in the right direction. Australia, Canada and the UK continued to deliver strong performance. Germany is starting to turn and France is gaining share despite the challenging headwinds. This segment will be a strong catalyst for our business. Let\u2019s start with Australia, where June marks 10 consecutive months of positive comparable sales and guest counts. The business has turned in Australia and the market is focused on sustaining positive performance. The combined solutions deployed last year, such as re-launching everyday value with the loose change menu and offering customers Barista crafted McCaf\u00e9 beverages in the drive-through established the foundation and Australia has successfully layered on incremental initiatives to sustain that growth. Value breakfast was introduced early this year and we began national advertising for Create Your Taste customized burgers as part of our efforts to develop the customer experience in the future. The UK also continues to grow, with 37 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales performance. Multiple initiatives contributed to growth and market share gains across all dayparts. For example, we gave customers more reasons to visit our restaurants by featuring premium products, such as the Chicken Legend and Big Tasty and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including Monopoly. Strong growth in breakfast was fueled by the market\u2019s first ever promotional breakfast item, the sausage and bacon sandwich. And the team is improving the service experience by aggressively deploying Experience of the Future. 150 restaurants we converted so far and plans were in place to double that number by the end of 2015. Let\u2019s now shift to Canada, where positive comparable sales performance continues. The team is driving growth by focusing on convenience, including the ongoing rollout of dual-lane drive-throughs, which improve the speed of service for customers, particularly during our busiest times. The market is also benefiting from strong breakfast growth building up on a successful free coffee offer earlier this year, along with additional enhancements to the core menu, including new salads. We are also seeing signs of progress in Germany. This was the market\u2019s first quarter of positive comparable sales since the second quarter 2012. Customers are responding to the steps we have taken to improve the taste and variety of core and premium products, such as the new premium bacon clubhouse range and the [world][ph] couture promotion that feature locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. And I am excited to announce today \u2013 about the announcements today of our developmental licensee agreements with Autobahn Tank & Rast. This agreement gives us the opportunity to develop more than 100 new sites in fuel and service stations across the lucrative motorway service station network in Germany, with no capital investment required by McDonald\u2019s. The first new restaurants are expected to open this year with the majority opening between 2016 and 2019. Moving to China, one of our high growth markets, recovery continues from last year supplier issue. Comparable sales remained negative in the second quarter at minus 3%. However, the top five cities, which represent about 50% of sales, are leading the recovery effort with flat comparable sales for the quarter. Lower tier cities are not recovering as quickly driven primarily by weaker macroeconomic conditions in those outlying areas. China is strengthening everyday value with a specific focus on the mid-tier price points, continuing to enhance convenience for our customers through delivery and kiosks and elevating the quality perceptions of our burgers by piloting customization through experience of the future. We are on track to return to a normalized level of performance in China for the second half of the year. In fact, prior to the anniversary of last year\u2019s APMEA supplier issue, the market has already returned to positive comparable sales performance in the first part of this month. Let\u2019s now transition to the U.S., which represents over 40% of our business. Results here have been disappointing. We are committed to changing the trajectory of the business and arresting the nearly 3 years of decline. We are working to promote discipline back into the business, adapt more quickly to changing trends, offer more compelling value across the menu, and bringing new energy and tenacity to simply running better restaurants. The localized structure implemented early this year was an important first step. It\u2019s designed to liberate market teams to be more responsive to local consumers and we have seen pockets of success. The Northwest region, for example, was the country\u2019s top performing region in 2014 and continues to generate positive results year-to-date here. A strong restaurant operations culture, coupled with an aggressive promotions like any size soft drink or coffee for a $1 is generating incremental traffic. The Heartland region, which includes Kansas City is also delivering comparable sales and guest count performance above U.S. averages. There, a heavy breakfast focus, coupled with a modernized restaurant base has fueled momentum. And Boston, which is coming back from the worst winter in its history has deployed a combination of regional products like the lobster roll, a $2.99 Happy Meal to attract families and beverage value to drive sales and guest counts. The U.S. is focused on creating a better experience for customers by concentrating on value, service and menu. These are not headline grabbing moves, but they became the return to running better restaurants. So first, getting back to winning on value. Having aligned with our franchisees on the need for national price pointed value platform, we are now making adjustments to our current offer for the rest of the summer. This includes better marketing support and stronger coordination with local messages. We are also evaluating options for longer-term national value platform. Next, we are enhancing the customer service experience. This starts with the basics. We have reduced the number of menu items in restaurants to make it easier for teams to deliver better service. We are improving the speed of our drive-throughs with simplified menu boards. We have cut the number of items displayed by about a third, yet still highlight the items to deliver 80% or more of drive-through sales. We are addressing order accuracy with new operational procedures and training programs already in almost half of our restaurants. And we are increasing the number of dual line drive-through to deliver faster service to our customers during the busiest times of the day. I will be launching our mobile app in the U.S. in the third quarter. This is part of our global digital strategy that over time is designed to streamline and improve the entire customer service experience. The initial version of the app will make it easy for consumers to receive value when they choose McDonald\u2019s through features like tail adopters that are easy to redeem and rewards for regular purchases of their favorite McCaf\u00e9 beverages. And at the same time, the team is already hard at work, developing additional features to hasten the shift from mass communication to personal one-to-one engagement with customers in the future. And finally menu, this starts with our call products that define our brands. We have implemented new cooking methods in our restaurant, so we are seeing strong growth changing how we sear and grill our beef to deliver hotter, juicier sandwiches. And we are looking to further improve performance during our most successful dayparts. For example, our all-day breakfast trials have gone well, so we have expanded those tests to better gauge customer response. I believe we are making the right moves to begin to stabilize the U.S. business. But there is no silver bullet. No one move will turn a business that\u2019s been in decline for nearly 3 years and more recovery will be bumpy on comfortably moving in the right direction. While our primary focus is on actions that will drive operating growth, we have also taken steps to unlock financial value. On May 4, we identified key areas of focus to unlock that financial value. In just two months, we have made good progress towards all our targets including G&A, refranchising and cash return. Kevin will provide more details specific to those in a moment. In closing, I remain confident in the power of our brand and our network of franchisees, employees and suppliers to capitalize on the growth opportunities before us. It\u2019s not enough to say that we want to be a modern progressive burger company consumers need to see us that way. Shifting deep-seated perceptions the longer term proposition, it requires us to move across negative barriers and embrace behaviors of a true global leader. We have made significant progress in a short amount of time. And I am confident the changes we are making are the right ones will position us to grow the business profitably for our system and our shareholders for the long-term. Thank you. And I will now turn over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. I would like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance. Then I will review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing the major drivers of our second quarter results. Our overall financial performance continues to be largely reflective of our top line results. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 0.7% reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments, with the largest impact coming from the U.S. and Japan. For perspective, operating income for the quarter totaled $1.8 billion, down $127 million or 6% in constant currency. The U.S. and Japan accounted for over 80% of the quarter\u2019s overall operating income decline. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.8 billion, a 2% increase in constant currencies. The growth in franchise margins was driven primarily by restaurant expansion in Europe and strong comparable sales in Australia. Global company operating margin dollars declined 8% in constant currencies to $665 million for the quarter, reflecting weakness across our major geographic segments. The U.S., Russia and China accounted for substantially all of the margin declines for the quarter. Second quarter cost pressures were relatively consistent with our expectations. In the U.S., labor costs increased primarily due to planned minimum wage increases in several states and commodity costs rose approximately 1% primarily due to higher beef prices. Effective July 1, U.S. company operating margins will also reflect our decisions to raise wages and provide paid time-off for employees at our company operated restaurants, along with providing educational assistance for all our restaurant employees. We expect the total impact from these incremental labor costs to be approximately 200 basis points on U.S. company-operated margins for the full year, further pressuring margins for the second half of 2015. To help offset cost pressures throughout our P&L and remain in line with food inflation, we took a price increase at the end of May. Our U.S. second quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in the food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remains at 2% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe\u2019s commodity costs were up about 2% in the second quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by markets with the overall segment excluding Russia averaging about 1.5% year-over-year. For the quarter, we also recorded nearly $50 million of other operating expense, primarily due to $45 million of severance charges in connection with the restructuring of our global operations. About half of these charges were incurred within our corporate functions and the other half in Europe and APMEA as we move to a flatter, more nimble organizational structure. Moving down the P&L, it\u2019s worth noting our second quarter effective tax rate of 29.8%, which was helped by lower tax costs associated with the company\u2019s ongoing foreign cash repatriation. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be at the high end of our existing 31% to 33% range. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.26, which included a significant negative impact of $0.13 from foreign currency. Looking beyond the second quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind throughout 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world other major currencies. At these levels, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.14 to $0.16 in the third quarter and about $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take that as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Let me switch gears now for an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. In May, we announced our intent to accelerate our cash return to shareholders in 2015. During the second quarter, we returned $2.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through June to $3.9 billion and we remain on track to meet our target of $8 billion to $9 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and increased overall debt by issuing $4.3 billion of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated medium-term notes, with an average tenure of over 10 years and an average interest rate of just over 2%. Our overall philosophy on use of cash has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we execute the initial steps of our turnaround plan, we are actively evaluating our capital allocation decisions, including our dividend as part of our broader strategic planning process. As a result, we are targeting our annual dividend announcement in November this year, a slight change in timing from our typical September update. One of the key areas of focus for the turnaround is better leveraging our business model, including the benefits of franchising. In conjunction with our goal to re-franchise about 3,500 restaurants by the end of 2018 and increase the global franchise percentage to about 90%, we are already moving forward in several markets, including Taiwan, where we recently announced our intent to pursue a developmental licensee structure. Taiwan is a well-established market, with more than 400 restaurants, the vast majority of which are company-operated. While we are in the early stages of the process, the conversion of this market to a developmental license will mark a meaningful step towards our overall refranchising goals. The structural changes to our organization and our ownership mix not only better position us for future growth they will also deliver savings to our bottom line. Earlier this month, we made important changes in our corporate and segment support teams, which included the elimination of some international and home office positions. While these types of changes are never easy, they were right for the business and will result in a leaner, more agile organization that can better respond to market conditions, and most importantly, our customers. The rapid execution of these resourcing decisions is an example of our sense of urgency to reset our business and changes the trajectory of our financial performance. When we shared the initial details of our turnaround plan in May, we established a target to achieve $300 million of net annual G&A savings. We expect to achieve about half of those overall savings by the end of next year with the remainder realized by the end of 2017. Our planned refranchising activity is contributing towards these G&A savings due to the less resource-intensive support structure inherent in a more heavily franchised model. Importantly, we are not stopping there. We are moving to the next phase of our analysis relative to each of the financial areas of opportunity, including ownership strategies, asset optimization and overall spending. We plan to provide an update on all of these areas at the November Investor Meeting. The July 1 reorganization of our business into the new segment structure is an important first step in our global turnaround. In conjunction with these changes, we will be providing recapped financial information that reflects results under this new structure. We expect to furnish our recapped summary financial information toward the end of third quarter for the years 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details will be provided for 2014 and year-to-date June 2015. In closing, let me reiterate that we are fundamentally shifting the way we operate and approach our business to get back in step with consumers. McDonald\u2019s success has always been fueled by outstanding operations, compelling marketing and great tasting food. We operate under a unique business model that benefits from a highly collaborative relationship among the company, independent franchisees and third-party suppliers, all who take pride in their businesses. We need all of these elements working together to provide a world-class experience that makes our customers feel welcome and valued. Our turnaround plan is designed to fortify these fundamental cornerstones of our business. And our operational growth led turnaround will also be supported by a comprehensive approach to financial management that\u2019s focused on driving value for our system and our shareholders today and into the future. Thanks. And now I will turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nA - Chris Stent: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you very much. Good morning. Question here, Steve, you talked about the early signs of momentum now with the second quarter results behind you. You pointed to the fact that you expect positive comparable sales on a global basis in the third quarter. How much of this improvement you are seeing is really the comparison in the Eastern Asia and the better trends in Europe versus any core improvements that you are now seeing since the second quarter in the U.S. sales trend if any? And I do have a follow-up on that if you don\u2019t mind.\nSteve Easterbrook: Sure. So, first of all, one important context to put within my comments about it being a positive global comparable sales quarter even without the impact and the bounce back from the supplier issue in APMEA, we will be projecting a positive quarter. So, there is strength in the underlying like-for-like sales growth independent of that. Now, that bounce back further supports it. We are seeing it more across the international lead markets, which isn\u2019t just Europe. We are seeing that connected group of France, Germany, UK, Canada and Australia, are gathering momentum as a collective group, which is great. The U.S., what we are working hard to do is minimize \u2013 and currently, the U.S. is a little bit of a drag. We are looking just to narrow that gap and return that business to growth, but we are not putting in anything significant for growth at all in the third quarter, but we are working hard towards getting it by the end of the year.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. And am I still with you?\nChris Stent: Yes.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes.\nBrian Bittner: Just to follow-up on that, obviously, value, service and menu are the headline drivers for the U.S. going forward and obviously a lot of moving pieces underneath that hood, but I just want to ask on the value piece. What is \u2013 you talked about a longer term national value platform that you are thinking about, what are you thinking about in terms of that? Any color you can put on that? And maybe when we could really see it be implemented?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, that\u2019s right. And as you know, the owner/operators and the management team came together and recognized the need for a national value offer across this summer. I think that\u2019s further emphasized and cemented on their minds, but the idea of national value going forward is a positive thing. The $2.50 deal is not the answer, but they are certainly being helpful in this immediate term. And therefore the owner/operator group have already tasked themselves actually to come out with something they feel would be strong right across the country to benefit everyone\u2019s business, whether it\u2019s the Northeast or the Southwest and we\u2019ll share more news when it comes, but it won\u2019t be in the immediate term, but it will fill an important role for us certainly as we look through 2016.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.\nKaren Short: Hi. I guess just following on that question. I mean, obviously, we know you rolled out the $2.50 value meal in mid-June and obviously the simplified drive-through menu was fully implemented by early July. So, I guess I am wondering they obviously wouldn\u2019t have any impact on the second quarter results, but any color you can give on how both of them are benefiting July or maybe just talk a little bit about the success or what your thoughts are?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Well, certainly both of those decisions that have been taken have helped our business. It took us a little bit of time to execute the $2.50 as well as we wanted, because having rolled that out, it begun to conflict a little bit with a lot of energy in the regions, because the regions were taking upon themselves to drive value on a local level. So, we spend a little bit of time for first two or three weeks just tidying that up, getting our execution better in the restaurants and our marketing execution support for it, and we expect a greater contribution through the rest of the summer; for the drive-through menu boards unequivocally positive from a consumer perspective and also for the restaurant \u2013 the team to deliver better service. So, again, neither of them are going to be seismic changes to the trajectory of our business. They are both positive moves and we are working hard in executing them both and they will certainly both contribute to rebuilding some momentum through quarter three.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen & Company.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. The Australian turnaround was a few steps ahead of the U.S. with a similar playbook between the two markets. Can you help us size up the difference between the two starting points, with the sales weakness in Australia as prolonged and as extreme that the U.S. currently is? And then I have a follow-up on that as well.\nSteve Easterbrook: I would say, by and large, it wasn\u2019t far off yet. What we have seen in turnarounds in all of our markets, whenever we face a turnaround situation, we\u2019ve slightly taken our eye off the ball. The competition has moved little quicker than we have. We have lost the value foothold that\u2019s so important to our business and we haven\u2019t created compelling energetic plans with our operators in a way that we like to do when we have gone full throttle. So, the similarities heading into the turnaround were somewhat similar. What I would call out Australia for, and incredible credit to the team and the owner/operators there, is the pace with which they\u2019ve moved once they have galvanized themselves to get around big initiatives. They have gone for a small number of big moves and they have gone quickly and they have gone together and that\u2019s created visible change in the restaurants, visible benefits to consumers and the traction is very, very encouraging. And by the way, with the new structure we have, with effectively six global major markets, our ability to transfer that knowledge from market to market is that much quicker. So, I know Mike Andres and the team and the owner/operators in the U.S. are very familiar with the Australia story, with the UK turnaround story, with what the German team have been doing and they [indiscernible] and adapted to local market.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley: Thank you. I have two questions in different directions. First, Steve or Kevin, as you are reviewing the next phase of the financial moves that you have made and plan to update us at the November meeting, does the real estate factor into that? Is that part of that analysis and part of what you might address one way or the other in November?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Joe, it\u2019s Kevin. We are looking at everything, I would say, kind of the three components I\u2019ve talked about, the ownership strategy, [indiscernible] optimization and cost structures. We are kind of going through deeper analyses of each of those and so you should expect to hear an update on all those components in November.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.\nKeith Siegner: Thanks. Steve, you talked about again value service in menu and when you talked about menu, you mentioned all-day breakfast and the tests that are continuing there. But when we look across the landscape of QSRs, there is a lot of new product news, really buzzy interesting stuff, not always operationally complex, but just good new product news. And that really wasn\u2019t a part of the conversation today when you are going through the menu piece. How do we think about new product innovation at the regionalized level? Can you give us an update on that, please? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, it\u2019s a really good question, Keith. The only thing I am most excited about with regards to the, if you like, the new menu news is the fact that the energy is going into revitalizing our core menu and that should not be lost. I mean, when we sit here and assess how can you make the biggest difference to the most customers in the shortest space of time improving our core menu and our delivery of the core menu is clearly the way to go. So, I don\u2019t want to lose sight of the fact that toasting of buns, better searing of beef, taking care of the dressings and the packaging and the rest of it, that gets noticed by customers. With regards to, if you like, new product development, I would say, at a national level, we will be looking at, if you like quality over quantity. It\u2019s not about having lots of national LTOs, because that does complicate the business. It gets confusing to message right. So, we would be looking at fewer higher impact items going out and our team with Chef Dan and his team are working hard on that. And then you will also see the localized options. I called out lobster roll in Boston, for example, that could be much more nimble shorter-term relevant to the local consumer demographic in taste and flavors. And I think you will see there two levels. There will be not a frenzied activity. It will be a calm, measured and higher impact with fewer items national and then locally there will be some energy on a local basis. But don\u2019t miss out \u2013 honestly, don\u2019t miss out the benefit of continually improving our core menu as well.\nChris Stent: Next question from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I was just wondering if you could dig into reasons, examples why you are excited about international lead markets accelerating into the second half. Are there specific examples of countries that are picking up momentum or platform innovation that you are excited about, like for instance I think you were talking about Australia being one of the early ones to go out create your taste, but more texture the better as far as what you are seeing in these markets? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, I think it\u2019s a great question. As you look at the five lead markets, first of all, really strong local management teams and strong alignment of the operators is a consistency across all five. That is a fantastic foundation, but there were peculiarities and merits amongst each and every one of them. If you go to France, the advancements they have made with technology, for example, on how they have totally reappraised the customer journey is fantastic to see. So, let me be specific. They now have self order chaos in all of their restaurants. They are taking upward of 40% of the transactions through the busy hours through the self order kiosks. And the reason that\u2019s exciting is probably three reasons I guess. One, for the first time, we give customers a choice and they just welcome choice. Two, it takes on the stress away from the front counter and therefore you divide some of the pressure, some of the load during the busiest times. And three, from a commercial perspective, we see higher average checks because customers spend little time ordering. They can browse the menu for a little bit longer, feel a little less pressure and they just tend to spend more. So we are getting a lot of learns from that. If you go to Germany, for example, which is earlier stages of a turnaround, the brand has got its mojo back. And when you do that, you start to attract attention for the right reasons. The new agreement we have just reached development license agreement with Tank & Rast is a fantastic agreement for us, because if anyone knows the travel infrastructure, transport infrastructure in Germany, you will know that autobahns play a huge role. That\u2019s helping people typically get from city to city. And therefore, to have roadside presence in up to 100 sites effectively to no capital from our perspective that\u2019s what happens when a brand in a market gets its mojo back. You start to attract this sort of partners we want to be doing business with. Australia, are progressing \u2013 basically they have become our lead market in what we call Create Your Taste. Now all of our markets are building out the broader umbrella, which is a good experience in the future. Many components to that, there is technology, there is visual menu boards, there is new service procedures, there are self-order kiosks and customizable personalization of food. The Create Your Taste group that the Australian team have gone down, they rolled out market wide in a little over six months or seven months to a level where they can now nationally advertise it. We are going to learn a lot of how that works, it\u2019s an in-store solution currently, can we drive traffic in-store, can we increase dwell time, can we \u2013 is the table service that goes along with that matter to customers and our ability and our visibility for market to market on each of these initiatives. I believe that\u2019s when McDonald\u2019s is at its best when we have test sales actively pushing the boundaries. And when something works we can then transport it from market to market at pace. And again I don\u2019t want to minimize the number of things the U.S. team are working on. I mean the U.S. is our lead market for the mobile app. Now, we have recognized we are a little behind some others where there is enough second seller in broader retail, but let me put on line two things. We are one of the best execution companies in the world. The U.S. will start with an app with fairly modest capabilities, but the infrastructure is built, so we can add to it and transfer it from market to market at pace. So that is where I guess my energy and my confidence comes from is that kind of connective momentum and you start to spur each other on.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Question is a little bit more on a modeling question with respect to an update on your outlook for refranchising and selling the company-owned stores. I was wondering what are the early indications or site lines that you might have with respect to what type of EBITDA impact it might have? As we look out sort of 2 years from now, how much EBITDA are you basically taking off of your bookstore? Is it pretty much a good substitute where we suspect that the storage you are selling could garner a similar rent in royalty structure than the existing 82% of your worldwide base of franchisees?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, hey, Matt. Let me talk real quickly about the refranchising. As you know, there is a lot of kind of different things that go into that. So, the strategy and timing will probably vary across our different segments and even within markets. Some markets will be completely franchised or converted to a developmental license, while others will just have more conventional franchising. So, it\u2019s difficult to estimate exact timing or exact financial implications of each of those. As you can imagine, these are long-term decisions that we are making generally for at least 20 years or so with right licensees and operators. So, it\u2019s important we get this right and we will see G&A and capital as we do this. We will certainly get a little bit more stable revenue stream. On an EBITDA basis, it would be difficult to generalize on what that means in total for the company, because it\u2019s going to be pretty lumpy over the next couple of years as we have specific transactions getting there.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Steve, I have a question about the U.S. business and the overall strategy there. I think one of the key pillars of your turnaround strategy was to get more focused and reduce some of the complexity and improve business at the core. And I think you are going to reference that earlier in the call here. But at the same time, we are seeing messages about all-day breakfast and things that sound fairly complex. So, could you help reconcile that with the overall strategy? It seems like there is complexity being added in some places when you are thinking about reducing complexity in others.\nSteve Easterbrook: No, it\u2019s a perfect question, David. And I\u2019d love to address that. So, as we explore different initiatives to drive the business, clearly, all-day breakfast is one of those. So, initially, the owner/operator group, they took a fairly pioneering approach out in San Diego and actually I was fortunate I went down to visit them just two or three weeks ago and spent time with the operator in their restaurants understanding what it really meant. So, we are trying to prove out and proving out the consumer business base, consumer demand for all-day breakfast. But to your point, you can\u2019t talk simplification and add to the meantime. What we work on is, are there multiple ways to reduce complexity and streamline the job for our personal managers, enable them to be able to accommodate this. So, what we want to do \u2013 and people say why can\u2019t you move faster with all-day breakfast, for example? There were a number of moving parts to this. So, what we are going to need to do is, a) prove out that the consumer-facing business case, but also come up with how a low tracking work, such as the net impact is net simplification. Adding one thing and taking one thing off is not simplification. So, what we want to do is simplify the operation in sufficient other ways, but even if we were to go with an all-day breakfast that the net impact on the restaurants is one of simplification. So, let me give you some ideas around that and what that really means. Some of that is around simplifying the menu, go deeper into some of the rationalization [indiscernible] things off. There is way other ways of doing it than just the menu, operational procedures. We have a team with operators and some of our exposed in our national operations team here in the U.S. looking at other procedures that we can simplify in the restaurant whether it\u2019s the way we assemble menu items when we work, whether it\u2019s the way we have the packaging laid out, whether it\u2019s the way we use technology to be able to get orders to the back of the kitchen just to take out steps and workloads, but we also have ideas just around entire process of how do we reduce the amount of noise, when intended noise that goes into a restaurant that managers have to deal with on service and facing the customers. So, when you put all those work streams together and if we were to build a compelling business case, if we were to believe all-day breakfast is sufficient sales driver that is worth making other complementary changes on simplification. The net-net has to be simplification and it will only be up on that basis that we would be moving forward.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Kevin, I am just trying to understand this, imagine the scenario as you would cause you to reevaluate the dividend policy in some way, either there maybe a negative scenario under which you would look at the payout ratio and say it\u2019s getting too high and you need to bring that back into line or perhaps just like a positive scenario where you are thinking about the different cash flows to support that dividend that maybe dividing those up on different entities. Can you at least provide us some direction in what way you are thinking about it? Is it a positive event, a negative event? Because I think it\u2019s so important and critical to the investor base of your stock.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, John. As we think about all these financial areas, so the refranchising, looking at G&A, the ownership structures and kind of our whole strategic planning process that includes capital and how much capital we will be spending in the future etcetera, all of these things become pretty interconnected as you can imagine. So, our thought was we need to examine the right view on all of these things together and talk about them in total as kind of the whole picture. And so we will have that whole picture for everyone in November as we go through our strategic planning process, get a better view into capital and have a better view on all these other financial areas also.\nSteve Easterbrook: But I will just to add to that, John, as well. When we were a little bit of a pivot point in the global, where we believe we were seeing some early stages of momentum. And if we were just to have an extra couple of months of trading under our belts as well that would also just give us another variable to put inside the equation as well. So, it\u2019s important of us. We are paying very acute attention to our trading performance momentum market by market, particularly those major markets. And again, they all contribute to the underlying assumptions that help us make the right decisions for the business and for the shareholders.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse: Hi, thank you for taking the question. If you look at regions that have seen called earlier signs of momentum and are now momentum that you are building on whether it\u2019s UK, Australia, when you look at consumer metrics that were leading indicators of that, what were the ones that were most closely tied to the sales accelerating? And where do you see those metrics in the U.S. today?\nSteve Easterbrook: I hope I am answering your question the right way, Karen. What we have done since the structure has been implemented is really identify rather than trying to have generic U.S. wide consumer metrics is to few of the regions with that type of information and insight for them to make sharper decision. So, in some areas, there was a stronger economic recovery than others. In others, the competition is different. And in terms of the dynamics and demographics are different. So, what we have been doing and the markets where we are seeing the greater success are those that are using those consumer insights and responding quickest to the needs of consumers and what else is happening in the marketplace. And typically, they have taken one or two bolder moves. They have put themselves out there and they have decided to take a bit of a charge and take some risks and show the way. And then we will be transferring some of those learns from region to region over time. I would say probably some of the characteristics of the leading regions at the moment are those who are using whether it\u2019s disposable income metrics, unemployment metrics, value for money metrics, their assessment of our day-to-day operations and are responding to those and are building plans to address the things that matter most to customers.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the labor investment, if you will, that you are making in the U.S. I think that\u2019s something we have heard from a lot of companies. Certainly, it seems like the competition for labor has stepped up a little in addition to some of the regulatory changes, whether it\u2019s $15 minimum wage in some municipalities or over time requirements that go into effect. I guess, first I wanted to get a sense of whether what you are doing now is meant to preempt some of these actual legal regulations. And also, what is the implication for your franchisees, which is a second part of that is broader, how are the franchisees profitability, economics and your relationship with them, so if you can just talk about labor costs in the outlook and then also maybe give us an update on franchisee economics and where they stand with respect to some of the initiatives that you are taking on that side?\nKevin Ozan: Okay. So I will talk, let me begin and I will talk about some of the labor challenges and economics. And then I will let Steve just talk about kind of labor or franchisee relations in general. As you talk about Sarah, there are certainly labor pressures around the world from a wage standpoint. I don\u2019t know that we think of it as kind of an undue pressure anything that\u2019s going to harm our business. But certainly, labor costs on a pressure right now. In several states, as you know minimum wage has increased. For us, margin is essentially our top line gain. So we need to grow sales. Certainly, we need to grow comp sales in order to grow our margins. And the specific labor moves that we have taken are what we believe we should be doing as a business to make sure that we attract, recruit and retain the best employees we can for our business. And so we are doing that as long as in our mind as long as the playing field is level across industry, we believe we can compete competitively in the long run. And so our hope is that any of the regulations or a law comes through deal with all of the industries similarly. And then we will all have to deal with the same concerns.\nSteve Easterbrook: With regards to the franchisees, I mean understandably they are concerned, I mean as independent business men and women. They are facing cost headwinds anyway, which is just the nature of doing business in an inflationary environment, but when there is way above inflation for instance on wages, then that fairly concerns them. I mean that certainly impacts their confidence and winning this to invest over the long-term if there is that sort of degree of uncertainty. That said and done, over our 60-year history, we had surges in costs before. We tend to go back and realize that all what we have to do is it\u2019s a top line gain. So we face them to the reality. We play the [indiscernible] the franchisees who work with management and it just will force us to drive tougher plans, harder plans, more meaningful plans and drive the top line and get that carried down to help mitigate what are some above inflation headwinds for us. But they are certainly anxious about it, totally understandably it\u2019s an open conversation that we have with them, and we just use that concern to drive \u2013 fuel some energy around growing compelling plans and just turning into a positive for us.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Actually just following on the U.S. focus, I have just a two part question. One, I am just hoping you could \u2013 maybe rank order in the U.S., the categories or dayparts or products in terms of what you think is the greatest driver of the recent U.S. market share loss. It would seem like that\u2019s the goal here we are doing more of your regional attack versus more national. I am wondering if you could prioritize where you are seeing your greatest weakness versus perhaps the most resilient. And then the other part was just could you just clarify \u2013 follow-up that earlier question in terms of the franchisees, just wondering whether it seems like we are hearing more about more challenging relationship, I am just wondering whether there is any actions being considered to help support the franchisees during the difficult period, whatever that might mean or whatever form that might take?\nSteve Easterbrook: Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. So in terms of last daypart, if you look at our product mix and where we have seen a loss in the competitive gap open up is we have lost of the value end of our menu. So breakfast remains very resilient. So it\u2019s really through the daytime daypart where we have seen that gap open up over the last probably 12 to 18 to 24 months. Really as we moved away from Dollar Menu, we can replace it with upwards of an equivalent former value and customers are bothered with that fee. The teams have recognized that and that\u2019s why we put the summer value driver in place, and are working on a longer-term ongoing platform. In terms of relations, the owner/operator is an incredibly resilient group and they are fantastic to work with. We have very open conversations with them. I know Mike Andres and his leadership team in the U.S. and the owner operator leadership team is spending more time together than ever, which is what you do to as you start to rebuild the business plans and drive some growth. One thing that\u2019s \u2013 and I have had the opportunity and the fortune to spend some time with them as well. One thing that I have absolutely wanted to make sure is really clear an evidence of that is we will be willing to support the owner operators as they and the U.S. management team build compelling growth plans. Now, this isn\u2019t about underpinning cost implications. This is if you would grow and invest in your businesses, we will do what we have always done. We will co-invest with them for growth and that remains as true, if not more true today than ever has done. And as they do those plans out and they finalize, a lot of these tests of inflation environment, I look forward to kind of investing with them. It will be a great opportunity for us and it would demonstrate our support to them. And that gives the owner operators a huge amount of confidence. But we are here shoulder to shoulder with them and they are recognizing that. We are building some exciting plans.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.\nJason West: Yes, thanks. Just I guess following up on that thought, Steve. Just can you talk about as you are trying to turn around the U.S. business and comparing it to some of the successes we are starting to see in other markets, do you feel like this system needs some capital investments in the stores, whether it\u2019s equipment or menu board or things like that to really to get this turnaround moving or do you think we can do it without significant capital investments?\nSteve Easterbrook: The initiatives we are working on and Mike and the owner operators who work on environment are ones where I would say there is relatively modest investment need. It\u2019s not the same as rebuilding restaurants or dramatic refurbishments. I mean there are some of our restaurants that do look tide and independently one by one, the owner operators will make that decision for themselves. And we will support them on an individual basis. If we are looking at system wide initiatives, we have recognized it\u2019s an affordable investment level. It may involve some technology investments. It may involve some minor part equipment investments and those are sorts of things we will be co-investing with them, because a lot of investments have already been made in the restaurant. They have invested well and we believe the growth initiatives in this short to medium-term are certainly not going to be of the order of one or two initiatives in the past.\nChris Stent: We have time for one more question from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: The question is on the U.S. once again. Just thinking about the drive-through menu redesign, where I think a third of the menu items came off, why not go further and really highlight that 20% or whatever it is on the menu that has the most turn to presumably increase throughput. And I asked this and kind of a broader question is do you think the U.S. is in a position from a brand perspective or a customer perspective where the in-store brand experience and the drive-through brand experience can actually be split up. And clearly, I am asking a leading question regarding the potential success of Create Your Taste in the United States as presumably you are seeing some signs of in Australia?\nSteve Easterbrook: So, can we go further on the drive-through menu board in terms of price, I think the answer is yes. And as we are exploring other platforms of growth new items introduced, I think you will see us go a little bit deeper in terms of menu rationalization. Whether that\u2019s just taking off the menu board and the merchandising or actually taken out off the menu entirety, I think you will see a bit of both actually. So I think there is further to go, and now team are looking at that as we speak. In terms of the drive-through versus in-store, I think the important piece is less Create Your Taste element and having that type in-store is more where you place technology to offer a better experience to the customer. So if you are going to introduce self order kiosks, clearly that\u2019s going to create a very good environment in store. You don\u2019t really have a cell phone or kiosk for drive-through, but you may get order ahead. You may got to use the app and some of the technology that we can introduce to that, but they would order ahead, get geo-location, get recognized in the drive-through lane, rise their order off to the back of the kitchen before they even have to place the order. So, I think technology will be a differentiator to give us different service models, but it will still be a McDonald\u2019s. They will still enjoy the McDonald\u2019s experience, but just in different ways. I think technology is the differentiator rather than a different two-tier strategy.\nChris Stent: We are near the top of the hour, so I will turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.\nSteve Easterbrook: Okay, thank you, Chris and again thanks to everyone for joining us this morning."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-04-22 17:33:04", "content": "Executives: Chris Stent - Vice President, Investor Relations Stephen Easterbrook - President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ozan - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen - Chief Administrative Officer\nAnalysts: Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Andrew Charles - Cowen and Company Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Keith Siegner - UBS Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo John Glass - Morgan Stanley David Palmer - RBC Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein Will Slabaugh - Stephens Jason West - Credit Suisse Andy Barish - Jefferies Matt DiFrisco - Guggenheim John Ivankoe - JPMorgan Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray David Tarantino - Robert W.

Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Easterbrook: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Since stepping into this role maybe two months ago, I've been relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and teams to think differently about what we're doing and how we're doing it, and working with senior leadership to determine the best path forward. As we announced this morning, we have scheduled a separate call on May 4 to share the initial details of our turnaround plan. We appreciate your patience, as we focus today on our first quarter results and the overall approach we are taking as we develop plans to reenergize the business. First quarter performance reinforces our imperative to stabilize and improve our underlying business performance. Let me start by sharing an overview of recent performance across the top nine markets that contribute most of our overall consolidated results, starting with Australia, the U.K. and Canada, which are trending positive. Australia is in the early stages of turning around its business through a multifaceted approach to enhance brand appeal for consumers. This includes meaningful enhancements to our menu, including both core and new menu items across several categories, value platforms and better restaurant operations. The U.K. continues its strong track record of positive performance with first quarter comparable sales representing the market's 36 consecutive quarter of growth. These results reflect the market's diligent execution of its customer-centric plans that span multiple initiatives, including food choice and food quality, marketing and promotions and enhancements to the service experience, such as expanding drive-through capacity during peak periods and building the overnight experience. In addition, in Canada, strong promotional performance and new menu news drove average check and positive comparable sales performance for the quarter. Next, are Germany and China, two markets that have shown recent signs of improvement. In Germany, negative comparable sales trends have moderated in the last two quarters. The market has strengthened its value platform, and at the same time promoted premium products and add-on purchases to their average check. We expect recovery in this market to remain uneven, however, as reflected in March's weak comparable sales performance. China continues to recover from last year's supplier issue. Efforts to regain brand trust are working, and the market remains on track to return to a normalized level of performance by mid-year. And finally, the U.S., France, Russia and Japan, where challenges persist. U.S. results remain disappointing. Recent actions taken by Mike and his leadership team, including implementing a more efficient operating structure, simplifying the menu and holding the U.S. Turnaround Summit with operators in March, are helping to create a renewed sense of energy and focus around better delivery of local customer needs. In both, France and Russia, consumer confidence remains low and challenging macroeconomic conditions continue to negatively impact results. Despite a declining IEO industry, France continues to maintain market share with efforts to strengthen the value platform and enhance the customer service experience on differentiating the brand in the market. Amidst the external pressures in Russia, the team remains focused on driving sales through strong product and promotional offers, growing the breakfast business and initiatives that focus on rebuilding brand trust with consumers in the market. Japan's recovery from the supply issue has not been as strong as China, and subsequent consumer perception issues have further depressed sales and profitability. As evidenced by last week's announcement of the business revitalization plan, the Japanese and APMEA teams are intensely focused on addressing the significant challenges in this market, though we expect results will continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future. And Kevin will provide more details around our first quarter results in a moment. Let me shift gears now and discuss the approach I am taking to lead McDonald's into the future. My operating principles, if you will. First is a greater emphasis on personal accountability. I am honest and fair if I don't dispense forced kindness. Where we need to fix the fundamentals, we need to act now; and where we need to make an impact, I'm not looking for incremental steps. We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand and our food. I hold people accountable for tangible actions and outputs, and I can assure you that I hold myself accountable to these same high standards. My second operating principle is grounded in the customer. As a retail business we must be even more customer-centric. This means deeper understanding, better listening, better segmentation, genuine sharp insights regarding what our customers want and need and when they want it, as determined from the smart use of data and analytics. We need to be the best at knowing what matters most to consumers, and we will focus our best talent and prioritize spending, where it will optimally support our turnaround. My third philosophy is progress over perfection. We will try new things, move fast with what works and even faster from what doesn't. And when we find winning plays, we'll be more nimble, much like we did with the rollout of Apple Pay this last fall, from first contact to going live to 12 weeks. We can make meaningful changes for customers in weeks. We just have to do it more often. My final approach to leading is I champion simplicity. We are simplifying for greater transparency, accountability and speed. We are making the business more responsive to market conditions, while using our scale advantage more effectively. We cannot afford to carry legacy attitudes and legacy thinking, and we won't. My overall vision is for McDonald's to be seen as a modern, progressive burger company, delivering a contemporary customer experience. Modern is about getting the brand to where we need to be today, and progressive is about doing what it takes to be the McDonald's, our customers will expect tomorrow. We are already moving more assertively in this direction, with actions that delight our customers and energize our brand. For example, we recently committed to enhance the benefits to employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., including a wage increase and paid time off for full and part-time for employees. In March, we announced in the U.S. that we will stop using antibiotics that are important to human medicines, and are checking supply chain within the next two years. And there are plans to feature 100% sirloin burgers for a limited time in the U.S., along with a current test on all-day breakfast. We also undertook a significant effort to excite our customers and bring the world together virtually with I'm Lovin It 24. About 70,000 people participated in the event, which included 24 hours of McDonald's inspired disruptive creativity in major cities around the world. And it garnered more than 2 billion impressions across public relations stories and social media interactions. Last month, the German team opened a new 500-seat flagship restaurant in Frankfurt, showcasing our most modern digital and service amenities. And just yesterday, we announced our global commitment on deforestation, which confirms our aspiration to end deforestation throughout our supply chain. We are harvesting the power inherent in the McDonald's brand and in our network of valued franchisees, employees and supplier partners to make this great brand even greater. One of the advantages of my broad experience within McDonald's and running other restaurant chains is seeing other cultures, different structures, different models. Through this experience, I see McDonald's and its fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that is helping me look objectively in the business and make decision to position McDonald's to deliver enduring, profitable growth for shareholders and the system. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. We begin 2015 taking action, to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround, as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business. Today I'd like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results, including the strategic charges taken in the quarter. Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential. Our financial model, and therefore my remarks, start with topline sales. First quarter comparable sales were down 2.3%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments. APMEA's first quarter comp sales decline of 8.3% had the largest impact on our global performance, with Japan and China posting declines of 32.3% and 4.8%, respectively. While these results are partly due to the lingering impact of the APMEA supplier issue, Japan's performance reflects the broad-based consumer perception challenges that the market is working to overcome. Japan accounts for the lion's share of this segment's quarterly comparable sales decline. Sales trends in China continue to show sequential improvement, as we moved through the quarter. And Australia remains a bright spot, posting its third consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. In the U.S., comparable sales were down 2.6% for the quarter, as the segment's slightly positive breakfast dayparts was offset by weakness across all other dayparts. We are working to enhance the customer experience with locally relevant taste, a simplified menu and compelling value offerings. Europe comparable sales ended the quarter down 0.6%, with positive performance in the UK more than offset by weak results in France and Russia. Looking ahead to April, global comparable sales are expected to be negative. This weak topline performance accounted for about half of the constant currency decline in operating income for the first quarter. The other half of the decline in operating income is attributable to the $195 million of strategic charges taken in the quarter to optimize the business. The first component of the charges, totaling $85 million, includes asset write-offs related to our refranchising initiative, as we made decisions to sell certain restaurants to developmental licensees. The next component of these charges is related to the strategic decisions to close about 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, the U.S. and China. These restaurant closings are in addition to the 350 global restaurant closings originally planned for 2015. The total charge for asset write-offs related to these incremental closings was approximately $72 million. Most of these restaurants were not contributing to our overall profitability or cash flow, and we will continue to review our restaurant portfolio with the intent of optimizing our asset base around the world. The final component of the charges was $38 million related to restructuring costs for our U.S. business. This amount consist primarily of employee severance and other related costs. Earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.37, which include $0.17 related to the strategic charges and $0.09 in negative foreign currency impact. Excluding the impact of the charges and foreign currency translation, earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.11 or 9%. From an operating perspective, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which declined $152 million to $1.6 billion, a 1% decrease in constant currencies. Global company-operated margin dollars declined $164 million to $560 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease in constant currencies. The company-operated margin percent decreased 180 basis points to 14.3%, reflecting negative comparable guest counts across all segments as well as higher commodity and labor costs. Next, I want to provide an update on our commodities, pricing, foreign currency impact and cash returned to shareholders. I'll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe. For the first quarter, U.S. commodity cost rose approximately 2%, primarily due to higher beef prices. To help offset this pressure, we took some price increases. Our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 2%, which was below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year is 2% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity cost were relatively flat in the first quarter. Our pricing increases in Europe, varied by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year. Now, turning to foreign currency impact. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. During the last eight months, the dollar has experienced its fastest rise in 40 years. At these levels, foreign currency translation is having a significant impact on our reported results, as evidenced by the $700 million impact to our first quarter reported revenues and the $0.09 impact to our first quarter reported EPS. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.13 to $0.14 in the second quarter and $0.40 to $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change, as we move throughout the year. And keep in mind, this is an accounting translation impact more than a cash impact. Despite our topline and margin pressures, our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In addition to reinvesting in the business to drive future growth, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. As Steve mentioned, we're taking a close look at our organization, challenging ourselves and the status quo. Our goal is to position the company for enduring profitable growth. We must get back to better leveraging the benefits of our business model, including the entrepreneurial spirit of our franchisees. We must utilize our considerable resources more efficiently, and we must meet our customers' evolving needs more consistently. I am energized by the challenges before us, and I look forward to working with Steve, Pete and the broader McDonald's system to bring our vision to reality. Thank you. Now, I'll turn it back to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nChris Stent: Thanks, Kevin. Before we begin Q&A, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter we provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing annual earnings per share. In light of the upcoming announcement of McDonald's turnaround plan, it was not appropriate to update our outlook in management's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on our outlook will be provided in conjunction with the announcement of our plans on May 4, 2015.\nA - Chris Stent: We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: A question on the U.S. business. In the U.S., I've heard a lot over the last few months about the need for more simplicity, needing to improve speed, which I think suggests a diagnosis of a throughput problem. But when you look at the underperformance in the comps versus the industry and on an absolute basis, it does suggest a bigger, more pure demand issue. And so the question is, what's going to be going on over the next couple months to really drive a resurgence in guest counts that maybe more dramatic than simplification? I guess like, are the extended breakfast tests going well? What's the plan there? As far as new products being rolled out more rapidly, like you guys just did the chicken sandwich, is that something we're going to see more of? If you could just kind of talk about that altogether, that will be great.\nStephen Easterbrook: You're absolutely right. There is no one single solution to getting any of our businesses moving. We have strong plans in place. And I guess if I can dissect that question of yours; one is, how we're going to drive demand? And then secondly, how we're going to manage that demand? The driving demand is going to be driven through both national and local menu news. So we have some strong and some exciting product pipelines ahead. So most recently we've announced the sirloin burger, which we believe will be a favorite with customers and have broad resonance. But also we are liberating the creativity, and I guess the insights of our local markets to develop local food menu items that better resonate with the local customer base. So the demand driving, I believe, can operate at two levels. That said and done, we've still got to make the entire McDonald's experience just a little easier for our customers and a little easier for our crew, and that's where the simplification piece comes in. And it's not simply the menu simplification, it's what else can we take off the workload of our teams in the restaurants to enable them to focus on what really matters, which is taking care of customers. So menu simplification will certainly help. There has been the initial phase of that from January, where we have not seen a significant sales uplift from it, but we have seen it provide us with easing of operational complexity. There will be further moves on menu simplification coming up now, because we have a number of tests in place, and we can share those with you as the results become clearer. But also there is other things we can do to take workload out of the restaurant and just simplify the job of our managers and crews, so they can focus on their frontline role, which is taking care of customers. So two things, driving demand and then meeting demand, and we've got actions on both.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen and Company.\nAndrew Charles: Kevin, to put the U.S. and China restaurant closures in perspective, what's the base of company restaurants that are currently cash flow negative? And should we expect these closures to be the first wave and what could be future closures as well?\nKevin Ozan: The restaurants that we closed, that we're announcing that we're closing right now, were all certainly underperforming, not adding significantly to profitability and cash flow. We don't expect a lot more throughout the rest of this year. So you shouldn't expect to see a lot more happen through the rest of the year related to additional closures. There may be some little charges that, I'll say, come in through the next couple of quarters, some related to incurring costs as we actually close the restaurants, and there may be a few additional restaurants. But you shouldn't expect a lot more significant closings, certainly nothing to the magnitude of the first quarter.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley: Maybe a couple of follow-ups on that, and if you guys defer this to May 4, I understand, but there was no mention of expansion in 2015. Are the old expansion plans kind of still in place, so net-net there would still be some increase in restaurants? And then, somewhat related question, I guess. The $85 million charge from the prior or already previously disclosed refranchising plans, is that coming because you decided to do those on a developmental licensing basis? And if so, maybe talk about that change, in thought of if in fact it was a change.\nKevin Ozan: First, related to expansion. You saw we took everything out from the outlook. Obviously, we're still opening restaurants, but we'll update all the kind of outlook pieces, including expansion, on the call on May 4. Related to the charges, a couple things. So we referred to one of the pieces of the charge as cost related to write-offs, as we made decisions to sell restaurants to developmental licensees. That'd be consistent with our past practice, as we make decisions to sell, whether its restaurants or countries to somebody. We need to look and see how it's valued and what we believe we can get in return for selling those restaurants. And as we make a decision and evaluate kind of the fair value versus what we have recorded on our books, it requires us to potentially write down the net book value to get to the cost of the selling price we're going to realize. That's what those amounts relate to. It will be consistent with prior practice. We made some decisions to actually sell some restaurants to developmental licensees, and we need to now record the cost of it. It equals what we expect to realize when we sell those restaurants.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Steve, just a question on franchise relations or maybe the health of the franchisees, however you want to look at it. But it's obviously difficult for us looking in from the outside. On one hand, it would seem like your franchisees are probably among the most successful in quick service, whether it's from sales or a profit standpoint. But at the same time, I can't imagine the recent weakness doesn't drive some frustration. So I'm just wondering, with that kind of as background backdrop, I mean, what's the greatest pushback or perhaps just maybe suggestions you hear from franchisees in terms of turning around at least the U.S. business? That would be one thing, because I'm guessing they have some pretty good insights. And secondly, do you typically discuss the initiatives and plans for the system with them ahead of time? For example, like the turnaround presentation in early May, do they get kind of advanced look or do they opine on the initiatives that you plan on putting out there?\nSteven Easterbrook: So the overall brand relationship is absolutely fundamental to the ongoing strength. It has been for 60 years, and certainly I want to continue that and champion that. When business is a little tougher, like it is at the moment in the U.S., with cash flows being challenged, yes, frustrations do arise, as you would expect. The wonderful thing about the relationship we have with the operators is that there's a really open dialogue. Their views and our views, we share openly, as we build these plans together. And I don't think that will change. As you go through turnarounds, I'm going to tell you from my experience in the past in other markets, they are a little bumpy by nature. It isn't just a straight line growth curve. And it does require some bold and decisive decision-making, which on occasions could lead to one or two friction points. And there's one or two things we can learn from one or two decisions we've made, but it doesn't mean the decisions we are making are wrong, far from it. I am confident in the decisions that Mike's making for the U.S. and I am making at a global level. And the ultimate objective from this clearly is, as you know, with our business model, of the three-legged stool, is that our supply partners, our owner/operators in the company succeed together. And I would love that to be an operator-led success as well. Nothing would thrill me more. With regards to what we are looking towards on May 4, we have a number of measures we'll talk to, some of which clearly you won't expect me to talk to now. Some of which will be, we're going to share some broader operating plans at the markets with a broader audience. So some of the work is going on in the markets, as we speak; there will be other elements that we will save for May 4 to share with all audiences at the same time.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.\nKeith Siegner: Steve, if I could circle back to some of your original points earlier about driving demand and ways to driving demand, you talked about the product. But another increasingly important area is the digital engagement tool. Just wondering if you could give us an update on the launch of a mobile app, maybe some of the details of what functionality you might include in the launch? And then is there going to be this roll of subsequent updates and increased functionality? How do we think about adding in this tool to the driving demand aspect to the equation?\nSteve Easterbrook: It is a great question, Keith. It's something we are excited about here, I have got to say. As you probably know in my previous role I was responsible for trying to establish our digital team and division here, and that we've built a highly skilled and capable group of managing that for us. We are moving, without a doubt, from a world of mass marketing to one I describe as mass personalization. And clearly, technology allows us to do that now, which allows us to build a much more meaningful relationship with our customers, to shift from a transactional relationship into a far more engaging and meaningful, purposeful relationship where we can understand their needs on individual basis rather than a generic basis. We are building, what we're calling our global mobile app. We will be launching it in the U.S. in the second half of this year. And there are two elements to our digital vision. One is the experience side and the other is the engagement side. The experience is how can we use technology just to make the day-to-day customer experience easier and more convenient. And the engagement side is really more about the fun part of the brand. So the initial app that we'll be launching will be focusing primarily on the experience, just trying to make the day-to-day customer experience smoother and more convenient. And then, future iterations, which are already building up the pipeline, I have got to say, will further enhance that experience and introduce more elements of fun to it. So I would not really be -- personally, we are not building in a sales build in relation to this for 2015, but we do see it as being a business driver as we look out.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer: In past 10-K filings you have disclosed, it looks like that the annual cost to support a typical company-owned U.S. restaurant was about $50,000. I am curious if that number is still accurate. And just as a quick follow-up, on that May 4 date, I am just curious, how did you come to determine that that was an appropriate date to share the turnaround plan details?\nSteve Easterbrook: Well, I can take the second one. So the date was -- clearly, this is my seventh week now in position alongside Kevin as well. And you can imagine we have been working pretty hard on this. It wasn't a standing start. We both have our histories we brought into our current positions. May 4 is an important opportunity for us, partly because -- so we are moving flat-out to build the meaningful plans that are merit sharing with you. Also, that week we have our leaders from around the world in here as well. And is a great opportunity to share it with them, at the same time we share it with the broader audiences. So that date just sits comfortably in the cadence of action that we're building here.\nKevin Ozan: And then regarding your question on kind of G&A per restaurant, in the U.S., we have said it's about $45,000 per restaurant. Internationally, it varies by market, but it's generally in that $45,000 to $50,000 ballpark.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Steve, to the extent, if you're willing to talk about it today, when you think about your turnaround plan, do you think about them focusing more on the operating part of the business, or is it more of a financial restructuring, or how do you weight those two in importance in your mind? If you're not willing or less willing to talk about that now, I also wonder about how your own turnaround experiences, maybe it's the U.K. or some other business you have been involved with. What are the important elements in those turnarounds? And are those applicable to this situation or is this very different in your mind?\nSteve Easterbrook: Absolutely, unequivocally, this is around driving operating growth in our operating business. Simply put, we want to sell more hamburgers to more customers, more often, around the world. So this is going to be a growth-led turnaround. There are things we can do to help that. And probably to your second point, and just from personal experience, back in the U.K., there were certain things we can do as management and as leaders in this business to help us run a more effective operating business. So the sort of things that I have been looking at is around our organizational structure, around our ownership mix, about how we can get that drive in the restaurants most effectively, and about how we best use our resources. And you may have heard me say before, any leader in any business, there are typically three resources that we have at our disposal. There is human resource; there is financial resource; and there is time. So we're challenging ourselves to how we can most effectively use those three resources to prioritize them behind the areas they're going to deliver the greatest return and the greatest growth in this turnaround.\nChris Stent: Next question David Palmer from RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Steve, just a question on premium and value. On the value side, particularly as you focus on the U.S., how confident are you that regional value marketing is going to be the way, going forward? And how confident are you that this will be effective enough to replace what the Dollar Menu did for McDonald's over a decade? And on the quality side, I know this is a journey which you are embarking upon and you are seeing a little bit in the second quarter, but how good is good enough? For instance, one would have no doubt that if you had a chicken sandwich as good as Chick-fil-A, that that would sell well. But I'm just trying to get a sense of your commitment and how you're benchmarking, and where your goals are on quality.\nSteve Easterbrook: So on the value piece, I would say, regional clearly has a part to play, but they need to balance. And although that Mike and the U.S. team are working on that balance between getting national-driven value where we can use our scale and that economy of scale on a national level, along with freeing up the regions to really identify the menu items that matter most in their geography, given maybe their climates and given affordability issues. It very, very much differs, region by region. So there will be a balance to play on value. We haven't quite found that equation yet. But we have been working hard to unlock it. In terms of quality, our benchmark is ourselves. What we are working on now and what Mike and the menu team is working on is how could we deliver a better McDonald's menu? So we are very proud of our core products. What can we do to enhance the quality, both direct quality, and also the quality perception as we develop new items. Again, our benchmark is ourselves. And our customers are guiding us on that. So we believe if we can bring great quality products at the value of McDonald's that is the equation that will drive growth.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse: So looking at a number of initiatives, whether it's on the improving sort of employee benefits and wages, or improving the quality of products, theoretically there would be a cost associated with most of these. And how do we think about it from a high level versus the plan to absorb those costs versus push that onto the consumer through pricing in the company system? And then as these cost pressures on ingredient side would float to franchises and then wages, there could be some over effects for McDonald's. And then other larger players who are making similar moves, just helping them manage through that without necessarily passing all of it on.\nKevin Ozan: The minimum wage cost, as well as all other costs certainly impact how we look at pricing, how we look at our margins. We have talked about with the minimum wage that it will impact our margins in the near term. But there is a lot of benefits to it, and that it will be able to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace. Our thought is that our turnover will decrease. We'll be able to attract and retain the best employees. So while there's a near-term cost to some of those, we also look at the benefits. And the market will help dictate to us what kind of pricing we're able to get related to some of those costs. But we look at a lot of this as, what do we need to do to make sure that we have got the business set up to be able to drive top line sales. And those are some of the pieces.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just one piece to add to that as well is, I talked about simplicity and simplification. Complexity typically adds costs, in one way, shape, or form as well. So I know Mike and the team are working hard to try and strip either the non-value-added activity out of the restaurants, or make cuts as far away from the consumer as possible, just to free up a little bit of room on the P&L, so we can mitigate one or two of the inherent inflationary costs that we face.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: One little detail, and then I guess a bigger question. The detail is, I may have missed it, but could you give us the China comp? And then the bigger question is, just going back to the store closures, can you give us a sense, were they more likely to come from later cohorts as stores, as in, is there some evidence that maybe the store growth that we've seen over the last couple of years probably may have led to a point of kind of over saturation? I guess, in general, when I look at turnarounds in this industry, they usually do include a fairly significant amount of asset rationalization. So I'm just trying to get a sense of the sort of growth rate going forward that you would expect to see, and how you think about the stores? Maybe some of the more recent development decisions were not ideal?\nKevin Ozan: Regarding China's comp for the quarter, it was negative 4.8%. So that's the China question. The other, regarding kind of optimizing assets, what I would tell you is we've been reviewing our restaurant portfolio around the world to ensure that we're set up to grow successfully in the future. So that review resulted in these decisions to close the 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, U.S., and China. In China, a lot of those openings were, I'll say, between 2009 and 2012, where they have been consistently underperforming. Our sales estimation processes probably weren't as great during those years, but we now have better tools and a better processes so that our sales estimation processes have been better. Japan, they are generally heavy loss-maker restaurants that we're closing, so that will help the portfolio. And we're pretty much complete with that review. Like I said before, there may be some limited additional closures. There may be some limited additional charges. But the magnitude of any additional charges will not be anything close to what we have got in the first quarter.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Will Slabaugh, Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh: Just a question around the menu globally, and maybe even more applicable here in the U.S. Can you talk about the balance of launching new items that are enticing and different enough to actually drive new people, or maybe lapsed guests into your restaurants that's been lacking a little bit in the past number of years versus your plan to simplify the menu?\nSteve Easterbrook: So I think there is probably three elements to this, actually, Will. So one is our core menu, which is still our fundamental engine of growth. These are $1 billion brands. A handful of products are $1 billion brands, right, and are much loved, so we are working hard to reinvigorate the consumers' love and demand for that. On the new items, two elements, some is launching permanent new items, and some is just using LTOs. Again, they both play a different role. You can only absorb so many new permanent items because, then that's -- clearly they demand a permanent place on menu boards. And that does can typically add up additional complexity. LTO can provide some funds. So you're talking four, five, six-week promotional activity around themes a bit. It could be around World Cup soccer. It could be around the Olympics. It could be around the time of year and the seasonal events. That just makes yourself interesting. That rewards existing customers who may want to try something different for little while and then return to their favorites. So that's always a balance, because you're part of what we're working on with our marketing leads, certainly in the major markets, is to understand how that best balance works. If we lurch too far one way and streamline it, we don't have enough new and enticing news out there. If we go the other way, it becomes a little frenetic and customers can't follow, and the restaurants find it hard to execute. But there is not a science to this, but all very important, but primarily, core, meaningful new menu additions, and then introducing some fun on occasion through LTOs, just to spice up the market a little bit.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.\nJason West: Going back to Jeff Farmer's question about the timing of the meeting, I guess, it felt like you guys are going to spend a little bit more time, Steve, since you haven't been there very long to kind of get the plan together, based on some of your comments at the New York meeting. So I guess, can you talk about, is the meeting on May 4 meant to present the comprehensive sort of final plan that you have come up with or is this more sort of a first look at some of the things that you are working on, and that you will build from there? Can you help frame that a bit?\nStephen Easterbrook: Yes. On the call, we will be sharing the initial details of the turnaround plan. Clearly, I don't want to say too much about it, because that's the reason we are having the call on May 4. We have selected that date because we believe those initial plans will be well enough baked out that it will be meaningful news to all the audiences that have an interest in what we're doing at McDonald's.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAndy Barish: Just one I guess quick follow-up, and then a financial question. On the product news, Steve, do you think the brand has in the research you're looking at or doing, do you think the brand has credibility on the premium side? I mean, there have been some efforts, obviously, with most recently reintroducing chicken tenders, in the past on premium burgers and wings that haven't really worked. So I guess, what's the current thinking on that? And then, the financial question for Kevin was, you referenced higher lease costs and the franchise margin decline. Is there something going on with rent escalations, or something above average, I just don't recall seeing that historically in your explanation.\nStephen Easterbrook: For premium quality, I mean I often describe, because it's possibly the most democratic, with a small d brand in the world. And what customers love the world over, and none more so than here in the U.S., is how they can buy into aspirational quality products, but at a McDonald's price. They don't have to pay over the odds for it. And when we were on our game, and we have all elements of our business working well, our service experience, our digital engagement, the cost account quality, and new food news, then all those components really do add value to the customer experience, and their perception, their assessment of us. So yes, there is room for it. We have to be competitive in the marketplace, but we can bring great quality. So for example, removing the antibiotics out of our chicken supply chain across the next two years is a move that customers value, because we can bring to them quality ingredients and quality menu items at the McDonald's affordable prices. And they encourage us to do more of that. And we will continue, particularly here in the U.S., as Mike brings to life the food agenda that he has his part of his vision for the business, we will continue to make moves such as that to bring premium quality food at everyday prices. And again, the sirloin burger is a great example of that. It's a premium beef cut at McDonald's prices, and looking forward to customers' response to that.\nKevin Ozan: And then, Andy, related to the lease costs, to your point, we normally have rent escalation, so it's not necessarily anything new. Some of it is escalation. But more of it really relates to sales. We've talked about before, it's a topline game, so negative comp sales clearly put pressure on our margins. And when we don't have that sales leverage that's significantly impacts margins. So that's really the bigger impact.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: I think what stuck out to me also was a couple of the growth year markets where you're opening a lot of stores also seem to be some of the weaker comp stories this year. I understand it's a long-term plan, some of those openings. But, is that somewhat of a foreshadowing, I guess, for 2016, perhaps the lower comp environment that we're in now? Should it be presumed that we are going to probably see a little bit more pragmatic and slower development in those markets in response, especially from the franchise community more so or the emerging franchise community in China, does that disrupt it at all?\nPeter Bensen: Yes, there is really no correlation between looking at the store growth numbers in the release and the comp sales. We have acknowledged in some of the major markets, we've got some turnaround activity to undertake. And we are undertaking those obviously with the belief and the confidence that there is long-term growth potential in those markets. And restaurant development is not something that we kind of turn on and turn off with a switch, because there is a pipeline involved. There is some permitting to restaurant opening. It's a several month to multi-year process, depending on the country. So you shouldn't be drawing any correlation between those two, and as we'll be able to talk about it in a little more detail on May 4, the efforts around turning the topline in the business are of utmost focus, especially in those markets where comps are weakest.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Just the two part question, if I may. Steve, as you've kind of seen all the research that McDonald's has had, was there maybe one or two big things that consumers were telling you about three to four years ago that you needed to change, and you could have kind of prevented the decline in the sales? And I ask this question really in the context of what were those preventable factors, if you will, and is the organization kind of in a place where it can act on some of that right research? And secondly, if I may, which I guess is a little bit unrelated, there has been at least some illusion that there could be separate expressions of the McDonald's brand through the drive-through and the in-store experience, at least in the U.S. And Create Your Taste is certainly maybe moving in that direction, but if you could give us some light in terms of how some of the drive-through optimization tests are going around the U.S.?\nStephen Easterbrook: So looking back three to four years, rather than anything we missed through consumer insight, I think perhaps the challenge we let ourselves with, we had four or five growth initiatives working together really through the 2000s, so from '03 to about 2010, 2011, we had a number of different growth platforms that worked. And they worked around the world. Different markets sequence them in different orders, but everything from delivering great quality coffee, which then drove breakfast business, going to extended hours, the re-imaging program, for example, just to name three. Perhaps what we didn't foresee and responded as well as we could have done ourselves is to create that future pipeline and growth platforms. Now, sometimes the consumer will guide you there, but sometimes you've got to take that into your own hands. And that was probably perhaps something that, as we look back through our history, we wish we could have done a little better. The one trend I would say, we're working hard to address now is general consumer desires to be part of something big, but to be treated as an individual. And that's where the whole personalization piece comes in. Whether that's the way we engage and communicate with customers, which is, I believe, technology will help us get there, where we'd have a much more personal relationship at a level that customers are happy with. But also on the menu side and that's where the customization of food comes in. And then on to your second point on Create Your Taste, one of the beauties we have here is we have an ability to test these things out and learn. So Create Your Taste, for example, is an option within our broader McDonald's experience in the future ambition. We have a really concerted push on this in Australia, and we will have one or two markets up and running within the U.S. And we will respond, we will be able to see from consumers' response to that pretty quickly how that in-store experience builds out and plays out. And then, again, relating to your second point, how that then works through the drive-through, and time will tell, but we have a number of other ways that we can perhaps customize our menu or personalize our menu, that we're also are working on. So we have test sales going on around the country and around the world, to better learn how we can best meet that consumer need is around personalization. It is powerful. We believe we can deliver against it. And our confidence is when we start to really connect on that level and unlock the benefits of personalization to 69 million customers a day, that will have a significant impact and drive long-term, sustaining growth.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: I just wanted to ask about the early stages of the efforts to drive results to restructuring of the field level operations. I think that's something that was done in the U.S., I don't know, a quarter or two ago. And I believe that was maybe doing it by region or better matching up the corporate with the local consumer preference. Could you just let us know what you're hearing from the field level operations, please?\nStephen Easterbrook: Yes, so Mike made a very deliberate move at the backend of last year to announce a streamlining of the organization structure. I mean over time, the structures can build up. And really, he took a very concerted view of that. Really took out one level, one layer between corporate and then the regions, and these were 22 regions around the U.S. What that has done it is ask for a different role of performance out of our general managers and our operator leaders in the regions, and a different way of engaging and a speed of decision making in the center. So as the teams are embedding with these new accountabilities and new responsibilities, we were in that transition stage. I don't think we've got everything humming perfectly right now, but nor would I expect us to. It's a significant change for the organization. It's absolutely the right one to have made, and has my full support. And we want to shorten the time period to get superb execution of the new roles and responsibilities in that structure.\nChris Stent: The last question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Steve, just a high-level question about your vision. I think you mentioned that you wanted to remove some of the legacy thinking and change the mindset of the organization. I was wondering if maybe you could share some examples of some of the legacy thinking that needs to be changed. And then, maybe secondly, based on the seven weeks or so you've been in the job, maybe talk a little bit about how ready you think the organization or the system is to embrace some of that change in thinking?\nStephen Easterbrook: That's a nice, soft one to end with, David. Thank you. Right. So when I talk about legacy thinking and legacy attitude, I mean we have been phenomenally successful for 60 years. And there's so many good reasons for that. And there is much of that I would not ever wish to change or challenge. It's very precious to us, and will stand as in good stead for the next 60 years. However, there's a certain conservatism and incrementalism that builds into that. And again, as a company, that has not necessarily been a bad thing. But when you do need to make a step change, our organization doesn't naturally go there. It needs to be led there. And in my experience at McDonald's, whenever we've made substantial decisions and substantial changes, we are wonderfully adaptable once that has been spelled out. But we won't naturally take ourselves there as an organization. So with the team around me, we're challenging some of the conventional thinking on multiple fronts, and some of that we'll be able to share you over time. With regards to whether the seven weeks will get people into a state of readiness, I think there's a hunger and an interest in our business to embrace change. So I mean I hear it as I get into the markets, hear it from younger operators, and I think there is a pull and a hunger in the field for what are we going to stand for, where we're heading, and how are we going to get there. And I am not new to most of the McDonald's system. I am new in position. I totally recognize that. And different expectations and accountabilities come with that, but I think my track record and my history in McDonald's is relatively well known around the place. And therefore, I don't come as a complete surprise. So I look forward to sharing more on May 4 and ongoing.\nChris Stent: We're nearing the top of the hour, so I will turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments. End of Q&A\nStephen Easterbrook: Thank you, Chris. Again thank you everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize our commitment to reenergizing the business on moving more quickly and assertively to meet the demands and the needs for our more than 69 million customers every day around the world. I am confident in our ability to make the right move to reset McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company that provides a contemporary experience for our guests. We will keep driving towards this vision as we build the business and brand and deliver long-term value for customers and shareholders. I look forward to sharing the initial details of our turnaround plan with you on May 4. Thanks again to you all. And have a great day."}], "2017": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2016, "date": "2017-01-23 15:41:03", "content": "Executives: Chris Stent - Vice President, Investor Relations Steve Easterbrook - President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ozan - Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: David Palmer - RBC Matt DiFrisco - Guggenheim Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer David Tarantino - Robert W.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, including reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Additionally, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2017. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing annual earnings per share. In light of our March 1, 2017 investor meeting, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy, it was not appropriate to update our outlook in today\u2019s 8-K filing or on today\u2019s call. An update on our outlook will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in March. And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I am energized by the position we are in today as a result of the progress we have made the past 2 years. When we launched our turnaround plan in 2015, we said we first need to get the foundation right. We focused on running great restaurants and pushed harder on the basics, including hot fresh food, convenience and value. We will spend today talking about the foundation we showed up last year and upon which we will build as we transition from the revitalization phase of our turnaround to strengthening the business to a sustainable growth. We are now in a position to prioritize initiatives so we can further accelerate our momentum. 2016 was a year of purposeful change. We dedicated our sales to the actions necessary to get better, stronger McDonald\u2019s. Our objective was to reinforce our foundation and that\u2019s what we did. First, we right-sized our structure, we have been leaner, more efficient, more nimble. We have flattened the organization, so it\u2019s easier to quickly share and scale best practices across like markets and get even closer to our customer. At the same time, we are building a better McDonald\u2019s literally. We recently broke ground on a downtown Chicago office, creating a world class work environment for our staff, and for our franchisees and the restaurant teams who visit Chicago from around the world for training and development. Second, we put the right talent in place. Our leadership team blends individuals with deep McDonald\u2019s experience who are ready to take on more responsibility with new executives who have valuable experience outside of McDonald\u2019s and bring fresh energy and innovative thinking. We have promoted Chris Kempczinski to President of the U.S. Business and Joe Erlinger to President of High-Growth Markets, where they both hit the ground running. We expanded Doug Goare\u2019s role to focus not only on the International Lead markets, but on restaurant execution, lending field and sense of leadership. We expanded Jim Sappington\u2019s role to include oversight of all areas of the customer experience, including digital. And we brought in Lucy Brady to lead Global Corporate Strategy. Previously, Lucy was a senior partner of BCG, where she had more than 20 years of experience driving consumer sense of growth strategies. Third, we sharpened our focus. As we have previously shared, we are not managing the business quarter-by-quarter, we are taking a longer term view. We started leaning in, looking forward and fundamentally changing McDonald\u2019s culture. We are moving faster, pushing harder and taking smarter risks. For example, the pace at which we are expanding experience of the future around the world continues to quicker. I recently visited Spain where I was impressed by the way they have started bringing experience of the future to light in restaurants around Madrid. A rapid deployment model we are applying to the city has enabled us to dramatically transform the customer experience in the short period of time. And what\u2019s happening in Spain is guiding our rollout strategy in other markets around the world, including the U.S. Across the business, we are prioritizing actions that have the most direct impact on customers. That includes implementing All Day Breakfast in Australia, which we brought in the U.S. playbook, and this is a great demonstration the value our new structure brings to business. Introducing dedicated restaurants start as guest experience leaders in Canada, and taking important steps with our food and how it\u2019s prepared in the U.S., for example, removing artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets. We further elevated our commitments on running great restaurants and customers are noticing. During the course of 2016, we have seen customer satisfaction measures improve in most of our major markets, including the U.S. The purposeful changes we are making also resulted in improved financial results. 2016 was our strongest year of global comparable sales since 2011. All quarter marks sixth consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales which comes after five quarters of global declines. Across the business and around the world, we delivered a solid year. Global comp sales were up 2.7% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Operating income increased 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. Earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter and 16% for the year in constant currencies. Restaurant cash flows grew worldwide and we continue to see all-time highs in many of our major markets, including the U.S. We expected some uneven performance in 2016 and fourth quarter comparable sales were positive in all segments, except for the U.S., where we anticipated a challenging lap due to our successful All Day Breakfast launch in October of 2015. By the markets such as France, Germany and Russia are also working to overcome challenges of varying degrees. With that context, let\u2019s turn to quarterly performance highlights in the markets, starting in the U.S. where comparable sales were down 1.3%. The launch of All Day Breakfast 2.0 is reenergizing customers around our breakfast offerings and is living up to our expectations. We are also seeing pockets of success in regions, but have doubled down on affordability while layering McPick offers alongside beverage value. In an effort to extend that momentum nationwide, we kicked off the new year with a national McCaf\u00e9 beverage value promotion, which leverages our scale advantages and further complements local McDonald\u2019s office. Operationally, we are running better restaurants. Our fourth quarter customer satisfaction scores were up 5% compared to fourth quarter 2015 as our lowest performing quintile of restaurants halved the gap to our top performing quintile. In addition to creating a better customer experience, yet, the significant emphasis we have placed on these underperforming restaurants speaks for the high level of accountability with which we are managing the business. That said, there is more we need to do to reverse guest count trends in the U.S, and we are prepared to hit harder in 2017. Chris and the team have a solid brand that you will hear more about during our March 1 investor meeting. Let\u2019s now turn to the International Lead segments. We had positive comparable sales of 2.8% for the quarter and 3.4% for the full year, driven primarily by the UK, Australia and Canada. The UK delivered another quarter of strong performance, driven by new food news, a steady focus on core classics and value. In particular, the Great Taste of the World food event featured the introduction of sandwiches, which rotates through the market two weeks at a time. Australia continues its positive momentum despite intensified competition in the marketplace. McCaf\u00e9, All Day Breakfast remain big winners there. Canada is another market with consistently strong performance. It\u2019s focused on hospitality, including the addition of guest experience leaders in the restaurant lobbies earlier in 2016, led to the highest guest satisfaction scores on record for December. At the same time, restaurants have now converted to \u2013 restaurants that have converted to Experience of the Future now bring 800 in 2016 alone, are seeing even stronger financial results than most restaurants that are not yet made the switch. Whilst the UK, Australia and Canada remain strong, we see more significant opportunity for improvement in Germany and France. In Germany our actions to improve food quality, enhance the customer experience and take a purposeful approach to value in 2016 are all resonating the price conscious German consumer. We still have more runway, particularly regard towards affordability and we will continue to drive harder on that this year. France is seeing initial signs of recovery as the IEO market is returning to a place of stability. For the first time in over 5 years, IEO market traffic was positive. The team in France is capturing some of that traffic growth by continuing to innovate, bringing to life new ways to order, pay and be served. Web ordering, kiosks and table service are now available in the vast majority of restaurants. Let\u2019s turn to the High Growth segment, where performance was driven by strong results in China. We saw increases in comparable sales in the fourth quarter across all markets, resulting in a positive comp of 4.7% for the segments. For the full year, comparable sales were 2.8%. Notably, China had a strong quarter with comparable sales of 7.9%. We ended the year with solid momentum, due in part to contributions from the core menu and the strong value offerings. At the same time, we found success by continuing to emphasize the convenience we provide to customers through third-party delivery services and dessert kiosks. In the foundational markets, we saw positive comparable sales be 11.1% for the quarter and 10% for the year, with the very strong performance in Japan and certain markets in Latin America throughout 2016, as well as solid results across the segment\u2019s remaining geographic regions. As recent as November, I spent time with the team in Japan to experience firsthand how they are executing the turnaround plan and the ways they balance new food news, value and accessibility supported by the foundation of running great restaurants. Whilst we have been creating customer notable change in restaurants around the world, we have continued to enhance financial value. We simply be forensic with our finances and we have been. First, we are putting more restaurants and even in tight markets in the hands of local owners. We devoted significant energy to ownership changes in 2016 and those efforts continue this year. Specifically, Malaysia and Singapore are locally owned as of December. Our partners in these markets bring in experience in running great restaurants with 20 years of the development for licensee with nearly 100 restaurants in Saudi Arabia. Both markets will be managed by seasoned McDonald\u2019s executives with local experience. This partnership will create around brand excitement for customers and new opportunities for people as these markets continue to grow and develop. Early this month, we announced a strategic partnership in China and Hong Kong. This structure blends our global brand with partnership bringing deep insight into both markets. Citic and the Carlyle Group have established records of success in the region and share our principles and values. Furthermore, we expect this will be a powerful driver of growth, unlocking financial value in the region and enabling further expansion of the business. We have now either completed or reached agreement on almost all of our all more significant ownership transactions. Second, we continue to make progress against our G&A target, we right-sized the organization, enabling our market teams to focus even more of their time and energy on actions that directly benefit customers. Kevin will share more of G&A in his remarks. Finally, we fulfilled the commitments to return $30 billion to shareholders over a 3-year period ending 2016. Taken together, these actions to enhance financial value enable us to prioritize critical investments to support our long-term strategy, which we will discuss along with updated long-term financial targets, in greater detail in March. Our focus is on growing guest counts, as we have recognized the ultimate lifestyle of our business. We have done significant work to understand how and where to put energy to continue driving profitable results. And we look forward to sharing that with you in just a few weeks. We are now fit for purpose and better positioned to build on our success. I am confident we are stronger, more capable business today than we were 2 years ago. We have built a strong base and now it\u2019s the time to shift our focus to strengthening and growing the business for the long-term. That said, we will face challenges, some within our control and others beyond. As I mentioned, we are dealing with varying macroeconomic pressures and general economic volatility in many markets, including Russia and France. In Q1, well, results have included a leap day, favorable weather in many places around the world and a continued benefit from the launch of All Day Breakfast in the U.S. At the same time, I remain very optimistic about our steady progress to be a better McDonald\u2019s as we work to be recognized by customers as the modern progressive burger company. As I think about where we were, how far we have come and our potential, I am convinced we are on the right path to achieve this ambition. 2017 is the year during which we will spend up and lead as we shift to more of a long-term focus. Thanks everyone. And now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Steve and good morning, everyone. By staying sharply focused on our customers, we maintained positive global momentum while continuing to make further progress on our journey towards building a better McDonald\u2019s. We are pleased with our financial performance in 2016, which reflects broad based improvements in our operating performance from the top to the bottom line. At the top line, our global comparable sales performance of 3.8% represented our strongest consolidated results since 2011. And every segment was positive for the second consecutive year. Our bottom line performance was equally strong as full year operating income grew $600 million or 11% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 16% in constant currencies, both of which exceeded our performance goals for the year. Steve talked about some of the structural and cultural changes we are making. We are also evolving our financial profile, so I will talk about some of the impacts on our P&L as well as progress on our financial initiatives. Let me start with the performance drivers for the quarter. As we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization, growing sales in the associated franchise revenues is critical, as these continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our overall profitability. For fourth quarter, franchise revenues increased 4% in constant currencies, reflecting positive global comparable sales and the impact of expansion and re-franchising. I am encouraged by these results, particularly considering some of the challenging industry trends in comparison against last year\u2019s fourth quarter comparable sales, which were our strongest in more than 3 years. Franchise margin dollars reached $1.9 billion for the quarter, a 4% increase in constant currencies and contributed over half of our growth in consolidated operating income. Our solid margin performance reflects sales driven improvements, led by results in our major markets. The operating results are a demonstration of the benefits of our re-franchising strategy, which include creating a stable, predictable royalty stream and reducing G&A and capital levels over time. And our refranchising strategy enables us to reduce our asset exposure and enhance our ability to more quickly grow our restaurant base to the market potential. While company-operated margins continue to represent a smaller component of our global operating income, what\u2019s important is that we continue to drive higher restaurant profitability as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution to our bottom line. For the quarter, company-operated margins improved 170 basis points over the prior year led by China and the U.S. We benefited from a benign commodity environment in 2016, although we continue to experience labor inflation in many markets around the world. Menu pricing is one way to help mitigate some of these cost pressures. We ended 2016 with a 2.8% price increase in the U.S. relatively in line with food-away-from-home inflation of 2.3%. For comparison, the International Lead market averaged price increases of about 2%. We are mindful of the disparity between grocery store inflation and food-away-from-home, so we will continue to carefully balance strategic pricing decisions with our focus on growing guest counts. Shifting gears now to an update on our financial targets. While we have been focused on customer noticeable change in the restaurants, over the course of the last year, we have also applied rigor and discipline towards meeting our cash return to shareholders, refranchising and G&A targets. As Steve mentioned, 2016 marked the completion of our 3-year $30 billion cash return to shareholders, and nearly one-third of our current market capitalization, this achievement as well as our recent 6% dividend increase, serves as a vote of confidence in our business and the sustainability of our significant cash flows. In addition to the achievement of our cash return target, I want to provide some perspective on the notable progress we have made around refranchising in G&A. Starting with our global refranchising efforts, from the beginning of 2015, through the announcement of our strategic partnership with Citic and the Carlyle Group earlier this month, we have made significant progress on our refranchising goals. By mid-2017, we expect to have re-franchised over 3,500 restaurants towards our goal of refranchising 4,000 by the end of 2018. The China, Hong Kong transaction, which is expected to close midyear, is the most significant transaction of our refranchising efforts, resulting in the sale of more than 1,750 company-owned stores. From a strategic standpoint, this transaction puts more of our restaurants under local ownership and blends our global brand with local partners who bring deep knowledge, insights and resources into both markets. We will retain a 20% ownership stake in the business in order to continue supporting and participating in the growth of both China and Hong Kong. From a financial standpoint, this strategic partnership will enable us to more quickly unlock our growth potential in China as we pursue accelerated expansion and innovation while spending no ongoing capital and limited G&A resources. The new enterprise is slated to open over 1,500 restaurants over the next 5 years, reflecting a much quicker opening pace than the 1,200 new openings achieved in the previous 5 years. With more than 2,400 restaurants today at this pace, China will quickly become the second largest McDonald\u2019s market in the system. With a total enterprise value of around $2 billion, we currently expect cash proceeds of about $1.5 billion. Following the transaction, our income stream will consist of royalties on 100% of the restaurant sales in China and Hong Kong as well as our 20% share of the enterprise\u2019s earnings. Initially, the net impact of this transaction will be somewhat dilutive to our operating income. However, we expect to return to a similar income level in a few years. For perspective, remember that today, China and Hong Kong represent less than 5% of our consolidated operating income. From an operating margin, financial return and free cash flow perspective, the transaction will be immediately accretive as we will not make ongoing capital investments in these markets. We are currently finalizing our plans for the cash proceeds and will provide an update at our investor meeting in March. In addition to the China, Hong Kong transaction, there are several other smaller transactions, which are in various stages of the refranchising process. We will provide additional information on these and future transactions as appropriate. We are also committed to be more efficient with our G&A spending. From a qualitative standpoint, the objective of our G&A and capital discipline is to focus our resources and talent where it matters most and customer-facing activities that drive business growth. At the same time, we are evolving to a more efficient, globalized system that better leverages our size and supports rapid testing and scaling of initiatives that address these growth opportunities. We have made meaningful progress towards our goal of reducing our net G&A levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from our 2015 plan of $2.6 billion. Our actions over the past 2 years have resulted in realized savings of more than $200 million, exceeding our original expectation of $150 million in savings by the end of 2016. These actions include redesigning our entire organization to eliminate layers and increase spans of control resulting in headcount reductions in both the corporate staff and across our business segments; more centralization of non-customer facing business processes; and executing against our refranchising targets, which will significantly reduce market level G&A spending. For perspective, our year-end earnings release separates base G&A, which reflects the impact of these actions from incentive-based compensation. This more detailed disclosure provides visibility into the base G&A savings achieved during 2016. Partially offsetting these savings in 2016 was higher incentive-based compensation, reflecting financial performance that exceeded internal targets, which are primarily based on operating income and earnings per share growth. The improvements in our sales, restaurant profitability and G&A spending resulted in a near-record high operating margin of 31.5% for 2016, up from 28.1% in 2015. So, as we look to the future, we will leverage our recent success and build upon it. We are financially stronger than we were a year ago. We are making steady progress on our financial initiatives and we are seeing better operating results. We are confident that we are on the right path. In March, we look forward to providing more detail about our global strategy, the initiatives we are investing in and how they will enable us to deliver sustained, long-term profitable growth for our system and our shareholders. Thanks. Now, I will turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nA - Chris Stent: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Quick question on the traffic per store, it looks like it\u2019s been down for a few years now. I think it might be down 10% since 2012 when you eased away from that dollar menu at least domestically. Cash flow seems like it\u2019s strong per restaurant though. And in this morning\u2019s release, you said that the company is going to continue to focus on traffic. Could you perhaps elaborate as to why traffic declines can perhaps reverse this year and what that focus will mean? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, thanks, David. No, you are actually spot on. It\u2019s not a 1 year trend. It\u2019s been slightly longer. It is something that dominates our conversations. We plan our business. And certainly, the other operators are very mindful of it as well, particularly here in the U.S. actually. This is all about getting the balance right. I mean, the cash flow growth through 2016 was phenomenal for our U.S. owner operators. And frankly, there never has been a better time to be an owner operator in the McDonald\u2019s system than there is right now. And part of the discussions we are having certainly Chris Kempczinski and his leadership team or the owner operator leaderships is how and where do we reinvest that strength in the business back on behalf of the customers. So I guess two things that you will see more of through the course of this year that we believe we saw the guest count trends. One is around the investment and the experience of the future. So that is something that we have had great success in many of our more mature markets around the world, where we are really investing front of house to put more choice controller in the hands of customers where it\u2019s around how they order, what they order, how they serve, how they pay. So that\u2019s something where we have a great track record around the world and we are looking to deploy that aggressively in the U.S. And then the other piece where we solidify our own value. The McPick menu really does work well for customers, whether it\u2019s the McPick 5 or the McPick the more value end, whether its $2, $2.50, but that alone isn\u2019t winning us the market share fight and the value end. So you will have seen solid this year that we have an aggressive McCaf\u00e9 beverage value offer, which is $1 any size coffee or $2 on the small specialty McCaf\u00e9 beverages. You can expect to see us be more competitive at a value end through the year. I mean, it\u2019s been encouraging in the way that, that has \u2013 that has resonated the customers as we have entered the New Year. And our experience when we analyzed the regions that have been most successful around the U.S. the three or four top performing regions over the last year or two are those that have managed to combine the national value platform with the more local, aggressive for those beverage or food let price offers, value and price offers. So we are lifting that learning and I think all the right we were engaged in right conversations and customers will benefit.\nChris Stent: Next question is Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. My questions with respect to the International Lead markets and the franchise, I mean just looking at that and I know you did a pretty strong comp there of 2.8% positive. I am just curious why that wasn\u2019t maybe providing a little bit more leverage on the franchise side. It looked like that franchise margin came back a little bit. Can you talk about the dynamic or some of the pushes and pulls that might have resulted in the \u2013 little bit more modest margin pressure than you saw in the third quarter, where it expanded modestly?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Matt, it\u2019s Kevin. Thanks for the question. You know we generally get pretty good leverage from sums on the franchise margin side as more of those costs obviously are fixed certainly than on the company operated side. A couple of things on the franchise margin and specifically in the International Lead markets, a little piece of that is as we reduce some of our refranchising, we are generally selling lower volume restaurants with potentially lower margins. And so in the near-term, it impacts the franchise margin percent a little bit on the International Lead \u2013 on those International Lead markets. And then the other thing that we do see certainly is some of the occupancy costs internationally, specifically some of the leads costs continue to pressure a little bit margins. But the franchise margin certainly more than McOpCo margin is driven by comp sales. They are definitely a top line game. And as long as we can continue to drive positive comp sales, we should be pretty good on those margins being healthy.\nSteve Easterbrook: Matt, there is one other thing I would add to that, which is we have \u2013 we talk about a very unique business model and relationship with the way that we have with our owner operators around the 20-year franchise and that the mutual benefits in investing together. We are probably \u2013 2016 was probably a peak year actually for some of the co-investment programs that we have been doing hand in hand with our owner operators in most lead markets, where we will put up some of the support to enable them to accelerate some of these investments. Now we are seeing on the top line, we are seeing on our bottom line, so we know it makes sense. And as the lead markets begin to get towards the end of that cycle on this reinvestment, I think this is a chance to focus our attention here on the U.S. which you can expect to see as well.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to follow-up on David Palmer\u2019s question from earlier. These solid cash flow metrics per store had been really good despite the traffic declines you see in the business. And I think the obvious reasons are the average check growth has offset the traffic declines for the comp and then food commodity deflation has helped boost the margins. And so you kind of talked about restoring traffic when you responded to David\u2019s question, but my question is how exactly do you keep the average checkup in 2017 and going forward, given that you like to price more towards food at home, which is deflation and the fact that you are focusing more on value and price offers?\nSteve Easterbrook: So Brian, what we have typically seen around \u2013 it\u2019s a very huge question. So I mean if it would seem like an obvious trait. But the reality is what we have seen around the world, the more customers we drive into our restaurants, the greater the top line growth and the greater the cash flow growth. So if that impacts margin percent a little and it may do or actually do the dollar amount or the euro amount or the yen amount on bottom line, both for the company and if the owner/operator improves. It is a delicate balance, 2016 was a \u2013 there was a lovely cycle from the cash flow with commodities at an all-time low and probably as aggressive as we would be want to be on pricing. I think we are going to bring \u2013 you will see us just bring just carefully bring pricing back more in line with food away from home, which we begin to see now. But the realty is and this is on the new discussion for us in our business. Again, going back to the 20-year franchise agreement, we all know that for the benefit of our owner/operator businesses over the long-term, you are got to be serving our customers more often. So that\u2019s way we return to. But we know we can grow profitably and cash flow can grow alongside that.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Steve, just continuing on the team of asking about the U.S. business, it seems like the hallmark of the McDonald\u2019s system has been built around speed of service and it seems like over the past several years, McDonald\u2019s may have gotten a bit slower, so can you talk about where you are at this system in terms of speed of service and how you are thinking about that as part of your traffic driving program, especially as sort of tie-in experience of the future, which includes some customization elements, so any thoughts there would be helpful?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. No. Thank you. Thanks David. Speed of service has declined slightly, it\u2019s handful of seconds slower by the end of \u201816 and we were by the end of \u201815. So I guess there is a number of things we are trying to do. You will hear me talk about or heard me referring the thoughts around net simplification where if we are going to introduce new menu items, new ideas, we got to reduce the complexity by at least, if not more than the same amount. So our operations teams, particularly in the U.S. are deeply focused on that and just simplification isn\u2019t just on the menu, it could be on different operational processes. It could be the use of technology stated on the manual work out of the way, simplifying just the merchandising all the way through training programs in the restaurants and making them more efficient and more effective. So there is a number of different pillars to our simplification efforts. With regard to Experience of the Future, I think this absolutely addresses the speed of service issue in a way that consumers are in control of. So if you wanted to \u2013 maybe you enter a restaurant, you are with your family and you want to spend a little more time ordering at the self order kiosks and you want accustom, you can dwell for as long as you want, placing your order, getting it right, enjoying the moment together. And then a plenty of time together just be able to go and sit at the table and we will bring it out to you. If you are wanting that from counter speed of service in a traditional way, effectively I would see that speeding up, because effectively, some of the larger orders will not be there at the front counter and they will just be the more grab and go type customers. So \u2013 and simply on the drive through, we \u2013 as we develop and continue to invest in technology and we get our order ahead and our order and pay capabilities through the app, better defined by through the course of this year. Then a lot of the elements of the McDonald\u2019s experience that can slow it down, not just for you, but maybe the customer behind you in the line are taken out of it. So, we believe we can have technology to a lot of that heavy lifting and any of the experience be better and the service charge will improve as a result.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thanks. Good morning. In the U.S, when you think about grocery store deflation, if it were to lessen, do you expect to have more guests that were eating at home or turn that would account for increases in guest traffic or would you expect to have more pricing power to use with the current guests you have? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Hey, Nicole. Thanks for the question. Yes, we do expect kind of the food at home, I\u2019ll call it deflation to ease or not be as favorable as it was in 2016. The IEO industry is still projected to be relatively muted in 2017. But I think what it does is, as you know, we look at various factors when we look at pricing. We will look at food-away-from-home inflation and food-at-home inflation and competitors to determine the right kind of approach to our pricing. I think it gives us an opportunity to potentially gain some customers back that are right now eating at home. Again, as Steve mentioned early, we do have to be careful on the pricing side with balancing price increases with continuing to grow guest counts. And so we will take a close look to make sure that we don\u2019t get too far ahead on our pricing at the expense of guest counts. But certainly, if grocery store prices continue to rise or our guests favorable in 2016, we view that as a positive for some of our traffic.\nSteve Easterbrook: Nicole, it\u2019s just a different perspective on the same question actually. It\u2019s typically clearly we have always been part of the food-away-from-home market. You may have noticed, we have been curious here as to whether there is an opportunity for us to serve the food at home market as well. So, we have initiated very, very early stages to small pilot test down in Florida to see whether home delivery could be something that helps to address consumer demands both at home as well as us making their demand when they are away from home. So, that doesn\u2019t necessarily obviously your pricing equation, but it\u2019s \u2013 we are curious as to whether the demand is there for food-at-home is something that we could also play a part in.\nChris Stent: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. I had a question about the SG&A. First just a specific what is your sense of timing of when you are going to get the full 500 changed? I think initially you said most of it in \u201817 maybe the refranchising has changed that a little bit and then so \u201817 versus \u201818 quantity? And then, secondly, is it right to think that $2.1 billion is the right number or is there going to be some reinvestment in the business or growth in SG&A over time. It sounded like Steve, from your language in the release, that we are redirecting some capital in G&A spending towards strategic initiatives. So, I am wondering if you are shifting a little more to putting more money back into the business and therefore the $2.1 billion is the right anchor point for G&A in \u201818.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, John. Couple of pieces of that question. One, I would say we are on track certainly with our original plan through 2016, if not potentially a little bit ahead from a timing perspective. We will give a little more update at the investor meeting in March as far as kind of how we think about G&A through 2018 as well as going forward. The one other piece I would say is when we gave that target and we have not changed on this is it\u2019s a net savings target meaning that it contemplates a reinvestment within it. So we are not going to say that we are saving money and then reinvesting it all so that you don\u2019t see kind of a net reduction in G&A. You should expect to see a net reduction in G&A that also incorporates what we need to invest in the business in order to grow.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, John, just to tag on any comments you heard me say previously, I am firmly of the belief that we do have sufficient resource given the targets that Kevin outlined. Part of the culture that we are embracing here is to create a higher \u2013 a heightened level of competition for those resources. If you have a limited fall of capital and that limited fall of G&A, only the best and biggest ideas get funded, so whether that\u2019s the market level or corporate level. And I was on the receiving end of that when I was a Managing Director back in the UK and you had to fight for your capital. You had to demonstrate you could deliver better returns than the person in the market next to you, not in antagonistic way, but it was a performance-based environment. And as we have heightened accountability across our business, that\u2019s part of it. So I think we don\u2019t see those numbers going back up again. I think there is sufficient resource for us to deliver the great growth that we are filing.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. In the second quarter you made some nice drive in the refranchising initiatives, but your gains were little light relative to the average in the first three quarters of 2015. So I was wondering can you speak out to the geographic mix of stores you are franchised whether it\u2019s proceeds through store in 4Q relative to what you did in the first 9 months of the year? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Andrew. So, the refranchising is impacted by a couple of things. One, it depends on where we are refranchising obviously, but it also depends on whether we are refranchising individual stores or potentially what I will entire markets kind of the developmental licensee. What you will have seen in 2015 and for a large piece of 2016 is that a lot of the refranchising would be in our markets, in the foundation segment, as well as a little bit in the high growth segment. And a couple of the markets in the International Lead segment, where we are doing more of our conventional franchising, it does get impacted by the mix of stores within every country as well as how far along each country is in their franchising journey, if you will. So, some that have more ways to go, let\u2019s say, may get higher proceeds at the beginning as they are selling some higher volume stores. As they get near the end of their refranchising, they are now selling generally lower volume restaurants and then wouldn\u2019t have the same level of proceeds. So no, you can see relatively swing \u2013 relative swings from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year depending on the mix of which countries are actually selling the restaurants.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Greg Francfort of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nGreg Francfort: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about remodeling, particularly in the U.S. where you stand the kind of returns you are seeing on the remodeled stores and I guess how you view it? Do you view part of the investment is made into capital, some of it as growth capital. I guess, how do you look at that sort of cost and return framework?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, thanks, Greg. Right now, we are little over halfway through the restaurants are being modernized in the U.S. As you know, we are certainly much farther along in most of the international countries, where we are certainly more modernized and are just now investing in the experience of the future aspects of it. In the U.S, a lot of our restaurants need to have both the experience of the future elements as well as the remodeling perspective. In general, in the U.S., we have seen kind of 5% to 6% sales bumps as we remodel a restaurant or bring it up to modernize standards. That\u2019s relatively consistent around the world. It ranges a little bit. But I would say kind of the 5% to 6% sales above market is a pretty good threshold that we use. And the U.S, you will hear some more plans as we get into our March 1 investor event, but we are planning to continue to modernize the U.S. state over the next few years.\nSteve Easterbrook: And Greg, just to add to that, I mean, Kevin is absolutely right. Maintenance spend is largely the responsibility of the owner-operator. So, we will have maintenance spend in our small full of McOpCo restaurants. So fundamentally, our capital investment and our co-investment is on growth initiatives, whether that\u2019s \u2013 and that will be customer facing either it gives us a chance to enhance the menu or enhance the experience. So, we are very much growth focused in how we invest directly or co-invest our capital dollars?\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeremy Scott of CLSA.\nJeremy Scott: Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the store consolidation in the U.S. First, how many stores would you estimate are expected to come off the system over the next 3 to 5 years? And then just from the context of the guest count discussion, into what extent is McDonald\u2019s exposure to weakening retail trade zones impacting traffic? Is there a new equilibrium point for store penetration in the U.S.?\nSteve Easterbrook: So, the eating out market, Germany is huge. And we see IEO as modest, very modest growth potential, but a gentle growth potential over the next handful of years. So that push you into a market share and without still having a relatively small percentage of that overall and formal eating out market, there is plenty of customers out there eating out. We just need to fight harder and make sure that we earn the right models to turn our way. So I believe there is guest count growth potential there if we do the right things. With regard to the new restaurants, I don\u2019t know if Kevin has anymore details, but we are typically a net growth company. We have had about 1 or 2 years over the last decade where we have looked to address the portfolio that we have chosen to take a particular project and just deal with the title, the locations, which are no longer appropriate for us. But I don\u2019t see that they have contraction frankly.\nKevin Ozan: Globally, certainly, you would see several, probably net near the 1,000 restaurants that we have been on track. I will say in the U.S, you wouldn\u2019t see a lot of growth over the next couple of years as we will probably focus most of our investment dollars on the experience of the future and remodeling as we talked about.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy: Good morning. Can you provide for us a little bit more updates on the technology front specifically what you are expecting out of the U.S. as you expand out your mobile and your mobile ordering? And also if there is any reference points you can give us from either Scandinavia, Australia or France that provides any background for what kind of sales lifts or returns you are expecting and how are you quantifying what\u2019s the success on it? Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, thanks, Greg. Well, I mean, the quantification is satisfied customers and growth in sales and transactions. So I mean we have got absolutely hard measure expectations, because we are investing significantly in technology as our owner operators. Just to give you some texture here in the U.S, for example, where we have launched the global mobile app launch here in the U.S., we have now had 18 million downloads. We have had over 11 million of those are registered users. And the month of December 2016 saw the greatest contribution to sales by the app that we have seen yet and that has been growing month by month by month. It\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s noticeable now, but not material. So clearly, our ambition is to make that a material number. Elsewhere around the world, we are testing different elements through technology that we can then put together. So for example, order ahead \u2013 order and pay, for example, whether it\u2019s through the internet or through the app, we are testing that. We are testing curbside check-in where if you pull on to the parking lot, you can actually pull up into a dedicated bay where you can just scan your order, we can bring it out to you. Plus also, a lot of the in-restaurant technology, maximizing the consumer benefit of the self-order kiosks. Again, you can just check your pre-order and just scan it at kiosk and sit straight down and get your table service and also to help support and that is around the whole area of CR loyalty where we have a huge opportunity. Again, acknowledging there are others who are further ahead than us, but this is one where you got to get it right. It\u2019s better to be right than to be first to market. And so we are investing a lot of time and effort to best understand what resonates most with customers in terms of appreciating that business and encouraging them more often. But ultimately, at the moment, we are focusing on the experience side, order, pay, curbside check-in, and just making that experience smoother, easier, more convenient and then we\u2019ll start building reward mechanisms into that over time.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.\nJason West: Yes, thanks. Just one quick follow-up and then a question, on the G&A targets, Kevin, I just wanted to confirm if that includes or excludes the movement in incentive comp that we have seen since you originally gave those targets. And then a bigger picture question on the March 1 meeting, if you guys, I don\u2019t know if you want to give details. But just what\u2019s the kind of purpose of this meeting? Is it just to lay out the \u201817 guidance or is there more in terms of longer term targets and things like that, that you are going to be discussing at that meeting? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Jason. Let me start with the G&A. Just to give perspective, the \u2013 as most companies do, total incentive comp is higher and lower in any given year depending on the company performance. So you will see in our earnings release, we split out incentive comp, so you can see that phenomenon, if you will. And you will see that in 2015, we incurred a little over $300 million of incentive comp. That was at below targeted performance for us. In 2016, you will see that we have a little over $400 million of incentive comp and that was significantly above target performance for us. So certainly, depending on our performance in a year and that\u2019s generally operating income growth and EPS growth. That line could swing from 1 year to the next. Having said that, a couple of points I want to make, one is, going into 2017 and as you would imagine, we reset that number to 100% as we go into plan every year, not knowing where we will end up obviously. As we go into to 2017, so I mentioned that in 2015, we had over $300 million, and that was at a below target performance. Going into 2017, our plan at 100%, total incentive comp will be less than $300 million. So we are saving some incentive comp on our base plan because we have less people obviously. Second, the other thing I just want to make sure that everyone is focused on is, our focus is really on growing operating margin. And that you know while we are focused on saving G&A and making sure we are efficient, I am not 100% certain that everyone in the industry classifies all the costs exactly in the same line item within a P&L. And so we are focused on operating margin because that\u2019s kind of the bottom line of how efficient are you at bringing your total revenues down at the bottom line. So just wanted to make those a few points related to the G&A. And then the operating margin as I mentioned, we grew that substantially in 2016 from 28.1% to 31.5%. Related to the March 1, Investor Event, there will be a few components of it. One, we will talk about 2017 guidance. As Chris mentioned, we normally have an outlook section that gives you 2017 guidance in there. We didn\u2019t have that in there this time, because we thought we could give you half the sorry without all the context. So it would be easier to do this all at once on March 1. And so part of what it will be 2017 outlook if you will. But it also be talking about our longer term strategies and long-term financial targets and how we expect to get there. And so that\u2019s where a chunk of the time will be spent on March 1 at that Investor Event.\nSteve Easterbrook: Hey Jason, just add to that, we are confident and we are excited about where we got the business to over the last 2 years. And we are certainly quite excited about the plans we have had, I mean just to be clear, we are planning growth and like-for-like growth in every major market around the world in 2017 and beyond. And we want to share they are the find the best way that we can share that excitement and build the credibility and the confidence in \u2013 that you can match our confidence and excitement. So rather just listen to the plan, we thought it would be fun to have you to actually experience the plan. So this will be surely some content, some meaningful content on the table, so this will be an experiential day for you as well. So we can take people through some of the components that we believe are customer driven will drive that guest count growth we talk about drive business growth, drive profitability. But it will be a varied and fun day and something \u2013 somewhat unique I think in Investor Day, so I am looking forward to that a lot.\nChris Stent: Okay. We are near the top of the hour. So I will turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing comments.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you, Chris. And given that this is Chris\u2019 last earnings call with McDonald\u2019s, I would like to take a moment to personally acknowledge Chris and the significant role he has played, not only building and leading a first class IR team, but also the trust advisor to Kevin and me. On behalf of everyone at McDonald\u2019s, we bring these words and culture over the years, Chris, thank you very much. We wish you all the best on your new endeavors. And again, thanks to everyone else for joining us this morning. So in closing, I want to reemphasize how encouraged I am by the progress we have made. 2016 was a year of purposeful change. We have built the foundation that\u2019s enabling us to transition from turnaround to longer term growth. We remain focused on the basics of running great restaurants, at the same time, driving operating growth, building brand excitement and enhancing financial value. As a result, we are now in a position to prioritize initiatives will further strengthen our business. We look forward to talking more about our plans in March. As we step up and lead in 2017, I am energized about the opportunities ahead and eager to continue our journey to assert McDonald\u2019s as the global leader of the IEO industry. Thanks to all of you. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call. Thank you.

And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Chris, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m encouraged by the actions we\u2019ve taken and the progress we have made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions of McDonald\u2019s have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marked five consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments and many markets gaining share. For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5%; operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% on constant currencies. Profitability has increased both for McDonald\u2019s and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets including the U.S. These results are testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we\u2019ve begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that\u2019s concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term. We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven and it has been. Markets such as the UK, Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst markets including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees. We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as lap the very successful introduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular with customers. However, we are not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We\u2019ve taken action in the areas that matter most to customers. In particular, we\u2019re placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald\u2019s. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we\u2019ll build as we work to be recognized as a modern progressive burger company by customers. In the area of food, we\u2019re taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated with antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule. We introduced new buns that do not contain a high-fructose corn syrup. And we\u2019ve removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news, and we\u2019ve seen sales accelerated as a result. Following the announcement, the sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10% and they\u2019re sustaining above previous levels. We\u2019re also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. In Canada, we\u2019re engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways offering them more choices in how they order or pay. We now have dual point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we\u2019re taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada\u2019s traditional restaurants. Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany for example, we\u2019ve deployed a two-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layer to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we\u2019re celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that\u2019s resonating well with the price conscious German consumer. The actions we\u2019re taking specific to our food, the customer experience and value and telling customers about the changes, all are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we\u2019ve made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year. With that context, let\u2019s turn to performance highlights in the market. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we\u2019ve continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked even more choices. So, we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. Expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits, as well as our beloved McGriddles all-day in all U.S. restaurants. At the same time, we\u2019re enhancing experience to adapt alongside customers\u2019 expectations. One of the most notable ways we\u2019re doing this in the restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they\u2019re less congested and better organized, the menus now do a further job highlighting the board range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart; the robust content management system that we haven\u2019t even become tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we\u2019ll be able to adjust what to feature on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We\u2019ll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurrys on a hot summer day, or a handcrafted hot McCaf\u00e9 beverages if it\u2019s chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up. We also continue to emphasize value because we know how much budget-oriented customers count to McDonald\u2019s. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on local level. Some of our best performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We\u2019ll continue to tap into these learnings both nationally and locally as we design future McPick offers. Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most for our bottom quintile restaurants. And we\u2019ve cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in a half through our efforts provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant, every time they visit. Turing to the International Lead market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across four of the five major markets with France being exception. The UK, Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underly [ph] their strong track records of success. Contemporary restaurants designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged. Compelling menu strategy is tailored to local customer tastes, such as the Spice it Up event in Canada featuring Spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich. And modern service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility in how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference by customers who then reward us by visiting more often. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience firsthand while I visited the team their last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter. Earlier, I mentioned the steps we\u2019ve taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the Hamburger Royale with cheese, these actions are making a difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again. That said, I want to stress that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That\u2019s the key to winning back the share we\u2019ve lost in recent years. In France, third quarter comparables sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns of personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. The customers appreciate the actions we\u2019ve taken to strengthen our value offer including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful Petite Plaisirs value platform. We\u2019re also satisfying French consumers growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we\u2019re introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to customers even more great tasting burger choices at convenience and value they come to appreciate at McDonalds. In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5% driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China. Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China was down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China\u2019s comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter. A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst a still challenging macroeconomic environment. In Russia, the economy remains difficult as consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we\u2019re growing comparable sales and guest count, and gaining market share. Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the breakfast daypart. And I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Japan where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution of the market\u2019s comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience is enhancing McDonald\u2019s relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market. As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus, and lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald\u2019s system. We\u2019ve taken steps forward in all four areas to set the proper foundation for long-term growth. First, the right structure. Building on last year\u2019s shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to better share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment. Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders; they have the right skills necessary to grow the business, and attracting new executives, into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking. I am confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald\u2019s USA, effective the 1st of January. As part of a thoughtful transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field. In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea. Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we\u2019re putting greater emphasis on acceleration initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we\u2019re looking to roll out with greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they\u2019re finalized. And lastly, accountability. We\u2019ve made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now, we\u2019re starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer term growth. We\u2019ll take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern, progressive burger company. We have a long term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I\u2019m confident in the actions we\u2019re taking to run better restaurants and the investments we\u2019re making. We\u2019re getting the right people, foundations, and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald\u2019s global brand leadership. Thanks very much. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results. By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald. Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I\u2019ll focus on margins and G&A. I\u2019ll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we\u2019ve made against our financial targets. Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over a $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales-driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead markets. In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream. Growth in Company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as Company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls is yielding a better experience for our customers, as well as improved restaurant profitability. In the U.S., the Company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect a benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our Company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom-line. Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016 with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs, resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million. Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S. commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment\u2019s full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year. While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we made pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth, and supports restaurant profitability. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%. For U.S. Company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time. So, we maybe a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450 basis-point GAAP between the costs of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and maybe impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%. Next, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which would bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today\u2019s call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announce G&A savings targets. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisors to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending an organizational structure from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field. Our overall goal was to focus our resources and talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth, while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies. As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization. We\u2019re positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast moved from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we\u2019re accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I am confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today\u2019s rapidly changing environment. As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018 with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year. We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly a 1,000 restaurants including a 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we\u2019re also actively pursuing a transaction in China where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders. In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are Company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year. Given where the transactions stand, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses. As we moved into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 Company-operated restaurants in the euro region of Russia to an existing developmental licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So, we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and will continue to keep you apprised of our progress. Last November, we increased our three-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the Company\u2019s 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders. As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our three-year target stands at nearly $28 billion and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year. To summarize, over the course of the last year, we\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieved nearly one-third of our G&A savings target and completed more than one-third of our restaurant refranchising with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017. We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we are appropriately allocating our resources to strategic operating plans that will grow our business. As we move in to the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near-term but we\u2019re keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long-term. Through our actions, we\u2019re unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long-term for our system and our shareholders. Thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nA - Chris Stent: Thanks Kevin. We will now open the call for analysts and investor questions. The first question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. A question on the U.S. A common perception of McDonald\u2019s U.S. is that All Day Breakfast and McPick 2, the value message, these are the real the big two and they are running out of gases, sales drivers. There is not a lot else going on -- and at least this is a common perception. Perhaps you can comment on these two initiates. And relatively, can you comment on the inventory of tested marketing renovation, innovation value as you look into 2017, are you getting better visibility on U.S. growth? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Hi, David. Steve, I\u2019ll take this one. So, first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and McPick 2, so that was the -- they are two of the foundational elements of what\u2019s helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So, as you know, All Day Breakfast around this time last year, it served us well. As you know, the initial peak was higher than we expected and it settled down to a level that we are very happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform both operationally and making sure the consumer demand was there and they extended it just a couple of weeks ago as well, three or four weeks ago. So that is here to stay, is doing well for us and is a foundational element of our business momentum. Similarly, it really is well-embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So, as you know, we tried both, McPick 2 for 5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level and we\u2019ll be bringing that back, I don\u2019t know, three, four times a year and hitting at a national level and so using the flexibility of that platform to rotate different items through that menu. But, what you don\u2019t see perhaps so visibly is across the regions is how the Pick 2 is always on. And typically the regions will use a greater value element like a McPick 2 for 2.50, McPick 2 for 2, McPick 2 for 3, and again depending on seasonality and the customer preference we\u2019ll rotate products through there. So, both those platforms are good contributors to us and are important part of our business going forward. In terms of what we\u2019ve got to be excited about going forward, there\u2019s plenty and the part of what we\u2019re enjoying about the new structure in this business is the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what\u2019s creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they\u2019ve simplified the structure in the U.S., what\u2019s working on a regional level. So, there is a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at regional level, but we\u2019re looking to learn from and lift where appropriate. Earlier this quarter, I spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona, and then went up to Portland in Oregon, and one common success factor in both those regions, both of them are the strongest sales regions we have in the U.S. currently, and what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform alongside fundamentals of running better restaurants. So, there are these pockets of great success that we\u2019re looking to lift and localize and then launch rapidly. But the other piece that I always come back to and I won\u2019t hesitate to coming back to is probably the most important element of what has established momentum in the U.S. is the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental, and it may not be a headline grabber. So, if you think about the 27, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are going in significantly right direction. And again, we have a number of ways we\u2019re looking to improve the operational experience including using technology to make it more easier and more convenient for customers. So, we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we\u2019re scanning the horizon, clearly. I mean, you\u2019ve seen the success of the very -- very consistent solid success across the International Lead markets, and there are certain common success stories across those, most notably how they\u2019re embracing what they\u2019re calling and describing the Experience of the Future, which is how we use modern facilities are totally redefined, front of house hospitality experience, use of technology with self order kiosks for example, integrating that with mobile apps and again offering a degree and appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menu. So, again, you can expect us to incorporate some of those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward.\nChris Stent: Next question\u2019s from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Two questions from me. I don\u2019t think you shared the [Technical Difficulty] sandwich and you commented on the past on the consistency of that gap. So, can you disclose the number and also the cadence of the 3Q? And then, Steve, with the departure of several key leaders from the senior team combined with the focus on becoming more nimble, reach faster decisions, can you talk about the bench of talent that remains following these changes? I know obviously you mentioned new executives coming in for fresh perspectives but anything more to just give assurance around the changes would be helpful.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, sure. First of all, on the gap, competitive gap, we had a positive gap for the quarter. Positive gap was 0.6%. As you know, it\u2019s a market shift I tell that really is a scramble. There is certainly a softening top-line across the sector with consumer confidence. All of us in this sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look out, there aren\u2019t many tailwinds at the moment. There is not great economic growth to help provide a lift; consumer confidence is muted. We\u2019re at a rather unusual stage of the election cycle. So, none of that\u2019s really providing a tailwind for us. That said, there is a significant market out there and we\u2019re going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the gap, there is not a great surprise to us, because it was a particular -- this time last year and heading into the fourth quarter, had [ph] a really strong performance for us. So, the reality is the trends we\u2019re seeing are no surprise to us and certainly aren\u2019t shaking us from our longer term objectives. From a leadership perspective, I\u2019d like to talk about it. I\u2019m exciting about where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re heading into 2017 with really a world-class team that one would expect for world-class business; we have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also need to change. So, it\u2019s a delicate balance between leveraging experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with our more tenured leaders also bringing innovative thinking. But, I can just draw some examples to this. I mean, giving Chris Kempczinski the opportunity and lead the U.S. business, I\u2019m really excited about. Because the reality is whilst he has somewhat limited McDonald\u2019s experience, a, he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands which will be valuable to us. But also let\u2019s not forget that it would take the five or six keys [ph] to direct reporting, he has reporting on this, more than 120 years of McDonald\u2019s U.S. experience amount. [Ph] So, I think we\u2019ve got the McDonald\u2019s experience piece covered with his fresh thinking. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to be a very, very perfect combination. If you look at the role that we\u2019ve created with Doug Goare now, I mean Doug has been around the best part of 40 years. And there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn\u2019t field. He\u2019s had functional leadership, supply chain functional leadership, franchising, real estate as well as field leadership both here in the U.S., previously ran Europe and now he is proving to be a great leader of our International Lead markets. Leveraging Doug\u2019s experience to help blend in with the new experience by Chris, we are one team and that\u2019s a good balance. Joe Erlinger taken the High Growth. I mean Joe started up in U.S. business 15 years ago, again a regional manager very successfully here in U.S. transitioned to become a market leader and Managing Director of the Korean market, has financial experience and became the CFO in the newly formed High Growth market and is perfectly placed to step in and add his energy and insight into leadership position. And then, if you were to talk about for Chris\u2019s transition, we\u2019d already prepared for that, we\u2019d already had Lucy Brady come and join our business. She is a Senior Vice President of BCG; 20 years experience in helping global businesses develop growth strategies; so, ideally placed to seamlessly fit into that. So, it\u2019s an important balance; it\u2019s something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the UK when we were transitioning from probably a McDonald\u2019s only management team to one I felt had the right combination. And getting that balance right now is critical. And I am really excited to be into next year with the team that\u2019s sharp and ready to go ahead.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy: If you could just share a little bit more on the macro thoughts with what you are seeing, not just in China and the Asian regions and the U.S. but also Europe, just a little bit more on where you are seeing the strength in the four core markets?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, sure, absolutely. Really it\u2019s a fascinating time to be running international business, it really. Because if you speak to the team in France for example who have led so much for our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they\u2019re now facing really -- not an unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France but the different dynamics and given some of the situation and the security, terror situations they faced there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. Tourism, which has always been a substantial part of this fuel of the economy in France has really softened. And you see it in the hotel bookings and you can see impacted in certainly the more tourist areas where it\u2019s the Southern France or Paris within our business where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. But you\u2019re also seeing effect of the way that consumers live their lives, French consumers. So, there is a slight reticence to go into high density tourist areas because they\u2019re slightly concerned at environment. Now, I think some of those things are temporary and some of the things maybe slightly more permanent. But it certainly means our management teams in France having to be much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to a market like Spain where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in, youth unemployment up at 25% for example, so we have just gently slowed down the new store opening there and also focused our efforts and our investment on existing store portfolio. And I\u2019m delighted with the progress that market\u2019s made as it\u2019s built its momentum, is returning to grow through the second half of this year and the outlook looks very confident. UK is probably a well and -- an often spoken story. I think its 42 consecutive quarters of growth now and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So, I won\u2019t say too much more about that. But then you can go internationally across to Asia. China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the teams are adapting to the variations that they have to experience, both getting in consumer sentiment and the broader economy is admirable. As they are seeing, just as one example, they now have a substantial part of their business is the delivery business. And not just -- originally we set up and established our own McDonald\u2019s delivery service and that proved to be very successful. We\u2019re now integrating into third party delivery providers and that has way further accelerated our momentum in business and customer satisfaction, as more people are getting used to ordering and eating at home. So, we are seeing different trends around the world. And the one thing that\u2019s particularly beneficial to us now is as we remove some of the layers in our business, the visibility we have into what\u2019s going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets. And part of the advantage of having Chris in this position now, he spent his first year travelling around the world, both with myself, with other senior leaders and on his own facing these markets, seeing what\u2019s going on, understanding the big levers of our business and is now perfectly placed to help take over the U.S. business. \nChris Stent: Next question is Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Just had a question with respect to the context of pricing of 3.5, and obviously that gap that you noted, so historic level between food-at-home. I wonder can you talk about how does that translate into the promotional environment that you\u2019re seeing now and perhaps going forward. I think this time last year, everyone was sort of getting into the 499 meal offerings and trying to promote heavily but obviously your margins are strong and you\u2019re taking price. Should this be a read that the promotional environment though still existing is not as heavy maybe or going forward?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. I\u2019d say you can see out there, there is still some promotional offerings certainly around the industry. I think all of us certainly including us would like to see kind of just a stable platform where you can -- that\u2019s why we put McPick 2 in. The idea is to have an ongoing value platform that customers can count on and not have to come up with some discounted promotion, if you will, every now and then. On the pricing side, to your point, right now we\u2019re a little bit ahead of food-away-from-home and we certainly experienced very favorable margins here in the U.S. in the third quarter. Some of that is the timing of when we take pricing. So, if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There is about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that would be in last year\u2019s fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing down and maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food-at-home, which you mentioned is -- the food-at-home is extremely low right now. Thanks. \nSteve Easterbrook: Just to add to that, what I would say is we\u2019re trying to get the right balance, that is we build our plans. But we don\u2019t want to have a price-led strategy; we want to have an experience-led strategy of which value is a critical component. And our teams, as we look over the immediate term through 2017 through the three-year plan, that is the fundamental basis of how we\u2019re building our plan. Yes, value but we don\u2019t want to be price-led. And we can see some in the sector being drawn that way; that\u2019s not the place we really want to have.\nChris Stent: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W Baird. \nDavid Tarantino: Steve, my question is on the U.S. business. I think you mentioned several times about the short-term headwind associated with cycling, the launch of All Day Breakfast. And while I understand you want to focus on the long-term, I think investors are very focused on how you might lap that initiative this quarter and next quarter. So, I was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to share how the business is trending currently or how you think Q4 and Q1 might play out given that very unusual comparison.\nSteve Easterbrook: As you say David, it is an unusual comparison. So, we entered this period with our eyes wide open. And as we say, look, we are mindful of where the performance spiked last year. I can assure you, we\u2019re not building tactical plans to try and hit a comp in a given month or a given quarter. We are building for the long-term and not getting shaken up our strategy. So, we will still fight for market share at local level. We\u2019re going to leverage All Day Breakfast through quarter four into quarter one. We\u2019ve got some exciting promotional activity in quarter one that we\u2019re looking forward to. So, we\u2019re not sitting on our hands here but at the same-time nor are we going to get drawn into a year-on-year comp strategy at all. So that\u2019s the visibility I\u2019m happy and open to share with you, but not getting into predicting comps.\nChris Stent: Next question\u2019s from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Steve, I know you said in the U.S. you\u2019re going to update us later on your progress on the Experience of the Future, but do you think it\u2019s going to be a meaningful or could be a meaningful driver to the U.S. business in 2017? And what are the things that need to happen in order to implement that? I know remodels for example is a key part of that. So, where are you now on remodels, have you been sort of remodeling quietly behind the scenes and maybe some update on what needs to happen in order for Experience of the Future to be rolled out fully?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, thanks John. I say it\u2019s starting to make the contribution in 2017. I mean the reality is we would see this as something like a three-year program, which is exactly what we\u2019re seeing through the markets like UK, Canada, Australia. These are rolling programs and actually give us growth upon growth upon growth. For the UK for example, they\u2019re already almost 40% converted to the entire Experience of the Future, which is introducing the technology along with the hospitality as well as the food elements. And therefore, their visibility on year-on-year growth of next two to three years looks pretty strong. In the U.S., we\u2019re certainly early in that cycle. In terms of modernized restaurants, it\u2019s just over 50% of the U.S. state is modernized; we\u2019ve got some work to do to complete that. And then of course within that we want to layer on top of the other elements, the broader [ph] elements, consumer facing elements of Experience of the Future, integrating that into the self order kiosk, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their food. So, we expect to start seeing that wrapped up through 2017 and literally the minute you convert the restaurant, we see a sales lift. So, yes, it\u2019ll be a contributor, but we\u2019ll probably be getting that full rate through 2018 and 2019 as well, which I think is a very strong program. One of the things we have benefited from is, we\u2019ve learnt a lot of what works, also one or two things that don\u2019t work in the markets that we nearly adopted, Australia, Canada for example. So, we can bring that best practice into the U.S, make sure it\u2019s locally relevant and then go hard at it. So, we\u2019re really excited. The barrier to it is really -- is just a collective will to invest. I mean, there is an investment element to it over an operator level helping the company, and certainly from a company perspective we\u2019re allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to co-invest with them and we\u2019re really -- at the moment the U.S. cash flows are all time high. That means their ability to invest never have been greater. So,. I think we\u2019re in a good place.\nChris Stent: Next question\u2019s from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Hi, thank you. I have a follow-up and then a separate question. One, just on the pricing, the follow-up is you\u2019re talking about rolling off. To the extent that you know kind of what elasticity looks like in your business, is there any sense that maybe by allowing to roll off your traffic could accelerate in the sense that traffic has been negative and maybe the higher prices is a contributor to that so that we could see that composition change a little based on what you know about your customers? And then my second point is -- second question is about the unit growth, taking it down. Is that because you\u2019re intentionally steering more capital to existing unitary models, or is there something in the markets that you\u2019re seeing that would suggest kind of a slower pace of unit growth is appropriate? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Sara. Let me hit both of those. The pricing, it\u2019s a fair point. As I mentioned, there is a lot of elements of pricing. What we try and balance is certainly restaurant profitability with continuing to grow guest counts. So, we\u2019ve talked about our main focus being growing guest count certainly in the U.S. And again, as I mentioned, the pricing is a little bit of a timing issue. So, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see that come down a little bit, which could help then accelerate some of the guest count growth. Regarding unit growth, we brought it down by around 100. I think we had a 1,000, about a 1,000 last quarter; now, we said about 900. It\u2019s a little bit in various markets, a few in China, few in Spain, nothing of significance I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about, certainly in places like Australia and the UK where we\u2019re implementing Experience of the Future seeing good sales lifts from those investments; we continue to reinvest in those types of investments. So, you saw the capital didn\u2019t come down; it was really a reallocation of a little bit of the new store openings to some of that reinvestment to continue to grow sales.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: Good morning. One of your larger QSR/coffee peers reiterated guidance the other day and they really kind of implied stable or positive fourth quarter comp trends. So, I\u2019m wondering if this is a case for the QSR industry overall. What does it seem like to your team? It seemed relatively better and if so why? And then, part B, if I may. How do you want us to think about\u2026\nSteve Easterbrook: Nicole, sorry to interrupt. Could you just repeat that? The line is muffled. You talk about a competitor with\u2026\nNicole Miller Regan: I\u2019m so sorry. Let me pick up my headset.\nSteve Easterbrook: Please repeat that. It would be great.\nNicole Miller Regan: I apologize. So, one of your larger QSR/copy peers reiterated guidance earlier this week implying positive or just stable fourth quarter comp trends. And I\u2019m wondering if you and your team feel like this is the case for the QSR industry overall. And if things do seem relatively better for the entire industry, why now? And then part B, as analysts, how do you want us to think about and model that in comparison to your very difficult U.S. comp comparison in the prior year? Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: I\u2019ll take the first one. So, we plan our business to grow on a global basis. So, growth is fundamental, both clearly at the global level but also at a local level with our owner operators. Our rich history of continuing to grow this business over 60 odd years through changes in -- societal changes as well as competitive environments as well as different economic backgrounds, we have proven to be pretty a resilient business. So, certainly as we go through quarter four and into quarter one, yes, we\u2019re planning to grow our business. Now, there\u2019s going to be ebbs and flows within the global business on where those pockets of success happen and that is why our geographic diversification is one of our great advantages. But we\u2019re planning to grow our like-for-like sales and we see that as being the life of our business as we look out over the medium to long term as well.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer: Just shifting to the capital structure. What was your rent-adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter? And theoretically, where could you guys take it and still maintain that investment grade credit rating?\nChris Stent: Jeff, this is Chris, I\u2019ll be happy to give that back to you offline. We don\u2019t have those numbers in front of us.\nKevin Ozan: I guess what I would say is we are kind of -- we\u2019re certainly in the middle of BBB+ right now, have a little bit of room but not a lot of room, and we\u2019re committed to remaining at that BBB+ rating. And so as we look at any further debt addition, we keep in mind kind of wanting to stay at that existing credit rating. So, that\u2019s our intent certainly.\nChris Stent: Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley: Two questions, both kind of follow-ups on previous discussions. I\u2019m curious, in your point of view that gap in the food-at-home inflation versus food away-from-normal inflation is part -- or the reason why restaurant sales -- and I\u2019m talking industry-wide, not on McDonald\u2019s are relatively soft. And then secondly going back to the questions on the U.S. future of the experience. If you have the same sheet of what elements you would try to include in that and is the U.S. in particular challenged because the driving [ph] percentages is so high in absolute terms or relative to other markets?\nSteve Easterbrook: The gap clearly plays a role but it\u2019s not the reason for the broader softening, it\u2019s not the sole reason. So, I think it is an element. But when you are lower average check business like we are, I don\u2019t think that magnifies out the same as if we were a mid scale dining or fine end dining. So, yes it\u2019s probably in the mix but it\u2019s certainly doesn\u2019t explain. I think there are broader macroeconomic issues of consumer confidence and just uncertainty of wage increases, the slight squeeze on discretionary spend with gas prices aging back up and healthcare costs going back up. So, I think those are sort of things that we see affecting customers and basically the spare cash they have in their pocket. Regarding Experience of the Future, I mean one of the great learns we\u2019ve had and particularly with launching so aggressively in Australia over year and a half ago which the main food element was something we described as create your taste and that was an in-store only premium food offering. Now, it worked great but we wanted to find a way that we could take that to our entire customer base. So, with Aussie team we worked on solutions now, what we can now bring. So, we believe there would be food elements customizing premium quality food that we can deliver through both the drive through and in-store. And I think that\u2019s one of the benefits we have of getting those early adopter, in our case going aggressive, learn, bring it back over and localize it and launch it. And so we believe we have a good solution for that. \nChris Stent: Last question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Just a couple of follow-ups, if I may, firstly on G&A, I think that Kevin made the comment regarding that you guys have recently -- you brought in some third party consultants that were helping you to thoroughly evaluate the organizational structure. I wondered, do you think there might be some opportunity beyond the previously announced $500 million with some of that work that\u2019s recently coming in? And then secondly, if I may, there have been a lot of conversations on and off regarding your capital budget. What is the direction of CapEx for the business, new units and existing units over 2017 and 2018, if there is an initial direction we can get?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, thanks John. Let\u2019s start with the G&A. As you mentioned, we\u2019ve been spending some time certainly as an organization looking through, I\u2019ll say everything, our organization structure, our layers, the way we\u2019ve designed structures et cetera. And for now, what we\u2019ve agreed to is that we\u2019re going and reducing our G&A by just $500 million net. That still allows us to continue investing where we believe we need to, to continue to grow the business. So, we\u2019re very conscious of making sure that we\u2019ve got the right investment levels to be able to strategically still invest in the business. Might there be some opportunity beyond the 500, I guess, I\u2019d say we\u2019re not going to stop looking or stop having the discipline in the organization to continue managing the business appropriately. But there has been a lot of change in the organization in the near-term. And our belief is that for us right now, this is the right level for us to focus on in the near-term. I wouldn\u2019t say that that means we stop and then never kind of manage the business effectively going forward but for us right now the commitment is for the 500. Regarding capital, right now, as you know we\u2019re right around $2 billion. What you may see in the near-term is as we convert some of these countries to development of licensees where we free up some of that capital, some of that maybe redeployed to the U.S. to spend on this Experience of the Future investment that Steve was talking about. So, you could see some reallocation of that capital in the next few years that would effectively keep our capital envelope relatively similar to what it is today. And then once that\u2019s complete, it\u2019s likely to go down after that. But in the near-term, we may reallocate some of the capital that we\u2019ve freed up to spending to accelerate that U.S. Experience of the Future investment.\nChris Stent: We\u2019re at the top of the hour, so I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Chris and again thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize our focus on giving people more reasons to visit McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019re committed to creating customer noticeable change across our business especially in the areas of food, experience and value and it\u2019s making a difference. Customer perceptions of McDonald\u2019s are improving and so is our performance. And moving in the right direction, we know there is much more work to do as begin to transition from our turnaround plan to mindset focused on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long-term. I am encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made and I\u2019m excited about the opportunities ahead as we begin to reinsert McDonald\u2019s as the global leader of the IEO industry. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call.

And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, acted with greater urgency, and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking four consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments and franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets. More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies, and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies. As we enter 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top-line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects slower growth, due, in part, to challenging conditions in several countries. I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S., our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and averaged 130 basis points for the quarter, despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus on All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including MONOPOLY, contributed to top-line performance. In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segment and, in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent: commitment to running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees. Early last year, we put the customer back at the center of everything we're doing. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S., the leadership moves we've made around sustainability, and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future. Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choice in the All Day Breakfast menu. Those with muffin sandwiches on the menu asked for biscuits. Those with biscuit sandwiches on the menu asked for muffins. We listened, worked through the operational challenges, and this fall, we'll begin offering muffins, biscuits and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants. Under the broader food quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership stance of sustainability because it's the right thing to do for our business, society and the world at large. In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranchers and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to fork. Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to us. At the same time, Experience of the Future is quickly coming to light in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. The U.K. is almost 40%, and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just three months ago. Customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. The most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in seven of our nine largest markets. In the U.S., we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to a recent YouGov report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's was ranked fourth most improved brand across all brands measured, and the most improved within QSR. We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We're also being smarter about our structure and resources and prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This includes putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customers and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately accelerating growth. At the same time, we're further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look at how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern, progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs. These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's. With that context, let's now turn to performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for the second quarter increased 1.8%. Whilst modestly positive, this growth was not as strong as the last two quarters. This is due, in part, to the recent softening of the IEO industry, which experienced minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May at only 40 basis points. The All Day Breakfast platform continues to contribute to top-line momentums that draw new customers into our restaurants and creates additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. It's also delivering bottom-line growth, with restaurant-level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. Franchisees are excited about the platform and its future growth potential. And the next phase of All Day Breakfast, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%. With food, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu. And we're being more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our new brand campaign called The Simpler the Better, which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have even more news to share in the coming weeks. Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. We're tapping into the flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value-seeking customers, which is increasingly important given softer IEO industry trends. Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers into our restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways to increase the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost. Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6%, with four of the top five markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception, with results that were relatively flat. Whilst the recent Brexit vote has created uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe, our business remains strong. And we are confident in our ability to manage through the change. Having operated in these markets for over 40 years, we're accustomed to dealing with external challenges and believe we are well-positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business. And, in fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers, such as the relaunch of Big Flavour Wraps, and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May. In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter. The performance of All Day Breakfast in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S., driving incremental sales while providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms like Experience of the Future and McCaf\u00e9. We're introducing new customizable flavors and ingredients supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers. Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With a heavy concentration of price conscious customers, value remains a critical priority. The new pricing structure we rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for \u20ac5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines. Macroeconomic challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunities at the premium end through engaging promotions and limited time offers, including the recent New York Street Food Event, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps. In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite a challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO and, more specifically, from Chinese QSRs, whilst undertaking meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in this important market. In an effort to give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors, to offer added convenience to Chinese customers. In Russia, comparable sales remain positive, driven, in part, by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple dayparts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward, given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power. I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, ones that customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Whilst we've come a long way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. For now, we remain focused on continuing to win within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategic path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion informal eating out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders. Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016, and outline the recent progress we've made against our financial initiatives. Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter, for the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins. For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter. Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results, as margins rose 150 basis points, with China leading the overall improvement. In the U.S., company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter, as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity costs more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, the improvement in second quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business. Moving on to G&A, our second quarter expenses increased 2% in constant currencies, due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance, as well as costs associated with our biennial owner/operator convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased. Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated, due to our sponsorship of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million, or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions. Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of non-cash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives, as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impacts. As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we had strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies. Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs, in the U.S., commodity costs declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity costs to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segments' full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year. Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations. And our suppliers also hedge a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near-term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices. While we are benefiting from favorable commodity costs around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand, to drive guest counts. In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with food away from home inflation of 2.6%. Given the widening gap between food at home and food away from home inflation in the U.S., we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food at home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while food away from home inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1.5% to 2%. Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit and our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the U.K. And, as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote. While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near-term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation. We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income and the Eurozone collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only, because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results, due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons. It was just over a year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business, from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix, to our capital structure and the strategic allocation of our resources around the world. We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. In the past six quarters, we've refranchised about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to-date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to-date. It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and the benefits that will be realized by moving to a more heavily franchised system for McDonald's globally. From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A goal as part of our third quarter earnings update. Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our three-year $30 billion cash returned to shareholders target. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion, or 57 million shares. In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter. Through June 2016, the cumulative cash returned under our three-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year. We've delivered positive results over the last four quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but, most importantly, from top-line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things. We're also making good progress on all of the actions we outlined last year. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline, and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we're making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth. Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Instructions] The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, one on the U.S. industry and one on your guys own U.S. business; on the industry, your outperformance against the industry this quarter is very similar to last quarter, which suggests the entire industry saw a huge deceleration, around 350 basis points. So what do you believe, sitting in your seat looking at the United States, what are the two largest drivers of the softening in the IEO trend? And do you see it continuing into the rest of the year? And secondly, on your own business, when you look at lapping All Day Breakfast in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the ability to sustain positive trends here as you lap that? Is extending the All Day Breakfast menu enough or are there more initiatives required in your mind? Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Brian. So on the first one, on the industry, well, clearly, it's been fairly well documented on the consumer slowdown across most consumer segments, to be honest with you, through the second quarter. And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it was important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and fought for market share. We're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor are we letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers. I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food away from home and food at home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers. So the food at home, there's value to be had for families there, whereas eating out, there is a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it. I think generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge their financial security going forward, you know, whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. And when people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts to prevail and they start to hold back on spend. And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly, but also we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations. And if people are reining in their spend across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well. So we're mindful of it. It just means we've got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt and make sure that we're building compelling plans in the short-term as well as the long. In terms of sustaining trends, well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter basis. We are mindful of the short-term, but we have our eye aligned (28:19) on the long-term. And we believe we've got a number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained long-term growth here in the U.S. Our value platform, we continue to learn. So for a McPick 2 for $5, for example, we had our second national campaign in May. And we learned more about it in terms of the items we could have within the bundle and how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets where we're testing out the Experience of the Future in the U.S., where we're making a significant and exciting rollout program in Florida and certainly within New York as well, which we believe the results there may mirror what we're seeing elsewhere in our other major markets, provide a very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S. as well. So mindful of the short-term, we're going to fight for share, but also, we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long-term.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, you had some comments about improving consumer perceptions in most of your major markets. Does that include the U.S. and what measures are getting better? Where does the opportunity still remain to improve? And then which of your initiatives do you think are really going to help you get where you want to get with your brand, with the result for, I would imagine, being traffic getting better from here? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David. Yes, so if I was to be U.S. specific, I referenced earlier the YouGov latest poll on brand perceptions. We've made really encouraging progress. And I believe that's because as well as trying to drive the business in the immediate term, we've also made the investments and the commitments around food, food quality, sustainability, the employment proposition, where not only did we move pay for our hourly paid start, but also a far broader enhanced range of benefits, including training and education opportunities for them. And with a brand like McDonald's, everything you do communicates. So the better you move on every single consumer touch point, then the broader halo on the brand starts to improve. So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain that momentum, but it's nice to see it being recognized by consumers. Part of that comes out of the basics of running better restaurants, and we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make the progress. So we spoke in the past about an attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru. Our accuracy has improved. The quality of the food perception has improved. Friendliness improved, all by the order of about 6%, including speed of services as well. So I believe the day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives that immediate satisfaction. In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes, and the items in the restaurants as well as the perception, better explaining what's in our food, where it comes from. And so that's where The Simpler the Better campaign starts to focus. It chronicles the big meaningful moves we have made and, I believe, signals the direction of travel for us going forward. And, as I say, I'm not going to disclose anything more about it, but there will be more news to come, which we know is going to be powerful on the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well. The other element that I'm excited to introduce, that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S. because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future, which is a fundamentally different experience for the customer. And a lot of that does involve technology as well as the service experience as well. Any of the interactions that customers have with the experience of McDonald's, whether it's coming into the dining area or going through the drive-thru, how can we take out the long value-added processes and just made it a smoother, more enjoyable and easier experience for customers? So the introduction on of self-order kiosks, the development of our mobile app so you could order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant; it takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise and just makes it a smoother experience for customers. We are seeing a good pickup in sales as we roll this out across the U.K., Canada, Australia, and early days, but also in Germany as well. So we know we're on to something. We know customers respond well, and certainly it breathes new life into our restaurants and into the brand.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. If you could give us a little bit more insight into how you're looking at the structural margins, especially in the U.S., as you've regained some of your lost footing, what do you think are realistic margin expansion targets? Assuming more modest same-store sales in the flat to up 2% or if you were able to reaccelerate to 2% or greater, how should we really be thinking about it, given the current labor and COGS outlook?\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, thanks, Brett. It's Kevin. You saw in second quarter this year, we were able to actually grow margins 30 basis points in the U.S. with the 1.8% comp sales, which we were certainly pleased about. As you know, long-term margins are a top-line game for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins, but what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more favorable this quarter, our management of what we call controllable costs, both on the food side and the labor side, was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurant. Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in a normal inflationary environment. That probably hasn't changed much, and there certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from David Tarantino of Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. I wanted to come back, Steve, to the commentary around speed of service. I think you mentioned that that had improved, at least from a perception standpoint, but could you give an update on where you are on that front? And it seems like such an important factor when you think about how much of the business goes through the drive-thru. What are the keys to improving that going forward?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, David. You're absolutely right. I mean, the reality is the customer experience is critical in just our underlying business momentum. Speed of service has predominantly improved, largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we've enhanced the training, some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru. And you may have heard me talk about a program we called Ask, Ask, Tell, which is a way of really ensuring we both took and then delivered the right order day-in, day-out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates far smoother. We also made significant changes to the merchandising in the drive-thru, with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards, which, again, just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right. So I think there's a lot of work that's gone on. The real devil in the detail, down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams who are collecting the orders can gather the right items. But also, there's a lot of work we're doing in the future where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do some of that heavy lifting for us. So whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker posts, all the way through to ordering ahead via either the Internet or the app. Now, we have elements of this going on around the world. I'm not sure we're going to pull them all together here in one market, but we are going to take those learnings and see how the customer responds to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in and that will help, again, further enhance speed of service. I mean, all the way to we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. I mean, if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go and on to curbside. And therefore, when you think about it, you've got one satisfied customer who is ordering and collecting and paying exactly how they want. That's also one fewer car going through the drive-thru, so the existing drive-thru lane runs smoother. So we're looking at this from a number of different directions. I'm definitely not underestimating the day-to-day operation improvements the chains have done so far, but also we're looking at innovation in the future to try and keep it smoother and easier for customers, and just easier for our teams to get right.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Wondering how do you benefit, or not, from the Summer Olympics. And is there anything you want us to be aware of in the third quarter relating to that for modeling purposes? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, for us, there's a brand association with sports. We've been a long-term sponsor of the Olympics. So we have some fun and engaging initiatives going on, particularly in and around Rio and working with our partners down there, Arcos Dorados. I wouldn't say there's anything material that's going to impact our business trends. We'll have some fun with it in certain markets where there's promotional activity, where there's tie-ins and allows consumers to get a little closer to it. And you can expect to see us with a little piece of that across the U.S. as well, but I wouldn't see it materially impacting our business one way or the other. It's just a brand reinforcement that we're committed to, to global sport to supporting participation at local community levels, just like we are with football or soccer around the world with our FIFA partnership.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Given the 3% pricing in the U.S. this quarter, which is at the midpoint of the food away from home inflation outlook, how should we think about your willingness to let price roll off? Steve, you called out the differential between food at home and away from home creating pressure on the top line. And if I can sneak one more in there, Steve, you called it out in your prepared remarks, but there was no mention in the release of the MONOPOLY promotion in April and the Angry Birds promotion in May. So is it fair to categorize June as the strongest month of the quarter for U.S. same-store sales?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I will speak to a couple and Kevin may want to add to that as well. When we look at the average check increases, so kind of the gap between top-line sales and our guest count momentum, I mean, clearly, price is a differentiator, but so is also the product mix, the bundling of items within each purchase. And one thing I would want to say is that when we have offers redeemed through the global mobile app, we see an average check increase. When we see breakfast items bought during the main daypart, we also see an average check increase. So part of it is not just price-driven, it's actually product mix and bundling-driven. I don't particularly want to talk to the monthly trends, because we've got away from that, so I don't think, honestly, that's very valuable. I guess what I would say across the quarter is there wasn't really a deeply meaningful trend one way or the other. We consistently performed and we consistently outperformed the market. And if I look at the competitive gap week-to-week-to-week, which clearly we do, we had a pretty consistent outperformance right across the 13-week period. I don't know if, Kevin, you want to add anything to that.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll talk about some the pricing stuff you mentioned, Andrew. Related to kind of what rolls off, I guess what I would say is in the second quarter, we had some pricing from the prior year that rolled off and we didn't replace all of that. And you can probably expect similar for the rest of this year, again, partly because of that widening gap between food at home and food away from home inflation. So we're certainly keeping a close eye on both of those metrics because it's really important for us to focus on maintaining and growing guest counts.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sorry, I'm just coming back on MONOPOLY and Angry Birds result. I think it's really important for a business like ours and a brand like ours to create energy and engagement amongst our customers on multiple fronts. And clearly, standing for everyday value is important, certainly, but also, so is some fun and some engagement. And that's the role that games like MONOPOLY play or meaningful promotions like Angry Birds. It just provides some excitement and some buzz around the brand. And we do have a, I would say, competitive advantage that we are able to attract many of the best partners in the world because of our size and scale matching theirs. And like a recent example of the work in Japan, so I'm thinking with Pok\u00e9mon Go is a great example, where clearly we're a preferred partner and it's been a fun program. It's doing great things for the business. And customers respond to that, both at a day-to-day level in the restaurants, but actually, they recognize that we're a leadership brand and we attract leadership partners.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just back on the U.S. sales, you're still in an early phase of a turnaround. So one could argue that your gap to the industry should still be widening and it didn't this quarter. I wonder \u2013 just a couple of questions, one is, do you think the change from a Dollar Menu to the bundled value had any adverse impact on transactions and the way people think about the brand? And clearly, as you're very well aware of, the fourth quarter and early 2017 comparisons are more difficult. Do you think just adding to the breakfast all day menu is sufficient to lap those or are there other things you're thinking about that are more profound, you just don't want to talk about today? I think you mentioned something about loyalty. Is this the time that a loyalty program would fit into the marketing plan, for example?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, John. I think on value, is there a trade-off in transactions having moved away from the Dollar Menu? I think there is, yeah, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we wanted to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition in our restaurants. And that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And, again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong, is because it's grounded in what customers tell us is most important for them, which is choice and flexibility. We're not locking them into a certain price point, nor are we locking them into a certain selection of bundled items. So we believe that choice and flexibility is right for our customers and gives us flexibility and new news as we return to these programs across a year. Sometimes, they'll be at a national level. If it's not national, it'll be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for $5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops are being worked on their variations of particularly the McPick 2 for $2 or at a value price point. So we're continuing to learn and evolve that. But is there a transaction trade-off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We planned for that, but we still believe we have an everyday value proposition. And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops (45:12) on an ongoing basis, whether it's a $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the offers we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads of that. We've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the offers and the frequency card on there are driving over the (45:33) interaction. In terms of quarter four, clearly, we know the, if you like, the quarterly cycles we're on. We believe the enhancement to All Day Breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as does running better restaurants, as does reinforcing value. The team is certainly working on other activities. There is nothing in particular to share today, but I would say that we are playing the long game here. We're mindful of the quarters, but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe we're getting the right fundamental foundations and platforms in place to reinforce the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price-led program, which we had been somewhat joined to in the past. And we believe that the brand-enhancing long-term perspective, as long as we're winning the short-term market share fight, is a good combination for us.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Terrence Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you. You mentioned Pok\u00e9mon Go in Japan; just curious if there are opportunities besides Japan for Pok\u00e9mon Go. And then, wanted to ask as you lap last summer's wage increases in the U.S., what do you expect to see in wage inflation in the U.S. kind of in the back half of the year versus what you've seen in the first half of the year?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Joe, I'll take the first one, because I'm more knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon than I am about the detailed financials. I'll let Kevin deal with that one. So our relationship with Niantic really has been driven by our Japanese team. It's a global phenomenon, clearly, and they're working really hard to roll it across a whole bunch of different markets around the world with, again, great success. We'll keep talking to any leadership partners around the world, so nothing else to say, no other speculation to add to it, but we're certainly enjoying what it's doing for our business in Japan at the moment.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Regarding labor costs, minimum wage, et cetera, you should expect to see kind of not a big bang like you would've seen in 2015 related to one significant effort, if you will, to raise wages at one time. We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country. One of the pluses that we've seen from the efforts that we've taken, as Steve mentioned, both on the wage side as well as the benefit side, is that our crew turnover is down year-over-year. So we've seen some benefits on the labor availability side, if you will, from the actions we've taken. I think it's fair to say labor pressures will likely continue in a lot of countries around the world, including the U.S., but there aren't any specific plans to have a one point in time where we significantly increase.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question's from Jason West of Credit Suisse.\nJason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks. Just a tactical question and then a bigger-picture question, just on the pricing that you guys quote, the 3% in the U.S., is that net of the discount that you're offering on McPick 2, like say, when it's a 2 for $5 for things like Big Macs or is that just the gross pricing? And then just bigger picture, I guess, as you guys step back and look at the impact that McPick 2 has had on the business and All Day Breakfast, do you get a feeling that there's initial trial there that's difficult to sustain, which is somewhat the way it sounds on the outside a little bit, or are you not really seeing that sort of dynamic playing out as much? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the second one, Jason. So McPick 2 and All Day Breakfast, they have both followed pretty much the curve that we would've expected. I mean, whenever you launch anything and put national support behind it, you have a launch volume. And then you kind of settle into a more ongoing run rate. I've got to say we're pretty happy with how both of those have played out. And they have continued into the out quarters, if you like. From the All Day Breakfast launch in October of 2015, we're now almost lapping that, that time and it's continuing to give us strong incremental sales, strong incremental margin and cash flows and incremental visits as well, and the same with McPick 2. So I think these are now platforms that are just going to continue to work hard for us at that kind of steady-state ongoing level.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Jason, that 3% is a gross price increase.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question's from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just two follow-ups to what was mentioned earlier, one, Steve, you mentioned the market share gains and it seems like it's stabilized in the U.S. relative to last quarter. I'm just wondering whether you could talk a little bit about the largest international markets; whether you'd say based on whether you're looking at food at home or the informal eating out market, just however you look at it, trying to see whether there's any big winners or losers in your largest international markets. And then the other follow-up was just for Kevin. You mentioned the return of cash, and I think we're all well versed in the bump in leverage and the big bump in the repo that you've done over the last 12 months. But with this three-year period being close to done, and now as we look out over the next, presumably, three-year period, is there any reason, at least directionally, to assume any meaningful change in that $30 billion, whether up or down? Or maybe what metrics would lead you to make that decision? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jeff. So when we look at market share certainly across our major markets, we look at both IEO, but also then QSR. And depending on your competitive set, they have different merits, depending on which country you're looking at. But if I was to take IEO, we have made strong gains, I would say, across in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And we feel good about our position within the broader marketplace. Even more encouraging is in the nearing competition, the QSR market share, where we have made some substantial gains in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And I think as part of the turnaround, we have really focused on making sure that we win in the most immediate competitive set we are. This is part of the modern, progressive burger company ambition, which is make sure we're strong and dominant in our immediate sector. And then we start to take IEO share as we broaden the experience. I believe the Experience of the Future will have us fight into an increasingly strong position in the broader IEO. In the immediate term, it was getting the basics of the business right so we win QSR market share. And I've shared over a number of these calls and meetings we've had about some of the successes in Australia and Canada, for instance, but the customer experience is noticeably different than it was three to four years ago, both from the designs of the restaurant, the introduction of technology, the substantially enhanced front-of-house hospitality that we now offer, all the way through to providing more options to customize your food by self-order kiosks, for example, in the dining areas. And now we're extending that to table service. So if a customer was to walk in now versus two, three, four years ago, it would be a noticeably different experience. And I believe that's both winning QSR share and IEO share. And those are the sort of ideas that with the new structure we have, we're looking to move and are moving very, very quickly between markets.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then, Jeff, related to your cash return question, as you indicate, obviously, over the last year or so, we've had an adjustment of our capital structure by taking out some more leverage and returning that via share buyback to shareholders. Going forward, we haven't stated any target, but certainly our overall capital allocation philosophy hasn't changed, which means you should expect that over the long-term, we would return all free cash flow to shareholders, that's a combination of dividends and share repurchase, while still maintaining kind of that BBB+ credit rating, which is where we are right now.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Just a question on your longer-term operating income margin opportunity, so looks like your guidance points to franchise restaurant ownership moving to I think it's almost 95% by the end of 2018. I think you stand at roughly 83% today. You've seen dramatic margin expansion in the past, following some of these aggressive refranchising efforts. Going back and looking at \u2013 the model looks like in 2007 and in 2008, you did see some really, really impressive margin expansion, again, I think after you developmentally licensed and refranchised more than a couple thousand restaurants. So with that precedent, what operating income margin level \u2013 and again, I realize you're not going to give me a specific number or even a tight range, but when you guys move to a 95% franchise mix, how different do you think the operating income margin of McDonald's will look in 2018 as compared to what it looks like today?\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Jeff, it's Kevin. Couple things, one, I believe we expect to be 93% by the end of 2018, with 95% longer-term. So I just want to make sure everyone gets that. As you know, the way it works when we refranchise, we'll pick up franchise margin dollars. Effectively, we're swapping company-operated margin dollars for franchise margin dollars, and certainly then spending less G&A and capital to generate those franchise margin dollars. So as you state, that was certainly accretive to operating margin back historically when we've done that. We would expect similar \u2013 that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward, based on the activity. As you indicate, we're certainly not going to throw a number out there, but, generally, one of the main reasons we're doing that is because of the stability of both the cash flows and the operating performance going forward. So we've got a stable revenue stream that we'll collect and a predictable model that allows us to manage the business pretty effectively. Certainly on a free cash flow basis, you should expect that it would be accretive, because, as I said, we're generating more income, more cash flow, and not spending as much capital.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say just as a broader philosophy on the fundamentals of not just the turnaround plan, but our growth strategy beyond, Jeff, is that with the ownership strategy, this is around us being able to focus our time and our attention and our resource on the areas and the markets that make the largest contribution and also our talent. So we're going to place our talent in the areas that drive growth. We can place our capital in the markets where the returns are stronger and, at the same time, liberate one of the fundamental DNAs at McDonald's, which is to have 100-plus of our 120 markets owned and operated by franchisees and developmental licensees, because they are closer to the customer and closer to their local culture. So we believe we're going to get that balance right, which will certainly enhance our efficiency and effectiveness, not just as an operating business and drive long-term growth, but also our financial returns as well.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: The last question's from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you very much. And maybe a little bit of a follow-up or maybe good timing from the previous question, it does look like you guys are choosing developmental licensing, perhaps even over conventional franchising as we kind of read what we read in the press and how you've discussed the business. So with that being said, there were a few different references to G&A, I think, by both Steve and Kevin in your prepared remarks. Maybe there's some commentary coming on the third quarter. The first G&A cut announced, I think, was $300 million and then it was $200 million. Is your mindset that there could be another type of G&A tranche to come out, perhaps as significant as the first two that you've discussed? And secondly, as we start to focus on free cash flow, especially as we get into 2018, are you prepared to help us think about what the long-term CapEx of a kind of a post-refranchised McDonald's would look like?\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, John. Let me talk about the whole deal of developmental licensee versus conventional. So as we talked about last year, we effectively took a restaurant-by-restaurant and market-by-market approach to look at kind of the best way of franchising in our mind. And what you'll see is, and generally in our major significant mature markets, that's the U.S. and International Lead markets, you'll see more of the conventional franchising, which is what we do in the U.S. So you would have seen some more conventional franchising certainly in this quarter and there will likely be further franchising like that. In countries, certainly in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a little bit more volatile from an economic and political standpoint and/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe we're willing to put in capital right now, those situations, you will likely see us using that developmental license model that we've used successfully for many years in a lot of the countries. All of the transactions that we have planned right now were taken into consideration when we came up with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will, in and of themselves, drive further G&A reductions. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to look for efficiencies and run the business in a disciplined manner, but you shouldn't expect that because we complete a franchising transaction or anything along those lines that that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: We're near the top of the hour, so I'll turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing comments.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. And, again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I want to re-emphasize our focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we're doing, from the food we cook to the conveniences we offer, to the service we provide. That mindset ignited our turnaround last year and continues to guide our decision-making. We're moving the right direction, with four quarters of growth, with growth across all four segments in each quarter. But there is more work to do. And that's precisely why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. I'm encouraged by the way we're creating a better McDonald's and excited about the opportunities ahead. And I'm confident we will continue to aggressively take actions to strengthen our business and reassert our leadership position as the modern, progressive burger company in the global IEO industry. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We began 2016 in a manner consistent with how we ended 2015, as a more focused, aligned system with positive momentum in every business segment. I'm pleased to report that this momentum continued through first quarter 2016, with meaningful gains in both top and bottom-line performance. Global comparable sales increased 6.2%, and earnings per share grew 26% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of the comparison against prior year's strategic charges. The momentum we're experiencing is broad-based. All business segments are contributing to our growth. The actions we are taking are driving noticeable change for our customers and giving them more reasons to visit McDonald's. This is reflected not only in our financial performance, but also in the recent market share growth we're seeing across most of our major markets. Whilst our first quarter comparable sales performance benefited from tailwinds that will not necessarily recur in future quarters, such as leap day, strong sales recovery in Japan, and milder weather across the winter, our underlying operating performance is solid and consistent with our expectations when we developed our 2016 plans. This success is driven, in large part, by our singular focus on executing the turnaround plan. Grounded in putting customers back at the heart of everything we do, we're committed to running great restaurants and elevating all aspects of the McDonald's experience. Our biennial convention last week came at an opportune time. Nearly 14,000 owner/operators, suppliers, and employees from around the world gathered to galvanize around our biggest business opportunities: our food; our people; the customer experience; and our brands. It was energizing to see everyone motivated to act and united around the opportunities we are seizing, as we strive to be recognized as a modern, progressive burger company by our customers. When we align behind fewer bigger priorities, we activate our size and scale advantages like no other company in our industry. Let's turn now to segment performance and the specific initiatives underway across our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.4%. All Day Breakfast continues to provide customers with new reasons to visit McDonald's to enjoy their favorite breakfast food and beverages in the morning and lunch and throughout the day. In addition, All Day Breakfast fills a price gap on the menu. And customers are responding by trading up or adding All Day Breakfast items to their orders. Whilst we're no longer in the launch phase, this platform remains a significant contributor to top-line results, and we're already looking at ways to extend it in the future in response to customers' feedback. U.S. is also taking steps to fortify its appeal to value-conscious customers. The McPick 2 platform provides customers with more choices at compelling price points, and it gives us added flexibility at both national and local levels. We tested two versions of the platform in the first quarter: McPick 2 for $2 in January; and McPick 2 for $5 in March. The offerings were designed to target different customers, and both resonated well. Beyond All Day Breakfast and value, we're pursuing additional opportunities to fuel momentum. This includes further enhancements of our core menu items to: improve quality perceptions of our food; sustaining our heightened focus on operations, especially in our drive-thrus, to improve accuracy and speed of service; and additional opportunities to simplify our menu and the overall restaurant experience for our customers and crew. Customers in the U.S. are noticing a difference. We experienced a 6% improvement in our overall customer satisfaction scores compared to the first quarter of last year. And we are gaining share relative to the QSR sandwich segment, with a positive comparable sales gap of 140 basis points for the quarter. Let's turn now to the International Lead segment. First quarter comparable sales grew 5.2%, with the top five markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter, though Germany was relatively flat. The U.K., Australia, and Canada continue their strong track records of positive comparable sales performance. In fact, first quarter marked the U.K.'s 40th consecutive quarter of growth. These markets share similar characteristics that underlie their success. This includes: the execution of customer-centric brands spanning multiple initiatives, such as menu, value, marketing and promotions; service enhancements, as they make meaningful progress toward Experience of the Future; and strong alignment with their franchisees. The success we're having is evident not only in our financial results, but also in the market share gains we're experiencing in these highly competitive markets. Our market leadership teams are engaging more frequently than ever to share ideas, discuss common opportunities, and ultimately develop holistic plans to fuel momentum into the future. France continued to outperform the branded IEO market, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, including rising unemployment rates and ongoing public safety concerns. Value remains a priority. And the relaunch of the McFirst platform in March, combined with additional value options including new proteins and product lines, helped strengthen our value proposition. We complemented these efforts with successful limited-time offers at the premium end, including the Grand Premium with a new chicken fillet, and the new American Winter food events, to enhance our relevancy and appeal to customers in this important market. Guest counts remain negative in Germany. In an effort to strengthen our appeal to price-conscious consumers, we launched a new pricing structure in February. Our goal is to offer the right value equation across the entire menu. Initial results were in line with expectations, but it was not sufficient to stem overall guest count declines. In the High Growth segments, first quarter comparable sales increased 3.6%, as China and Russia continue to recover from prior-year challenges. China delivered strong comparable sales growth of 7.2%. The market also made significant gains in market share, despite persistently challenging macroeconomic conditions. Performance was driven by successful execution of multiple initiatives, including new products like chicken snacks, alongside growth across the delivery, value, and breakfast platforms. Solid comparable sales performance in Russia reflects ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, we expect macroeconomic uncertainties and decreasing consumer purchasing power to remain headwinds through the rest of 2016. I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Japan, where comparable sales increased 27%, due, in part, to: recovery from the prior year impact of the 2014 supplier issue; the successful marketing promotions, like the (9:14), along with strong value offers, reflect the success the market is having as it executes its revitalization plan and regains brand trust. I am pleased with the progress we've made in the 13 months since I became CEO. We are making improvements that our customers are noticing to serve hotter, fresher food with improved overall service experience. We are returning many of our critical markets to growth in terms of sales, guest counts, and market share. And we're increasing profitability both for the company and our franchisees, whose cash flow's approaching all-time highs in many of our major markets. We've taken bold decisive actions that are delivering sustainable benefits. Our decision last year to close underperforming restaurants in several markets, including China, have directly contributed to improved financial performance. In addition, the improvements we made to our compensation and benefits package for our employees in U.S. company-operated restaurants, along with expanding Archways To Opportunity, a program which is now providing tuition assistance to more than 5,000 eligible employees at both company-operated and franchise restaurants, have resulted in lower crew turnover and higher customer satisfaction scores. At the same time, we're applying forensic analytics across all aspects of our businesses, both from an external and internal viewpoint, to identify and pursue opportunities for longer-term growth. This includes innovation in markets around the world. For example, with menu, we're innovating to address customers' changing demands at every price tier. This includes work being done at the premium end of the menu, such as the new Signature Collection, which was piloted in the UK in the first quarter, as well as enhancements to our value offer, like the new McPick 2 platform in the U.S. We're also innovating around service. As we roll out self-order kiosks, table service, and the mobile app, we're providing customers with more choice and flexibility, as we make progress toward McDonald's Experience of the Future. We're evaluating opportunities to enhance the experience for restaurant employees, too. For example, the U.S. and the UK are working together to develop a new teaching approach for shift managers. This new training module extends beyond core operations education into leadership competencies, to help shift managers learn how to coach and motivate crew to deliver a better customer experience. As we learn from local market innovations, we're tapping into the power of our new segment operating structure to more quickly share knowledge and scale the most successful ideas across markets. The rollout of All Day Breakfast in Australia in the first quarter was a testament to our ability to move winning plays quickly between markets. We're also continuing to pursue opportunities to grow the business through new restaurant openings. In fact, last month, we opened our first restaurant in Kazakhstan, our 120th market. We received an overwhelming amount of enthusiasm and support from the local community. By the end of the first day, we'd sold over 2,000 Big Macs. I'm confident in the actions we're taking. Our turnaround plan is working and, for this reason, the plan will remain our framework for at least two more quarters. Later this year, we will evolve to a longer-term strategic plan to further sustain our momentum. In closing, I am encouraged by the progress we have made and energized by the opportunities ahead. Across our entire system, we are more in line than ever on running great restaurants each and every day and on providing our customers with what is most important to them: hot, fresh food; fast, friendly service; and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonald's. The actions we've taken are working. Customers are noting a difference and are choosing McDonald's more often. As we look to the future, we will continue to execute against our turnaround plan in the near-term, while we begin to lay a foundation for generating sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned, our business turnaround is taking hold. The positive momentum and solid improvements in our underlying business performance over the last three quarters serve as proof points of our progress. Today, I'd like to review the major components of our first quarter operating results, provide a few updates on our outlook for 2016, and discuss recent developments related to our financial strategies. Let's start with a high-level look at first quarter performance. Results for the quarter benefited from stronger operating performance, with global operating income up nearly $400 million, or 28%; 33% in constant currencies. The most significant contributions came from sales-driven growth in franchise margins, lead by the U.S. and the International Lead markets and the sales recovery in Japan that Steve mentioned, which contributed to higher other operating income. These items accounted for almost $200 million, or about half of our operating income growth for the quarter. The other half of our growth was driven by comparison against the $195 million in strategic charges taken last year related to our restructuring and refranchising initiatives. Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results, with margins up 110 basis points. The High Growth markets, in particular, China, lead the margin improvement. In the U.S., while company-operated margins declined 110 basis points for the quarter, solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity costs helped offset most of the impact from our prior-year decision to increase crew wages and benefits effective July 1, 2015. Second quarter of 2016 will be the last quarter the U.S. company-operated margins will be negatively impacted by these wage comparisons. Similar to the past three quarters, we expect existing labor pressures to negatively impact U.S. company-operated margins by 350 to 400 basis points in second quarter. While we're on the topic of company-operated margins, I'd like to provide updates on a few of the key margin inputs, including menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S., first quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 3%, compared with food away from home inflation of around 2.7%. We continue to keep a close eye on food away from home inflation, which is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the full year. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 2% to 3%. From a global pricing standpoint, we're planning for more limited pricing power in those markets that are experiencing low inflation to ensure that we maintain our focus on growing guest counts. Moving to commodity costs, in the U.S., commodity costs were down 3% during the first quarter, and are expected to decline 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. For the International Lead segment, commodity costs were relatively flat for the quarter, and are expected to remain relatively flat for the year. Turning now to foreign currencies, more recently, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most of the world's other major foreign currencies. At current rates, currency translation is expected to be less of a headwind on full-year results, and is now estimated to negatively impact second quarter by $0.02 to $0.04, and full-year by $0.05 to $0.07. As always, please take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout the year. Next, I'd like to provide updates on our refranchising, cash return to shareholders and G&A targets. Last year, we committed to strategically evaluating ownership structures, with the goal of becoming around 95% franchised over the long-term. In the past five quarters, we've refranchised about 700 restaurants, including over 200 in the first quarter this year. The large majority of these were sold to existing conventional franchisees. As part of the forensic review of our ownership structures and strategic allocation of resources around the world, during the first quarter, we also initiated new refranchising activities in several markets in Asia and Europe. In Asia, we announced plans to further unlock growth potential with emphasis on three markets in our High Growth segment, China, Korea, and Hong Kong. These markets collectively operate almost 2,900 restaurants, of which about 70% are company-owned. Given the relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential in these markets, our intent is to identify strategic partners, with skills and expertise that will enhance our competitive advantages and bring additional capital resources, to further invest in and grow the business. We remain optimistic about the future of our McDonald's brand in Asia, with plans to add at least 1,500 restaurants across China, Hong Kong, and Korea over the next five years. In Europe, we're working to identify a strategic partner in the Nordic markets, which include about 460 restaurants, the vast majority of which are operated by independent franchisees. We believe opportunities exist in the Nordic Region, and that a sale to a local partner can result in an optimal structure for both McDonald's and the future success of these markets. Due to the unique nature and size of many of these markets and the importance of finding the right partners, it's important to keep in mind that these transactions may take 12 to 18 months to complete. At the end of 2015, we also started to lay groundwork to complete the final year of our three-year $30 billion cash return to shareholders target. In February, we initiated a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program in conjunction with this target. This program was a significant component of the $3.7 billion in shares repurchased during the quarter. Our ability to pursue a more aggressive share repurchase pace during the first quarter was supported by the financing completed in December last year. Looking ahead, we expect further debt additions in the coming months, as we opportunistically take advantage of favorable interest rates while maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating. From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017. Over the course of the last year, we've brought greater discipline and focus to the business, and we've made meaningful and tangible progress against our turnaround plans. Although we have come a long way, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve the goals that we've established. As we move through 2016, we are keenly focused on maintaining the positive momentum we've created. This momentum is a direct result of a renewed focus on our customers and running great restaurants. We will stay the course and complete the critical steps of our turnaround to position the business for success as we chart our strategic long-term path forward. We are mindful of both the opportunities and challenges ahead. Overall, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results, due to uneven prior-year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in certain key markets. In addition, we recognize that opportunities still exist to further strengthen and generate strong guest traffic in some of our key markets around the world. In closing, the financial results achieved are a testament to the collective efforts of our franchisees, suppliers and employees to reset our business. We are on our way toward becoming a modern and progressive burger company. Like Steve, I was energized by our worldwide convention last week, as I saw first-hand the tremendous focus, discipline and passion of our unique system. I am confident that we can continue to deliver on the progress that we've already made to enhance long-term shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. The first question is from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust.\nJake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the call. Steve, in the last couple press releases, you've mentioned positive same-store sales or positive momentum in each segment in the current quarter. It wasn't in this release. Should we be reading something into that? If you could clarify, that'd be great.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, thank you, Jake, and that was very conscious from us. I felt in the early stages of the turnaround, it was important for us to demonstrate confidence that the actions we were taking were resonating. And to provide that shorter-term guidance, I thought helped to reinforce that we were beginning to get on the move. Now, we're two to three quarters in, I'm confident to say that the turnaround is taking hold, and you've seen the results we've delivered. And, as a result, customers are responding to the changes we're making, and momentum is a very powerful word in our business. And, as a result, we're confident on executing our plans and don't actually see it as being necessary to offer shorter-term guidance.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.\nBrian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to focus on the U.S. business as kind of two questions; you've obviously done an extraordinary job reigniting the sales growth. Your gap against the industry in the fourth quarter was close to 300 basis points, and it was about half that this quarter. And it's still an amazing trend, but is the difference between the two quarters just really the fact that you got a bit more initial strength that came with launching All Day Breakfast, and now this outperformance gap you're seeing is a little bit more of a reasonable expectation that we should have going forward? And the quick follow-up to that is, as we look past this first quarter into the future, do you think the stickiness that comes with regaining momentum with your customer base is enough or do you really feel the need that you got to take on much more dramatic operational risks like the All Day Breakfast that can pay off pretty big going forward? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Brian. In terms of the gap, I think that was a fair assessment. I mean, we clearly came out of the tracks hard with All Day Breakfast. It exceeded our expectations through the launch phase, and then hit a more settled rate. Frankly, it's still exceeding our expectations through the settled stage as well. So we're incredibly encouraged. Frankly, maintaining that positive gap is important to me. The absolute magnitude quarter-to-quarter, I'm less concerned about, as long as we're taking share and customers are turning in our doors rather than others, then I'm confident that we're delivering the right plans. In terms of stickiness, something that gives me a great degree of confidence in the way that the U.S. team, the operator leadership and our own leadership team have built in the plans is the success is not being based on tactics. We're establishing foundations of growth. And if I were just to give you four of them currently in play, and clearly we're going to be working on more, the operational improvement, honestly, I would celebrate that as much as All Day Breakfast. We are focusing on getting the basics right in the restaurant. And the team are really focused and they're delivering well, and customers are telling us that. So I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get the nuts and bolts right for the 20 million-odd customers every day. The investment that the U.S. team, operators and company have made through food and food quality is being recognized by customers. So whether it's the announcement we're moving to cage-free eggs, or removal of antibiotics harmful to human health from the poultry supply chain, whether it's the deep attention to detail on the Quarter Pounder beef patty and toasting of buns, the investment in the quality is getting recognized by customers. And that's valuable. That's long-term at well. Then you've got All Day Breakfast, which has been clearly a very strong catalyst for momentum, which is wonderful. We're in that nice situation now where we're challenging ourselves to how much more can we do. Customers are asking us for more. We're looking at that very carefully to see whether that's a platform that not only is sustaining, but can actually grow. And then, as we spoke about through this quarter, we have struggled to find the right value platform over the last year or two. We believe through the McPick 2 platform as a whole, we have the flexibility at both national and local level, such that we can offer compelling value at different price points, different times of year, and maybe slightly different offers in different parts of the country depending on the consumer set, but we believe that could be a platform that continue to offer growth opportunity and drive customers in. That's what we've got in play now. And clearly, there are other things that we're looking at around new product development and also around investing in our restaurants in what we're calling the Experience of the Future. Now, I won't carry on, because I want to get through some more questions, but the point I'm really trying iterate is these are platforms of growth which give me confidence in the stickiness of our momentum, and we have no plans to ease up, I can assure you.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.\nKeith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Coming off the operator convention, and considering the comments that much of the refranchising thus far was to existing franchisees, could you talk about your philosophy for that franchising? In other words, the five to seven unit averages in the U.S. and maybe how that plays out internationally, could we see consolidation here? Is five to seven the right number or maybe a few bigger core anchor folks? Could there be benefits to that? What is your philosophy towards those franchisees going forward? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a great question, Keith. I mean, part of what we have worked hard across this last year, in order to firm up our plans moving forward, some of the big, strategic plans is with our new structure now, we have much better visibility into our top 14, 15 markets. And frankly, there is not a common philosophy across those, because every market's in a different position. So if we're to make the strategic choices we have in China and Asia, for example, or up into the Scandinavian markets, that's because we have got very forensic and we think that's in the long-term best interests of the markets and of our long-term growth and that ownership model. Your question more to the U.S., I'm sensing is more to the U.S., where we have typically been five to seven. The philosophy that is critical to us is never losing that entrepreneurial spirit, and the owner/operators being engaged in their local communities. Now, that can be done at a 50 restaurant level. That can be done at five restaurant level. That can be done at a one restaurant level. So, to us, the importance is having the right partnership to be operated with the right mindset. Could we see consolidation? We could do a little. Does that give us fewer, stronger operators and a stronger balance sheet and their ability to invest in scale? It could do. But, at the same time, we're also introducing new franchisees to the system, because they come in with new ideas and new energy and keep us fresh. We also see it through the Next Generation Programs we have, where sons or daughters of existing franchisees want to enter the business, and that brings us new ideas and a fresh energy. So the underlying philosophy remains the same. The execution market-by-market, I believe we've got much more, much deeper meaningful thought to it that we can address this market-by-market. I think it will serve us well into the long-term.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I guess you guys mentioned before the National Value Platform coming up later this year will incorporate multiple price points, multiple menu items. So I'm curious about the learnings you gathered from the two McPick 2 tests. You mentioned that there was several different customer bases that they targeted. And just kind of curious what you derived from these promotions to help shape the National Value Platform for later this year? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no, it's fair question, Andrew. So, I guess when I say there were different customer groups, when you're looking at McPick 2 for $2, you are typically addressing the value-conscious, the most value-conscious customers, so I guess people who are looking for a deal. And that is important, and particularly important at certain times of year. So if you're coming out of the Christmas period, and it's been a high-spend period, a dollar here and a dollar there matters to consumers through January in particular, for example. So that deal for the value-conscious consumer at that particular time at a national level resonated well. If you look at a 2 for $5 for example, it's a different construct. You're looking at people who may be going in, maybe there's two people going in, and they start to construct a meal around that deal and feel they're getting value that way, so slightly different customer group. It could be the same customer may care for both, but there could be a different group as well. And part of what we're learning is at what level do we want to deploy this at a national level, and use that national marketing muscle. And how much do we want to allow the flexibility at the regional level, because we've got these re-energized regions, 23 of them, around the U.S. and they want to bring it to life. But maybe the menu mix in that deal could be different in the Southwest of the country than it would be in the Northeast. And I think that flexibility, knowing your consumer group, knowing your competitive group, knowing what that value price is, allows us to unleash on the power of our regional marketing muscle. So you will see us dial it up and down, national and local, but the one thing you will always see, there will always be value at McDonald's.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, guys. Another question on the U.S., we have been hearing from some of the casual diners, in particular, that QSR (33:34) platform, such as your 2 for $5, have been taking share at lunch. So, I'm curious if you have any color on daypart grows in the U.S. And secondarily, if you feel like there is more room to innovate around that $4 to $5 price point to make McDonald's even more of a meal solution versus, maybe, historically, some of that focus on the $1 to $2 price points in driving value traffic?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I'll certainly kick off, and maybe Kevin can come in and relieve me. So, we're seeing success across all dayparts. So, one of the very reassuring elements of All Day Breakfast was that whilst we clearly added incremental visits and incremental spend across rest of day, our breakfast business has also prospered as well. So, that's very strong. In terms of innovating at different price points, I mean, that's absolutely what we're trying to do, whether it's through breakfast, filling that little price gap between the entry level and whether it's EVM or the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder Cheese, six-nugget level. So we continue to innovate. I mean, Kevin may want to offer a little more on this.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The only additional color I'd add is in first quarter, all dayparts were positive, contributing to that comp sales growth. So the lunch daypart is definitely providing the largest impact, but every single daypart was positive, so it isn't being driven by one specific daypart or anything along those lines. The advantage, from our standpoint, is to see the broad-based growth across the entire day and evening, and so that's what gives us confidence going forward.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And in terms of where our growth is coming from, just to close off that final piece, I mean, the reality is we're growing share and opening that gap now in the QSR sandwich segment, but when we get 14,000 restaurants on a roll, customers tend to come from quite a few places. So I'm not surprised if other people are feeling the impacts of it, but at the moment, we want to win our home games. We want to win the QSR segment, and we want to get back to a leadership position there.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from David Tarantino of Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning, and congrats on a great start to the year. My question's about the U.S. business. And, in particular, I was wondering if you could share some detail on what the guest count trend you saw in Q1 was, perhaps if you could also factor in the trading day in that response. And then, you mentioned towards the end of the prepared remarks, that you want to drive better guest counts as this year progresses in key markets. And I assume that that includes the U.S., so if you could talk about kind of what you think the keys are to drive better guest counts in the U.S., whether it's value or speed of service, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, so I can say for the U.S. guest counts, we're positive for the quarter. If we were to net out the leap day, guest counts were positive for the quarter. So that is a further sign of momentum returning to the U.S. business. In terms of the comment regarding guest count in key markets around the world, around the world, we have strong value platforms in many of our major markets. So this is not a price-driven guest count discussion. This is around what can we do to enhance the experience, such that customers enjoy sufficiently they just come back more often, or we attract lapsed customers back or new customers to the business. But the first point of check is, is our value platform right? We're working on that for example in Germany. I acknowledged that. We haven't quite got it right yet, so we'll continue to firm that up. In many of our other markets, our desire to grow guest count, which is the ultimate signal of strength of the business, is more around enhancing the broader experience. So, as I say, this is not price-led. This is how can we make the visit to McDonald's more convenient, more fun, more engaging, such that when you come to make those decisions of where you're going to eat, more people just turn our way than anywhere else. So it's a much more holistic desire, but ultimately guest count is the lifeblood of our business. And I'd like to see greater strength there, but I'm very happy with the trends we're seeing.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. John?\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hear me okay?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, we got you now. Hi, John.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, good. Good, sorry. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the refranchising that you guys talked about in Asia specifically, maybe just put some numbers to it. So those three markets you've identified, China, Hong Kong, and Korea, what's the total operating profit in those collectively? What's the capital spending in those markets collectively? As you think about a refranchising transaction, I assume it's dilutive at some level. And do you think of it as holistically, it's accretive once you put buybacks in place, some high-level thoughts about how the mechanics of that might work in the early days.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So in those three markets, as I mentioned, it's about 2,900 restaurants, about 70% company-owned. We don't break out capital by markets, so I won't get into total capital really to that, but fair to say that, as you know, we're growing substantially in places like China and Korea. So it's got a meaningful amount of capital that we're spending on growing there. And the thinking is that if we can find the right partners there, we want to make sure we find the right strategic partner that has complementary skills and expertise and also has sufficient capital to unlock the growth potential there. So the way we think about it is if someone else can use their resources to grow the business, we'll participate in that growth through an increased royalty, and effectively reduce G&A and capital that right now we're spending related to those countries.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, just to add to what Kevin said, the underlying message that I was very keen to communicate, which is why I went out to China to visit the team and make the announcement, this is about accelerating growth. So our run rate in China, for example, is typically around 250 restaurant openings per year. We want to find the right strategic partner that meets and most likely exceeds that. So this is about accelerating into the market opportunity. And as we sit here with our more appropriate fiscal discipline across our business, we have a lot of demands for our capital, and a lot of choices where we want to invest our G&A. And therefore, we're just making that resource allocation discussion. China is a wonderful opportunity. We're going to continue to participate in it. And our desire and expectation is to accelerate our growth there.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering how you view the path to improved restaurant margins. As we look at the spreadsheet here, we're seeing a few hundred basis points lower margins, roughly, or more, than where you were at peak back in 2010, in spite of the fact that food margins will likely be closer to that level. So it is really coming through leverage throughout the rest of the restaurant P&L, and the refranchising will cause some company margin gains, but just thinking across the system, is it going to take a lot of ADB growth to approach the past peaks, or is there other efficiency productivity stuff that you're working on that can help those margins? Thanks.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, David. I guess I'd say, as we both well know, margins are certainly a top-line game for us. We need positive comp sales to help grow margins. Specifically related to the U.S., now that we're seeing certainly stronger comp sales, that will help our margins going forward. As I mentioned, in the second quarter this year, well, beginning in third quarter, we'll begin to lap the additional labor costs related to crew wages and benefits. So that will help from a comparison standpoint. But historically, we've always said that in a normal inflationary environment, we need about a 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins. Nothing structurally has changed in our business to change that on a long-term basis. A little inflation wouldn't hurt from a pricing standpoint, so we have to be careful with commodity costs where they are, but I think we feel pretty good about margins going forward, as long as we can maintain our growth in comparable sales there.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: David, the way I look at the U.S., I think, given the investment costs that they absorbed around the crew wages and benefits, I think they turned in a very, very strong performance in terms of their operating margin. Sales growth clearly supports it. Lower turnover of crew has made us more efficient and effective in the restaurants. The commodity outlook is increasingly favorable, as we just highlighted, so I think that now we're nine months into the cycle. After 12 months, I think we'll see a nice step-up in company-operated margins. And do take a look at International Lead markets as well. Again, strong performance as they go through. First of all, top-line growth is the primary driver. As they go through their refranchising plans as well, you'll see continued strength in the operating margin there as well. So I feel we have lined up this business to deliver long-term, strong margin returns for all stakeholders.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Joe Buckley at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Steve, when you said about the operational improvements in the U.S., are there specific things, like staffing or speed of service, that kind of drive it? Are there one or two, two or three things that you can point to on the operational improvement side? And then just a question of the High Growth markets, could you talk a little bit more about the performance of the various markets in that category?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, okay. Thanks, Joe. So operational improvement in the U.S., I mean, it is so multi-faceted, that I could take hours. I'd love to, because I just love what they're doing. So simply put, we have made the experience easier for customers and easier for crew, and easier to get right. So, they have had a particular focus, having identified that the core frustration for customers was accuracy through the drive-thru, which then impacts service times. So, they put a number of initiatives in place, such as simplified menu boards, new crew training procedures, as we've described as Ask, Ask, Tell, just another way that we help ensure we get the accuracy right through the whole customer experience, from ordering through pay through collect. But we're into the real details. We're into the font size on the printers, the receipts. Actually, it's easier to spot the special requests, for example, or the special orders. So I can't even tell you how detailed the team has got to help our restaurant teams get it right more often. And ultimately, the beneficiary is the customer on this. And they playing it back through all the customer metrics we have, whether it's through mystery shoppers, through our own operational grading standards, we are seeing these effects take place. And honestly, that is the primary driver of customer satisfaction, getting it right, hot, fresh food and friendly service. In terms of High Growth, so I tend to call out China and Russia, just because of the scale and the potential of those markets, but we had great performance out of Netherlands, great performance out of Hong Kong, great performance out of Poland, great performance out of Korea through the quarter. And these aren't one-offs. So, I appreciate the question, because it gives us a chance to demonstrate how broad the momentum in this business is. And it's not limited just to the High Growth markets. I mean, if I just look at: Western Europe as a whole, growing strongly; Central Europe, growing strongly; Middle East, strong growth through the Middle East; Latin America, there is turbulence, as there often is in there, but overall strong growth; Asia, Australasia, as well as North America; and calling out Canada as well as the U.S. So, we are seeing a lot of strong momentum. Is it perfect? No. Are there markets we still have work to do? Absolutely, yes. And we're never satisfied, but part of the confidence we have that the turnaround is taking hold is because of the broad-based growth we're experiencing.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Jason West at Credit Suisse.\nJason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks. Obviously, things are going very well here. And just to kind of nitpick a little bit, I guess, if you look at the U.S. comps on a two-year or three-year basis, particularly backing out leap day, they're not extremely robust quite yet. And just wondering your thoughts around the ability to continue to accelerate the business on a two-year basis, and maybe if there's anything out there in the U.S. that you think is holding back the customer from coming more regularly or showing a little bit more strength there as you move forward and the compares start to get a little tougher? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, I mean, so absolutely early stage of the turnaround, Jason. So absolutely, we don't think we've cracked it. What we have done, we're beginning to get back and grow on that two-year basis. We look at it on a week-to-week basis, I can assure you, on a month-to-month basis, and a quarter-to-quarter basis. And our two-year lifeline is moving into positive territory. And that's at the early stage of the turnaround. As we build out our plans for further sustained growth, clearly we want to see that trend continue. I'm not sure there is much more to say on that. I mean, it's, yeah, early stages, but I tell you what, we've got it back and some. So, there is two-year growth across each of the months across the first quarter, which I feel good about. And that is one of the measures we look at. So that complacency doesn't set in. We have a restless energy here. We've just got going and a lot of the theme around the biennial convention last week was around accelerating with momentum, and not just sitting tight with the momentum. So, that's how we're galvanizing ourselves. That's how we're challenging ourselves. And these platforms that the U.S. has introduced, I'm confident will maintain that stickiness. But we want to layer further platforms on top of that, which is exactly the ingredients of success through that kind of 2003, 2004 through to 2010, 2011 period was we were layering platforms of growth on top of each other that are complementary and customer-driven. And we have no plans to let up, that's for sure.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. I just wondered if you could give us just a follow-up on the G&A question there. I think you said $500 million savings realized by the end of 2017. I think the G&A in this current quarter seemed a little bit higher than maybe some had modeled. I wondered if you can give us a little bit greater clarity on that cadence throughout, even just as far as how much of that $500 million should be realized through 2016, if you can give us some sort of color on that.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, thanks, Matt. Regarding the G&A, so let me first talk about first quarter, which was up just compared to last year, basically because of higher incentive compensation than last year. So a lot of that is driven by last year's lack of incentive comp, if you will, in the first quarter as much as this year's incentive comp that's in there. Looking forward, both to 2016 and beyond, couple things, we achieved about $75 million of our total savings in 2015, and built within that 1% to 2% guidance is another about $75 million in 2016. Now, there are two swing factors, if you will, that could impact the actual reported G&A this year. And I'm talking on a constant currency basis, so obviously currency also impacts it. But when we think about the targets, we exclude currency, so the actual numbers you'll see reported may be different because of currency impact. But ignoring that, the other two swing factors, if you will, are, one, incentive comp, where if you think about 2014, we had very little, if you will, incentive comp as a company. 2015, we got back to a more normal. So you can get a big swing from one year to the next on incentive comp. But all of that is driven by business performance, so we'll only have the incentive comp obviously if we're driving business performance. But that could swing things, plus or minus, that down 1% to 2% guidance. The other swing is the timing of some of these large refranchising transactions. When we do our plans at the beginning of the year, we're effectively estimating when those will occur. And they become very complex as we get into these transactions. And so to exactly pinpoint the timing of when those occur becomes really difficult. So it's possible that something that we may have thought was going to happen at the end of 2016 could potentially slip to the beginning of 2017. And that may impact the timing of some of our G&A savings, but, other than that, we're on track for the $500 million. We're still completely confident in the $500 million by the end of 2017. And it becomes just a timing issue between 2016 and 2017.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: You guys moved off of the 2 for $5 national marketing window. I think that was late March, and moved to MONOPOLY. Did you see a big chunk of your franchisees choose to stay with that 2 for $5 promotion? And I guess the follow-up question would be, if so, is there any insight to be had as it relates to the 2 for $5's impact on transaction growth, average check, whatever you want to point to, operating profit per transaction, anything like that on the read-through perspective?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So a good number of the franchisees did stick with the 2 for $5. They felt it was a really strong contributor to their March, which it was, from a top-line, from a guest count, and from a bottom-line perspective. What we're also seeing now is our local co-ops now having really good discussions around the McPick 2 for $2, 2 for $5, and which windows to execute. So I don't have a general response for you, but I would say that the conversation around value at a regional level and a co-op level is where to dial up 2 for $5, where to dial up the 2 for $2, what time of year, and to be complementary with whatever else is going on. So, for example, if you can collect the MONOPOLY tokens on certain items, then reinforcing that through the value, just drives further trial of the MONOPOLY promotion, for example. So it's complementary. So, again, the local teams are working on that. And, as I say, you can certainly expect to see them up to platform feature through the rest of this year, either at a national or local level.\nKevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The only other thing I'd say about the 2 for $5 is, we did see some trade-up and definitely a higher average check with that platform. And you can see from the margin performance in the U.S., kind of overall for the quarter, that these value platforms support good margins, I'll say, too. So it's not just discounting products at low margins. We still can realize good margins with that platform.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: Looks like we have time from one more question from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the U.S. quick service category, I mean, obviously, your rebound has been strong, and yet others seem to be holding onto their strong results as well, and I think you've demonstrated that with the fact that the gap between yourself and the industry has narrowed pretty meaningfully. So I'm wondering whether that has surprised you, how you'd kind of assess maybe the quick service category, where the share's maybe coming from, it seems like everyone's got pretty compelling value, so that would be a big driver taking share from elsewhere. And being that you just spoke to franchisees last week, I'm just wondering, as an aside, I'm sure they sound pretty good. But what's the greatest push-back you're hearing today, now that it seems like you have the momentum? Where are they kind of coming back at you asking for some change or frustration of any kind? Just wondering what their sentiment is. Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of the share discussion, no surprise at all, to be honest. It's an incredibly competitive category. It is around the world. So here in the U.S., I think nine of our 11 major markets grew share in the last three months, which I think is a very strong support. The two that didn't are fully aware of that and addressing that in the near-term. The U.S. performance, just continuing outperformance paints us as a winner. So and then you either win or you lose market share. If we keep gaining, then typically when a business of our scale gains within our sector, we do pretty well. So there's no surprise. It will continue to ebb and flow, but as long as we keep gaining share, then I will remain very, very satisfied in the achievements. In terms of the owner/operator mood from last week, the wonderful challenge we have now is holding the operators back. I mean, there's a lot of enthusiasm to be part of the future plans that we've laid out. And we started to give them a sneak peek of what that longer-term strategy should look like, and there's a lot of excitement around it. There's investment that goes along with that, so there's things we still need to work through. And that's why we're having these test markets and test regions to further explore and learn. But, at the moment, the enthusiasm is great. And we're just trying to keep people focused in channels, and making sure that we are helping them build their businesses for long-term profitably as well as our own. So in terms of anything on the negative side, it was difficult to find much last week, to be honest. And that's not always been the case. I'm not going to assume it will always be the case in the future. But I think the alignment with the owner/operators is as strong as I can remember it. And it gives me just further confidence that we're on the right track, and we're all winning together on this one.\nChris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations: We're near the top of the hour, so I'll turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing comments.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Chris. And thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I do want to re-emphasize the strong alignment, as I just mentioned, we have across the system, on running great restaurants and elevating all aspects of the customer experience. The actions we've taken to serve our guests hotter, fresher food with lots of friendly service and a contemporary restaurant experience, and at the value of McDonald's, are working. Customers are noticing a difference and they're coming to McDonald's more often. This is reflected in our first quarter financial results and in the market share gains we're experiencing in many markets around the world. We know there's still more work to do, and that's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plans for at least two more quarters. I am encouraged by the progress we have made, and I'm excited about our longer-term opportunities to strengthen our business and reassert McDonald's leadership position around the world. Thanks to all of you and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call.

And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. 2017 was a very strong year of performance for McDonald's. Our results demonstrate we successfully completed the transition from turnaround to growth. Our momentum is broad based across the McDonald's system. There are strong leadership teams in place, our business is fit for purpose and grown platforms underpinning our strategy of residential customers and markets around the world. Our top priority in 2017 was serving more customers more often and we did. We grew cash counts by 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 1.9% in the full year, with all business segments positive. This is our first full year of positive comparable cash count growth since 2012.  Comparable sales for the quarter grew 5.5% marking our 10th consecutive quarter of growth. Full year comparable sales increased 5.3%, our best performance in six years. We made significant advances with our franchise strategy in 2017 culminating with our largest developmental licensee transaction China and we reached our target of refranchising 4,000 restaurants per year ahead of schedule. Customers tell us that we are notably enhancing their McDonald's experience by being more attentive to their needs and serving hotter and fresher food. Our overall customer satisfaction surveys scores continue to improve in 2017 with most markets achieving gains across multiple elements of brand perception particularly friendly service and taste and quality of food. As a result, six of our top eight markets grew market share with the UK, Canada and Japan leading the way.  We are pleased with our progress but certainly not satisfied. There is more potential in the marketplace and in our plan and we are leveraging our considerable size and scale to unlock it. We are sharper and more focused in the way we organize bank and act and we are confident in our ability to execute with excellence to drive sustainable long-term growth. Kevin will walk you through more details about our financial performance in the fourth quarter and the full-year. \nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve. By all measures our strong performance in 2017 shows that we have momentum. Enabling us to drive our business innovate and invest in our growth so we can compete effectively in today's globally marketplace. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement in soft global markets and on top of strong prior year results.  Comp sales in guest counts were positive across all of our operating segments with overall results driven by strong performances in the U.S., the UK, Japan, Canada and China. U.S. comp sales increased 4.5% for the quarter compared with the rest of the QSR sandwich competitor set which was relatively flat.  Comp sales for the international lead segment rose 6% with positive results throughout that segment. High growth comp sales increased 4% led by China's strong performance along with positive results across the segments European markets partly offset by some near-term challenges in South Korea.  In foundational markets comps were up 8% in addition to Japan's strong performance comps were positive in each of the segment's geographic regions. I also want to mention that starting with fourth quarter 2017 comparable sales in our foundational segments and on a consolidated basis have been adjusted to exclude the impact of Venezuela due to its hyperinflationary status and the significant impact that it had on the fourth quarter. We recap the comp sales for the first three quarters of 2017 to exclude Venezuela and reflected those in the earnings release to provide comparable amount.  As we move into 2018 we will continue to direct our efforts and resources towards driving the convenience and menu innovation that will help maintain this topline momentum.  On a reported basis earnings per share for the quarter declined 40% to $0.87. These results include a onetime net tax cost of approximately $700 million for the impact of U.S. tax reform. The $700 million net cost consist of 1.2 billion of cost for the deemed repatriation of our undistributed foreign earnings partly offset by a benefit of $500 million for the revaluation of our differed tax assets and liabilities to the lower U.S. tax rate. Excluding the impact of tax reform diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.71, reflecting strong comp sales, G&A savings, a reversal of a tax valuation allowance in Japan and a 27% tax rate. This tax rate was lower than expected because of tax law changes in some countries outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter. We ended 2017 with franchise restaurant representing 92% of our total restaurant base, up from 81% three years ago. As a result, franchise margins now comprise more than 80% of our total restaurant margin dollars. For the fourth quarter franchise margin dollars increased across all segments reflecting sales driven performance and the shift to a more heavily franchise system. The franchise margin percent in the U.S. remained flat, due to higher depreciation cost related to our rollout of experience to the future. Our company operated restaurant base now consists of a little over 3,000 locations, spread across the U.S. international lead and high growth segments. The U.S. and international lead markets accounts for about 75% of the company operated margin dollars.  For fourth quarter, consolidated company operated margins improved 40 basis points primarily due to our refranchising efforts. Company operated margins in the U.S. declined 150 basis points, due to higher labor costs which reflected both wage pressures and our continued investments and deployments of our key initiatives along with higher commodity costs.  Commodity costs in the U.S. for the fourth quarter were up a little over 1.5% versus last year while our full year U.S. grocery basket increased 60 basis points. In terms of menu pricing our fourth quarter pricing was up 3% year-over-year, which was above food away from home inflation of 2.5%. The menu price increases we took in the fourth quarter were part of our broader strategic pricing reset of the menu board ahead of the launch of our $1, $2, $3 menu in early January. By the end of the first quarter this year we expect our pricing to be back below food away from home inflation. For the international lead markets commodity costs were up about 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the year, with menu prices up about 2% year-over-year. G&A for the year was down 7% in constant currencies, in line with the guidance we provided at the start of the year. I'll put these things in the perspective relative to our G&A savings target in a few minutes when I review our updated outlook for 2018. Finally, other operating income increased nearly $60 million for the quarter, primarily due to the one-time reversal of the valuation allowance in Japan that I mentioned earlier.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Kevin. As our results demonstrate, McDonald's is much more agile and able to move at a pace needed to address the needs of today's customers. With the introduction of our velocity growth plan last March we aligned and mobilizes the McDonalds system. We began actually straightaway and by the end of the year we made substantial progress in the eyes of our customers. We are serving more customers as we retain those most loyal to our brand, regain visits from those who have been coming less often, and convert the casual to committed customers. We have grown sales across the full breath of our menu with great tasting value offerings, delicious core selections such as our Big Mac and exciting premium sandwiches with a wide range of flavor profiles.  With relevant menu choices for our most price sensitive customers we have strengthened consumer perceptions of McDonald's as a place to find a tasty and affordable meal. Across the system our markets have increased the range and appeal of our food and real bundles offered everyday at compelling price points.  At [indiscernible] in France offers premium quality and a very affordable portion size. The saver menu in the UK and value picks in Canada provide a range of affordable food for snacking and adults.  In the U.S. from a big troop [ph] of $5 combined with $1 any size found in beverages provides customers the opportunity to bundle and share with incremental visits and average share in the quarter.  Programs like McPick 2 for $5 and Germany's tasty McDonald's featuring both taking core sections for EUR1.99 not only appeals to the price conscious consumer and drive incremental traffic they re-introduce customers with the great taste and quality of the food at a core of our menu.  Across the model systems we have increased a full and excitement via iconic food customers identify with our brands, the Egg McMuffin, the quarter pound of a cheese, chicken McNuggets, French fries and of course our world famous BigMac which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We have reaffirmed that customers crave this food and the core of our menu still drives growth.  Maintaining greater strength in our core menu platform has allowed us to venture further into exciting and compelling new offerings such as all-day breakfast which is satisfying customers and driving growth for McDonald's in the U.S., Australia and Canada. We also recently launched Buttermilk Crispy Tenders in the U.S. which contributed in a meaningful way to our sales performance for the quarter.  Markets that have already modernized their restaurants and have the capacity and creditability to promote premium beef and chicken sandwiches. Such as the Signature collection in the UK and Seriously Chicken in Canada which is driving brand perceptions towards higher and profitable top line growth.  [indiscernible] for our customers who access our great taste include we are providing them with greater flexibility and choice in how they order pay and are served their food.  In 2017, we left from piloting delivery with UberEATS reaching 200 restaurants in Miami, Tampa and Orlando, so offering our customers the convenience of great McDonald's food delivered from 7,000 more restaurants in 21 different countries around the world. With our market in Asia and Middle-East where we've often delivered for many years we are now delivering meals from over 10,000 restaurants more than one quarter of the systems restaurants.  Delivery orders tends up above average check size by 1.5 to 2 times and with high customer satisfaction we are seeing solid repeat business from those who try it.  During the fourth quarter delivery gained traction and emerged as a meaningful contributor to our comparable sales in several of our largest markets. In many of our markets we've scaled the experience of the future platform providing our customers a more seamless, personalized and enjoyment experience with digital menu boards, self-order kiosk, greater hospitality and a modernized look.  They are telling us they like the new McDonald's better. They are rewarding us with more frequent visits and they are spending more on average when they do.  We deployed experience the future for ALGF in about one-third of the restaurants in the McDonald's system, including nearly 3000 restaurants in the US. Customers increasingly expect to engage with brands by apps on their mobile phones and in the US alone we have over 20 million registered users of the McDonald's mobile app. We are well positioned to capitalize on that user base. ending 2017 with 20,000 restaurants around the world offering mobile order on pay. I'm proud of our team's work we achieved that milestone from a standing start in just over 10 months.  While still very early with customer usage we're encouraged by digital orders as we're seeing higher average check size and greater customer satisfaction among the customers. In particular many customers are appreciating the added convenience of curb side pickup.  Now as we're starting 2018 our focus is on executing our velocity growth plan. We will continue to provide customers an improved experience and greater choice in how they order, pay and serve their food. We have opportunities in 2018 to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order on pay. In the coming months we've initiated marketing campaigns that encourage more customers to enjoy these expanded options to engage with McDonald's. As we do we're optimistic this will contribute to the momentum of our business. With nearly 37,000 restaurants in a 120 countries McDonald's has a distinct scale advantage and significant potential. Over the course of 2017 [indiscernible] markets throughout the United States and around the world. We could see first-hand how our local teams are leveraging the benefits of being part of the larger McDonald's system and delivering on that in ways that matter most to the customers in their communities. The contemporary d\u00e9cor of well-trained crew members we saw in markets such as the UK, Canada and Poland demonstrate how successful we've been in enhancing the overall customer experience in a modernized restaurant, where customers have better experience perceptions of our brand improve sales increase and guest counts grow. In Italy we saw the results of a strong focus on the operational excellence. Customers appreciate the quick friendly service and great tasting food they receive which has dramatically changed the trajectory of our business in the market. With this accelerated growth we enjoyed its best year of sales since 2006. Cost [ph] has been a system leader in the development and evolution of self-order kiosks at the customer convenience and solutions for bottlenecks during high volume periods. During our visit last fall we saw how our French team has led in hospitality and table service across the market, to further elevate the customer experience and open up capacity. Service in the bases like these on top of their menu and value platforms have helped the market achieve an all-time high in market share. Restaurant employees in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires demonstrate an outstanding commitment to hospitality. While visiting the [indiscernible] I experienced first-hand the passion, energy of our crew and managers as they embrace [indiscernible] an innovative program creating a new service focused culture, is making a real meaningful difference for customers.  The confidence we have in the business continues to grow and I can say that our franchisee share our optimism. Buoyed by this confidence and the benefits the franchisees and the company will see as a result of U.S. tax reform we are further accelerating our investment in experience of the future in the U.S. We will bring EOTF to nearly 4,000 additional U.S. restaurants in 2018 resulting about half of our U.S. restaurants being completed by the end of this year. This is no small feat.  While our franchisees are confident about our plan for the future they also acknowledge this is a major undertaking, that will require significant investment of time, focus and leadership to execute well. And clearly it will require significant financial investment too.  Between the company and our franchisees over the next two years we will invest approximately $6 billion to transform the U.S. business. The impact will extend beyond the new equipment d\u00e9cor we are bringing to restaurants. This is an investment on our local communities as a benefit of these projects which extends construction crews and supplies. We also will continue to demonstrating our commitments to our people as we look at enhancing the training and development opportunities now offered through our Archways to Opportunity program. We did all this in partnership with our owner operators, with confidence and a firm commitment that the payoff will be a better stronger McDonald's delivering a vastly improved customer experience and sustained profitable growth. Now Kevin would share additional details about our outlook for 2018.\nKevin Ozan: With the progress we made in 2017 our business is strong heading into 2018. Over the last few quarters I have been messaging that our 2018 results will be choppy due to the refranchising of several markets in 2017 and the $100 million of depreciation benefit in china and Hong Kong in 2017, associated with the refranchising of those markets. Looking forward we expect 2018 results to be even a little more choppy, with U.S. tax reform and a new level recognition accounting standard that went into effect January 1, this year. On revenue recognition while the new accounting standard will have no impact on our cash flows the change will affect the way we recognize revenue for initial franchise fees that we received, for new restaurant openings and new franchise terms. Previously we recognized initial franchise fees when we received them, upon opening new restaurants or granting a new franchise term. Beginning in 2018 we will recognize that income over the life of the franchise term. For this year we expected this change to have a negative impact of about $50 million on our consolidated franchise revenues and franchise margins.  I talked to you about the impact of U.S. tax reform on our 2017 results and I'll spend a couple of minutes walking through how we expect the full impact of business going forward. All of this is based on available information and our current estimates which we know could change as further clarifications provided and our analogies are finalized.  From an earnings standpoint we expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be 25% to 27%, down from our historical range of 31% to 33%. Our global blended rate will be higher than the new U.S. rate due to taxes that we pay outside of the U.S. which currently average close to 30%.  From a cash flow standpoint, we expect an incremental benefit of 400 million to 500 million annually prior to any reinvestment. A few points to put this in the perspective. First, we historically have not had a large amount of cash held overseas. So, the new law will not result in us suddenly bringing back a lot of cash. Second, this incremental cash flow represents less than 10% of our historical annual operating cash flow of roughly $6 billion. Finally, we have not been capital constrained in the past, so we expect our capital allocation priorities to remain consistent with what they have been.  First, to reinvest in existing restaurants and invest in opportunities to grow the business; second, to pay dividends, and third, to repurchase our stock. Having said that we now expect to return about 24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019 which is at the high end of our previously stated target.  From a business operation standpoint, we expect our U.S. franchisees in general to also benefit from tax reform. Given the ongoing strength of our franchisees existing cash flow this benefit should enhanced our ability to invest in and execute on the velocity growth plan.  Next, I want to take a moment to review the progress we've made on our financial targets around refranchising and G&A. During 2017 we completed transactions in the Nordics, Taiwan, China and Hong-Kong which, enabled us to reach our targets to refranchise 4,000 restaurants.  We begin 2018 ready to operate under the streamlined and more heavily franchise business model that we set out to create under our turnaround plan. While we do expect to continue to refranchise some of our company owned restaurants in our major markets like the U.S. international league markets we anticipate the gains on sales of restaurants in 2018 will be down roughly 30 million to 40 million from 2017 as our refranchising activity begin to slow down.  Regarding G&A we developed the targets savings of $500 million from our base of $2.3 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through 2017 we have realized about $300 million of net savings. In order to achieve those net savings, we save significantly more than $300 million on a gross basis related to maintenance spending. And then reinvested some of those savings primarily in technology and digital. So, at the same time we saved cost overall, we've also shifted more of our remaining spend from maintenance spending to investing in activities that drive growth.  For 2018, we expect G&A to decline by 1% in constant currencies. This reflects savings from our refranchising transactions and a reset of our incentive compensation offset by one-time cost associated with our bi-annual worldwide operator convention to final year of our Olympics sponsorship and our upcoming headquarters office move, as well as continued spending in technology. We expect to fully realize our targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019. As we have become more efficient with the G&A required to run the business we will continue to invest in activities that we believe can accelerate growth. At the same time, we will continue to exercise strong financial discipline in the use of our valuable resources.  Moving on to capital, we expect to end 2017 with capital expenditures of nearly $1.9 billion. This was slightly higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the year because of currency exchange rates and because we were able to complete more EOTF projects in the US than planned, ending the year with 3000 EOTF restaurants as Steve mentioned. In 2018 we expect to spend about $2.4 billion of capital, approximately 1.5 billion or two-thirds of our capital will be dedicated to our US business, primarily focused on further acceleration of experience of the future. Of the remaining capital budget about half is earmarked for new restaurant openings and half is allocated to reinvestment as we continue to expand the experience of the future in markets outside the US. Our capital will contribute to about 250 new store openings while capital from developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute to another 750 openings for a total of a 1000 planned new restaurants. Finally, for 2018 we anticipate some currency tailwind primarily in the first half of the year. At current exchange rates we expect a positive impact of $0.07 to $0.09 in the first quarter and $0.23 to $0.25 for the full year. As you know over the last month exchange rates have fluctuated more significantly than we've typically seen and we don't know what will happen to rest of the year. So please take this as directional guidance only.  We've made significant progress in our business. The path that we're on with the velocity growth plan along with the investments we're making in our future position the company for sustainable long-term growth. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term financial targets beginning in 2019 and now I'll turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: As you can see our business is growing. It is fundamentally sound and we're confident about our future. We have returned the business to growth and have achieved momentum with comparable sales. 2017 was our best performance in six years. Customers are rewarding us with visits because the actions we're taking to serve them great tasting meals, offer friendly hospitality and provide more choice in how they order, pay and serve their food. The three biggest draw to McDonald's system is continuing to make bold and aggressive investments in our most promising growth platforms. A strong signal of the confidence we have in our future. We're also looking forward to 2018 because there're many opportunities that will bring the building brand excitement with our customers and our people. This spring we'll gather at our worldwide convention in Orlando with nearly 14,000 owner operators supplies employees in the McDonald's system. This will be a tremendous opportunity for building our enthusiasm as we celebrate our progress and then rally together to pursue our even greater ambitions in the years ahead.  As I mentioned this is the 50th anniversary of the BigMac a one of a kind sandwich invented by Jim Delligatti one of our earliest McDonald's franchisees. We have exciting plans to celebrate the many fans who remained so passionate all these years later about this iconic burger.  Our flagship Chicago restaurant is receiving a dramatic makeover and it will offer great convenience and hospitality to our customers when it reopens later this year. The modern designs will play our latest technology and decor side, the green space, planters and outdoor sitting and a park for community to enjoy.  And, I can't wait to take another picture there and advancing the evolution of our culture, when we open our new headquarters in Chicago's West Loop. Moving into the heart of such a dynamic city will put us closer to our customers and energize the McDonald's team.  We are becoming a better McDonalds and as we do, its driving better results. While pleased with the progress we made in 2017, we have far greater ambitions. We have the right organization and the right plan. The fact always we put in place is delivering growth today, we are confident they will serve as the spring board accelerating our future success.  So, thanks everyone, and now I'll turn it over to Mike to lead the Q&A.\nA - Michael Flores: Thanks Steve, so we will now open up the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions]. And give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions please limit yourself to one question and we will come back to you with follow-up questions as time may allow. Now the first question is from David Palmer with RBC. David?\nDavid Palmer: This is regarding U.S. it wasn't that long ago that surveys that we have done or seen elsewhere had McDonald's U.S. towards the bottom of the pack and if you are -- in the peer set, in things like quality and even towards the middle of the pack and things like value and convenience where you think McDonald's should obviously be winning. Those surveys are probably pretty stale now. You are probably seeing some improvements but perhaps place where you have made the most progress? And then it maybe it makes sense to tie into a market like Canada where you are further along with reimaging and other initiatives, how you think the brand perception can improve from here? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: You are absolutely right, I mean clearly, we see at a market by market that we are very close to all the consumer research and feedback we can get. I mean very simply, I guess you could characterize it into brand perceptions but also operational metrics as well and the two kinds of got to hand it hand.  What we have seen around the world, and what we are beginning to see in the U.S. is when you look at a brand like McDonald's everything that you do communicates, so the look and feel of the restaurants, the quality and engaging element of our marketing programs, the friendliness of our people and their enthusiasm, technology innovation, you saw us talk about keeping the business for the future as well.  So, what we are beginning to see is as we can change the broad-based investment both in our people and our restaurants in the menu improvements such as through poultry supply chain with the antibiotics, whether for the clean label nuggets and so on all of these things communicate at businesses on the move and a business that\u2019s heading in the direction that our customers wants us to.  So, we are certainly encouraged we are seeing some improvement in operational metrics in terms of friendliness, better service in terms of the customers perceptions and then you look at the broader brand metrics like is a brand for -- it is a company for a customer like me for example, so broader brand metrics, and we are beginning to see that mix. begins in the markets that are more advanced and you can look on the more developed markets, markets like Canada as you mentioned UK, Australia but we also see it into a number of our high growth markets where we already have modernized the estate and really repurposed the whole employment preposition countries like Netherlands and Poland and Spain and Italy. We begin to see as each part of progress we make it's just a mix all brand perceptions and also just the taste and quality of the food perceptions go up if you are able to satisfy customers in more environment.  So, we are encouraged its early days we finish the year in the U.S. with around 3,000 of our restaurants really representing the look and feel that we are proud of going forward and with the further acceleration that we've announced the day, the 2018 we are going to have probably just north half of our state converted into really a great expression of the forward-looking brand McDonald's by the end of 2018. So, we are encouraged but a lot of work to do.\nMichael Flores: And next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Bittner: Can you just give us any insights into any sales benefits if any that you are seeing so far from your national value platform whether you are seeing a change in the industry gap or just incrementality in your business would be helpful. And could you also second to that help us understand that this platform has changed to sales mix from value in any meaningful way in your sales driver's recent history?\nSteve Easterbrook: It's really too early for us to give any meaningful feedback on the dollar menu 1, 2 and 3 and it's only been 20 plus days it's been in the marketplace. And when you introduce a platform as strong and that's being built upon for the medium-and-long-term it\u2019s going to take 3 to 6 months for it to fully ebbed in the minds of consumers.  With that said in terms of the gap we're beginning to see in the marketplace broadly we ended the year in a competitively strong position. We announced in the U.S. a sales number of 4.5%. I think the overall competitive set was pretty much flat I think it was plus 0.2. So, we have noted that over the four quarters of the year the gap has suddenly increased. They are giving there any future direction but it was very encouraging for us that the more illicit the plans that we execute across the market we are making a dent in the competition which clearly gives us further encouragement.  On a weekly basis I think we outperformed the peer group in 48 out of the 52 weeks across 2017 so again really consistent strong competitive performance marching here in the U.S. We feel good about the dollar menu 1, 2, 3. I mean just as an overall guide we are not seeing a significant or material shift in product mix. we are still seeing average shared growth across the overall business. so, we feel that it's settling in and embedding in well. we've brought in some of the elements which was successful for us in 2017 so that should be the dollar any size fountain drinks, which we know is very powerful and very strong. there were really augmented with some breakfast products and both across beef and chicken menu as well including then also the $3 happy meal.so we're off to a good start. it's very days to comment anything meaningful for it but it's certainly encouraging.\nMichael Flores: Next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Kevin, can you speak to a long-term CapEx target you laid out at the Analyst Day back in March and how would expect it to bridge from 2.4 billion in CapEx in 2018 to 1.2 billion ultimately and just kind of in reference to the original expectations for about $1.7 billion per year through 2020.  And just one clarification as well, you talked about investing in tax savings in your experience for the future. Just want to clarify, you're investing greater than a 55% stake that you originally did in 2017 into the modernized restaurants in 2018?\nKevin Ozan: Okay, Andrew. I'll try and hit all of them, if I forget something you'll remind me, but let me start with the capital. So, you're right when we talked about it at Investor Day back on March 1st, we expected that it would take several years to complete the experience of the future roll out in the US.  We've now taken the opportunity with the momentum we have and with the operators on board so effectively just pull that forward some. So, what you'll see is a total capital envelop of around $2.4 billion in 2018. You should expect a relatively similar amount in 2019.  My guess is there will be a little left over in 2020 I hesitate to say it'll be completely done in '19 but it should be significantly completed by the end of 2019. And then probably beginning in 2021 would be the ongoing normal run rate which right now absent anything new that we know about would be in that 1.2 to 1.3 billion range. So that's how I think of kind of evolution of the capital, it isn't spending more than we originally anticipated it's just moving forward the spends that we're able to complete the EotF projects quicker.  Same with that investment is as you referred to our 55% hasn't changed, it's just accelerating the timing of some of those projects but our contribution rates, the partnering program we have is consistent with what we talked about. So that hasn't changed, again it\u2019s just the timing aspect we'll be able to get the projects done quicker than we originally anticipated.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just to add to that, and Kevin's absolutely right, I just want to put into context the significance of the acceleration that we are describing here. We exit 2017 with around 3000 restaurants fully converted. We started the year with around 700 so 2017 therefore we completed around 2300 projects. so, this is the best part of doubling that rate and again just to put it into context something similar to do in the UK, France and Germany all together in one year. I mean this is a massive undertaking, a massive signal of confidence from all of our operators and ourselves. But the other piece, the devil's always in the detail and our aim isn't just to get 4000 done it\u2019s to get 4000 done very-very well because owner/operator is committing their money into this and every customer would like to see how the go stand the execution.  So, for us this is a really significant undertaking ensuring our confidence in the future of the business and the confidence that we have for an infrastructure investment such as this as a result of tax reform I think is worth pointing out.\nMichael Flores: Next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Hey thank you, I have one question and then a follow up if I could. The first is actually considering such a strong year I was surprised to hear Steve say that you think you can accelerate the momentum next year. So, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what that means, is that sort of talking about brand perception or do you actually see traffic and comps accelerate and so just trying to understand maybe quantitatively what that commentary means. And then the second question I had was sort of broad on, was a follow up on the value discussion. I think some of your smaller competitors have tried to be aggressive on value and have seen kind of a worst-case scenario where they maybe get better traffic but there is pressure on check and profit dollars. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how your marketing messaging allows you to drive value traffic but still see higher check averages, is it just your volume of marketing, is it the nature of the messaging just trying to understand how you are able to do this thing from what some of your other competitors are seeing?\nSteve Easterbrook: I'll have a step of both of those and Kevin can join me on things I miss. We don\u2019t want to get into any habit of forward projecting if you like but as we enter this year and because we are reviewing our plan, areas of strength, areas of opportunity, the path is delivering and through 2017 delivers -- we exceeded what we expected out of our fan in 2017. That gives us encouragement that we have a number of facets of our business that are working, whether it's the core nuts and bolts focus in the market on the day to day operations, your friendly service, hot fresh food, staffing our restaurants fully, and the real basics of the customer experience but all the way through to the efficient accelerators and the other platforms of growth whether it's through delivery, the emergence of some of our digital and technology and the growth opportunity that has and what we continue to see out of experience the future.  So, you have heard me talk probably number of times around how we try to layer these platforms of growth upon each other. They don\u2019t all outperform, but if they can just underperforming we go back and take a look and review and look to enhance and want to outperform our expectations. As we enter the year we feel confident that the plans we built and the progress we have in place are going to continue to deliver strong growth.  As we continue to invest -- you are absolutely right the brand perceptions will undoubtedly improve if we continue to execute to the standard that we set ourselves. So, once we have about a third of our global stakes now fully modernized in the truest sense actually continue that pace. We know that the brand perceptions improve in restaurants is a much more modernized. So that we find, we are confident that the key metrics both the -- if you like the lightening indicators and the leading indicators both the financial metrics as well as the brand metrics will continue to improve. With regards to value, it\u2019s a market share fight, we don\u2019t see really, I think any significant broader market growth this year. We are certainly not planning on that. So therefore, we know we are in a market share fight and values is where it really does get the street fighting really hits.  What we feel good about on the marketing side here and particularly if I talk to the U.S. is two things. One, we have great quality and great value items in the $1, $2, $3. If you look at that line up these iconic products the customers are familiar with are confident with and really, I think exudes much of the values and the things around what we stand for as a business and also as we develop our menu. So, as well as offering great value and we think it reinforces the quality perception and taste perceptions that we are looking to move.  In terms of just the muscle we have, I mean one of the changes that the operators in the company signed up to last year was we were going to divert more money from the local agencies, the local costs, into national, into the national marketing cost. And that is A, more efficient in spend, and secondly, gives us much more universal trout.  So, I think that makes us somewhat in -- really gives us a differentiating muscle as opposed to any of our competitors. so, I think the quality of the lineup and the financial muscle we have through our national marketing program in general we think will remain very competitive on the value add. \nMichael Flores: Next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChris O'Cull: It looks like the average U.S. company operated store experience have decline year-over-year in the margin profit dollars. I'm curious if franchises experience similar performance and given the level of promotional activity and labor pressure what comps you really need in the U.S. to increase that margin dollar profit?\nKevin Ozan: It's a fair comment because historically we have always set kind of a normal inflationary environment that a 2% to 3% comp would maintain margins. I think clearly today the 2 to 3 isn't enough mainly because of labor pressures. For us it's both on the cost side as well as we are investing in labor to make sure that we deploy all these initiatives in the right way. on the operator side it certainly we have the wage pressures. Having said all that their cash flow is still doing pretty well right now so, in the U.S. they are near all-time high cash flow so they are able to still invest in the business and move forward will all these EotF projects that we need them to do. So, while there is additional pressure because of labor, the fact that we are growing guest counts and growing account sales is affording the operators with the cash flow that they need to be able to appropriately invest in the business. \nSteve Easterbrook: And just actually just share comps of the previous points as well from Sara's question, if I would continue comment on our marketing shift and to national from local because of the [Indiscernible] we can gain, we've been able to slightly reduce the marketing contribution that goes with the P&Ls of both our operators and our company stores. So again, this is huge in our size and scale not just an advantage to get us share of voice and drive the effectiveness of our programs, but actually, we can do more cost effective and pass on that benefit through the P&L, so it turns out to be a win-win forward of us. \nKevin Ozan: The only other thing I would reiterate is we have talked about our conscious efforts to invest in some of this labor in the near term. so, some of that investment in our labor as far as to make sure we deploy all these initiatives is a near term phenomenon that we would expect for another couple of quarters but shouldn\u2019t be ongoing then forever if you will.\nMichael Flores: The next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino : My question is on delivery in the U.S. and Steve I think you mentioned that is becoming a more meaningful contributor to comp so I was wondering if you would be willing to share some metrics around that, what type of sales lift are you seeing overall and comment on what you've seen in the markets that have been offering delivery for the longest period of time.  And then lastly if you could also talk about what the franchises are seeing from a margin perspective on those delivery transactions?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I would speak a little more to delivery. I am not going to give any precise commercial information, that wouldn\u2019t be sensible. But I'd like to talk about platforms of growth. We believe we have 5, 6, 7 platforms of growth all working at the same time. Delivery is one of those. So, it's now featuring as a meaningful contributor to the overall sales build we have in the market. We did a really good job at rapidly rolling out delivery across -- well globally but also across the US and we ended with around 5000 restaurants with UberEATS here in the US. So, we got a two-pronged approach for 2018. One is to continue to expand but it won't be at the same rate because we're looking at major cities and open areas and we hit a good number of those early and clearly, we can only expand at the rate that the UberEATS coverage will offer as well.  But I mean we have a, have a great opportunity to actually just be aware of this and the usage from a customer perspective, the US is a little behind in terms of guest counts but the number of other established markets. so again, what we are doing is kind of the stuff you'd expect us to do for some great best practice sharing, what is it that's driving such high take up in markets like the UK, Australia increasingly so Canada. We're getting some great results also out of Netherlands, out of our growing businesses in Spain and Italy as well. So, we believe we can get the adoption and frequency to increase in the restaurants that are already offering delivery and we will just generally expand that number across the US as the UberEATS coverage expands. In terms of the franchisee, clearly is a different margin dynamic because there's a fee element that we pay to the provider through UberEATS which compensates for the fact that we don't have some hire drivers, run cars, have all the insurance cost, all the complexity and the complication of that, so that's kind of clearly the consideration balance we have to make. But the reality is this is, we're seeing the vast proportion of this is incremental business. And as long as that business stays incremental then we get an incremental dollar profit as well. It will be a lower margin percent but it's incremental dollars which is ultimately what we're aiming for and frankly we believe we had a bit of a jump on the market here as well with us by leveraging the size and scale. We will find ourselves very high up if you were to go on to UberEATS in many of the markets now, we'll be one of the early recommended restaurants just because the operation that we run now we can actually get from order to delivery in under 30 minutes pretty much everywhere we are which puts us right at the head of the pack in terms of the convenience that we offer customers.\nMichael Flores: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. A question on I guess probably on franchisee sentiments, I mean you talk about massive signal confidence in the franchisees, obviously they're pleased with the sales on that. I am just wondering if you could take a bit about is there any pushback you often hear about the overloads from some of the initiatives going on simultaneously Steve as you mentioned you've got five, six, seven platforms going. so just wondering whether from an ops or a cost standpoint you're getting any focused pushback. and one of those initiatives I'm assuming is fresh beef which even give much color to today I was just wondering whether as an aside you can offer anything incremental in terms of feedback from test or the timing and pace of the rollout that you're expecting which I believe was in the middle of '18. Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yeah, sure Jeff, so franchisee sentiment, clearly, is something we work so closely hand in hand with the owner/operators. I mean our owner operators knew as our leadership team in the US, they were building a very aggressive and confident plan and they call it in the US the bigger, bolder Vision 2020, so they collectively built this plan knowing that there was a lot tied up into it.  As we entered the 2018, there is a totally expensive combination of excitement and confidence and also just the anxiety that comes with the workload and commitments that have to be made. So, I would say so much as push back but just the reality is now hitting home, we have got a lot of work to do, both at a local and the restaurants of the owner/operators and also at a national level to execute some of these priorities.  But Jerry its nothing that\u2019s are changed and talk about and then really, we are looking to alleviate the anxiety just with some great execution. If we can execute Dollar Menu 1, 2, 3 from the start of the year, we have got a couple of other promotional campaigns coming up soon that why we are really exciting and drive the business. And then if we can get the -- and change the bit of liability through the technology through the mobile app our customers have and also improve on the user experience for example on the self-order kiosk. There is loads of areas we are looking to continuously improve and as we do so our collective confidence grows. But I wouldn\u2019t say the sentiment is any different from any normal human reaction to when you enter a year and you got to work really hard also write some big cheques, always makes you think twice and I understand that and Jerry we are very empathetic to that. With regards to fresh beef, yes, haven\u2019t spoken so much about this because we are in roll out stage, we are converting a lot of our facilities around the country in order to meet the demand when we go to national launch which should be around May-June tie. So, we really completed the first full wave. We probably have now 2,000 to 3,000 restaurants, which now have the fresh beef or quarter pounders and our signature range. And clearly, we have a phased rollout for the next two to three months. But the feedback we are getting is clearly unique diligence in the operational training in order to get our grill teams familiar with the new procedures, but once they are embedded by crew members are very tactful they learn very quickly. I mean the other -- it's mostly encouraging feedback we are getting is from customers who just love the taste of the fresh beef and the quarter pounder. So, we are getting unsolicited feedback from customers on a notable improvement, so again that just gives further encouragement as we roll this out in the next two, three months.\nMichael Flores: The next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy: If I may two questions, one to clarification. On G&A did you intentionally or was it accidentally that you removed the 5% to 10% additional savings beyond '19? And then just as a follow up to some of the questions on the franchise profitability. Based on your conversations how are they thinking about their spread between not just the investments hitting OTS and value but also what they are seeing on a labor front as companies like Starbucks and Walmart has once again taken it upon themselves to pass along savings and raise wages, any color you could provide on that would be helpful.\nKevin Ozan: I'll start with the G&A. So yes, it was conscious that we took out the 5% to 10%. I guess just to reiterate some of the things I said we have been focused on both savings G&A and shifting some of our spend from maintenance to areas that grow the business.  The way I -- our overall philosophy is to achieve savings as far away as possible from the areas of the business that directly impact our customers. So that\u2019s where we have been focused. We have realized that we are going to need to continue to invest in technology and digital in order to keep up with where the world is going and our customers' expectations. So, we're going to comment to the $500 million but not commit to anything past that.  We do look at a variety of G&A measures both internally and externally to compare with our peers so we look at G&A as a percent of sales, we look at G&A as a percent of operating income, because effectively the G&A is incurred to grow sales and operating income and I'm not a 100% sure that everyone in the industry classifies all the cost exactly the same way so to me the ultimate measure is looking at operating margin, kind of how efficient are you at bringing revenues down at the bottom line.  So, we look at all those measures to ensure that we are spending our cost efficiently, we're going to continue our financial discipline. I think over the long term we would expect that our G&A would be at or below 2% of sales but for now we're going to commit to the 500 and just keep reevaluating and keep our discipline.  Related to the labor cost. It's very early days and each of us is working on the programs that we are building for the benefit of our people so it's no immediate impact we can see but overall, I would say that the fight for talent continues, it's going to get increasingly challenging to attract the talent you want into your business and then you go to work really hard through training and development to retain them. so, the local level owner/operators company restaurants clearly want to stay competitive on pay but also want to differentiate ourselves through the program such as our trace of opportunities which we are looking to significantly enhance the benefits to our employees from that and also broaden the accessibility beyond the U.S. into a global program as well because we want to make sure that all of our people around the world stand to benefit. So, we remain very close to it and that's actually one of the advantages of a franchising organization such as ours is that when owner/operator is close to the market as they are very swift to adapt to the changing marketplace. \nMichael Flores: So, we've reached the top of the hour. We will take one more question and that will be from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass : This question is around return on capital goals. First of all, just the lower tax rate, does that necessarily imply higher dividend even keeping your payout ratio the same or do you tend to sort of smooth that overtime. Anything with leverage ratios as tax reforms or potentially you think about leverage. And then finally you think about sort of overall return on capital goals. I know you are still within that 2019 goal but is it -- given you got line of sight in CapEx spending a couple of years when is the appropriate time to talk about new goals or return on capital for investors to think about under this new all franchise business model?\nKevin Ozan: Let met talk about I guess the various pieces of written on capital that you mentioned since you hit them all. That's a board decision, we will review with them kind of ongoing we didn\u2019t have a new discussion right now related to changing dividend kind of as quick reactions to tax reforms but we certainly will have those discussions as the year progresses in our normal course. I don\u2019t know that a tax reform in of itself changes dramatically the way we think overall about dividends. we've been committed to dividends for over 40 years, well we're still committed strongly to dividends. We do look at things like payout ratio and so we will continue to look at just as a guide we don\u2019t have a set target but we will continue to look at payout ratio to help inform that decision. We did as you indicated even with our acceleration of CapEx for 2018 and 2019 we're still comfortable in indicating that we'll return about a $24 billion to shareholders through 2019 which was at the top end of our range.  Leverage ratios you know I think the rating agencies are still working through some of how to look at tax reform and how to think about their model for us right now. We continue to believe that we're at the appropriate credit ratings so we don't have a plan to change our credit rating. That gives us a little bit of room plus or minus in any given year and so as we think about returning it does imply a potentially a little bit you know little bit flexibility in adding some debt and as I indicated our priority still is the same, the first priority is clearly to invest in the business for growth and then we'll consider dividend and share buyback.\nMichael Flores: Well thank you, I'll now turn it back over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, just before I close just to add to Kevin's last comment. Just not to lose sight, the fact is our operating business is still the massive generator of cash and there's no doubt tax reform provides an encouraging help post for our owner/operators and ourselves but growing the business is going to be the primary source of cash growth going forward and that's where we remain focused.  So just to close up I just want to reiterate our philosophy strategy is working and we really do have high expectations for McDonald's in 2018. We've got strong leadership team and a great commitment and are live over the franchisees, supply partners and employees who make up the three nuggets store the McDonald's system. So, we got great confidence about where we're going to take our business this year and look forward to sharing that with you as we progress, thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's corporation investor conference call, you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-10-24 15:57:38", "content": "Executives: Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.

Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan; and President of McDonald's USA, Chris Kempczinski. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and the 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our momentum continued to build across the business in the third quarter. Across all our operating segments, we serve more customers, more often, driving global comparable sales up 6% and comparable guest counts up 2.4%. This marks nine consecutive quarters of global comparable sales growth and our third consecutive quarter of comparable guest count growth. We're building a better McDonald's and winning back customers with great-tasting food, compelling value and an enhanced experience. In each of these areas, our markets have built sustainable platforms, integrated and grounded in deep local insights. They've enabled us to move at greater speed, efficiency and impact to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Whilst we've been building momentum across the McDonald's system, and our performance is globally broad-based, I'm particularly pleased that the U.S. business has regained its stride. As Mike mentioned at the top of the call, we have Chris Kempczinski, President of McDonald's USA, joining us today. Later in the call, Chris will provide insight into the drivers of U.S. performance. But to get us started, Kevin will provide texture on our financial results for the quarter.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Steve. As Steve mentioned, our positive comparable sales and guest counts in all segments reflect the momentum that continues to build across our system. I want to provide a little more context on how each segment contributed to our global performance for the third quarter. U.S. comp sales increased 4.1% for the quarter, with a positive comp sales gap versus our QSR sandwich competitors. Chris will provide more details on the drivers of this performance in a few minutes. Comparable sales for the International Lead market segment were up 5.7%, led by continued strong momentum in the UK and Canada and positive performance across the rest of the segment. High Growth segment comp sales increased 6.2%, with China continuing its strong performance as the most significant contributor and the segment's European markets delivering strong comps as well. And comparable sales for the Foundational markets rose 10.2%, led by Japan's double-digit comp performance along with positive results in each of the segment's geographic regions. Our Velocity Growth Plan is not only driving top-line growth, it's also benefiting our operating performance. Earnings per share for the quarter grew more than 50% to $2.32. This included $0.56 of special items, consisting of a gain on the sale of our businesses in China and Hong Kong and unrelated non-cash impairment charges. Excluding these items and prior-year strategic charges, our EPS was $1.76, up 9%, or 7% in constant currencies, over third quarter last year. Moving on to pricing in commodities, our third quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up 2.2%, which was slightly below food away from home inflation of 2.4%, as we continue to have a disciplined approach to menu pricing and provide our great-tasting food at an affordable price. Commodity costs in the U.S. for the third quarter were up 1.5% versus last year. We continue to expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase about 1% for the full year, reflecting the anticipated commodity pressure in the back half of the year. For the International Lead markets, commodity costs were up more than 2.5% for the third quarter, and menu prices were up about 1.5% year-over-year. Moving down the P&L, for the quarter, our positive comp sales along with the combined impact of our major refranchising transactions drove an increase in franchise margins of $219 million and a decline in company-operated margins of $148 million. On a percentage basis, consolidated company-operated margins increased 70 basis points to 19.1% for the quarter. About half of the improvement was due to the benefit of having no depreciation expense for China and Hong Kong, as the assets were classified as held for sale until July 31. For the High Growth segment, about three-quarters of the margin percent improvement can be attributed to this same benefit. On a percentage basis, we expect fourth quarter margins for the remaining company-operated restaurants in the High Growth segment to be similar to results reported in fourth quarter 2016, as the segment will no longer have this depreciation benefit. Regarding G&A, at the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected our G&A for the year to be down about 7% to 8% in constant currencies, with fluctuations between quarters due to the timing of spending. For the third quarter, our G&A was down 4% in constant currencies, which resulted in total costs being down 8% through the first nine months of the year. We now expect G&A cost to be down about 7% for the full year, which means fourth quarter G&A should be down a similar percentage to third quarter. Third and fourth quarter G&A are higher than first and second quarter this year, primarily due to two main reasons: higher technology spending in the back half of the year as we continue to develop, enhance and deploy technology solutions like our global mobile app and kiosks; and higher spend in the U.S. in the back half of the year, as they deploy Experience of the Future, mobile and delivery. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 33.2%, and the nine month tax rate was 32.8%. Given that, we now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 32% to 33%. Turning to foreign currencies, for the quarter, foreign currency translation benefited results by $0.02 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect a positive impact from foreign currency of $0.04 to $0.06 for the fourth quarter and about $0.01 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year. Finally, as we communicated last month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.01 per share, the equivalent of $4.04 annually. This reinforces our confidence in the company's long-term strategy and our expectation to return $22 billion to $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019. Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to spend a minute on the achievement of a milestone in our strategic franchising initiative. The sale of our China and Hong Kong markets in the third quarter caps off our goal to refranchise 4,000 company-owned restaurants, which will accelerate our growth in these markets while creating a more stable stream of revenue and earnings. In just under three years, we've increased the percentage of franchised restaurants from 81% to 91%. And franchised margins will now comprise more than 80% of our total restaurant margin dollars going forward. We'll continue to optimize our ownership mix by refranchising restaurants in certain of our large mature markets, like the U.S., using the same financial rigor and discipline that we began a couple years ago. And we'll continue to evaluate other markets to determine whether a developmental license model is the right model to efficiently grow in those markets. As I said at our March 1 Investor Day, our refranchising activity will have a dilutive impact on our revenue, operating income and EPS growth rates in the near term, making year-over-year comparisons through 2018 choppy. We received cash proceeds of about $1.6 billion from the China, Hong Kong transaction, which we plan to use to repurchase shares. We expect the refranchising transactions completed over the last year will have a negative impact on EPS of a few cents per quarter until third quarter 2018. Also, the depreciation benefit of about $100 million that we realized this year will not reoccur in 2018. Going forward, our results for these markets include sales-based royalties, along with a 20% equity pick-up for China, Hong Kong. The critical moves we've made through our refranchising efforts will benefit our business for years to come as our strategic partners unlock the growth potential in these markets, without the use of our G&A and capital resources, while we receive a steady stream of royalty income. And they will also lead to an increase in our operating margin on our way to a target of mid-40s under our new more heavily-refranchised and efficient business model. So in the near-term, we're focused on growing comparable sales and guest counts and we're pleased with our recent performance which has benefited primarily from running better restaurants. At the same time, we're confident that our velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery will continue to grow the business. Beginning in 2019, once we've lapped completion of the major refranchising transactions, we expect to return to revenue growth and also achieve the other long-term financial targets that we've established, including steady and reliable earnings growth. Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. At the top of the call, I talked about the growth platforms each market has built around menu, value and experience that is designed to grow guest counts, by retaining the customers we have, regaining customer visits we've lost and converting casual customers to more committed customers. During the quarter, each market executed with innovative and compelling approaches to menu, value and convenience that drove incremental customer traffic and higher average check. Every major market now offers a range of premium chef-crafted big burgers and chicken sandwiches with artisan ingredients and enticing flavor profiles. In France, the Signature beef and chicken line uses breads, meats, cheeses and sauces that capture the regional gastronomy of the country. The UK is having great success in their modernized restaurants with their version of Signature beef, inspired by the English pub burgers with thick, juicy beef and beechwood-smoked bacon, piled high with freshly-prepared toppings on a brioche-style bun. Canada's launch of the Seriously Chicken platform appeals to Canadians' preference for international flavors with local sourcing. It provides a great complement to the market's popular Mighty Angus beef burgers. Italy took note of the success that France and the U.S. had with Grand Mac, and Italians loved it. We know that customers motivated primarily by value and deals come more often and spend more. During the quarter, our markets offered compelling value across the breadth of the menu. For example, Japan, Italy, France and many other markets executed value programs and promotions that leveraged the strength of our popular Minions Happy Meal to drive incremental family business with value bundles and dessert specials. We are increasingly driving traffic and check growth with digital offers. Retention of mobile offers continues to grow month-on-month, with a meaningful portion of the redemptions representing incremental visits. Importantly, this is also building our base of digital users, increasing awareness and adoption as we deploy the mobile order and pay functionality of our mobile path. Although they did not have a material impact on our results for the quarter, we are making solid progress on the deployment of our Velocity Growth Plan accelerators. We remain on track to deploy mobile order and pay to 20,000 restaurants by the end of the year, including all of our U.S. restaurants. We continue to learn as we deploy, rapidly implementing updates, which has challenges and opportunities as we expand in each successive market. We made significant progress with expanding delivery of scale throughout our markets. Over the course of the past nine months, we've introduced delivery in over 5,000 restaurants across 20 countries. Along with the 3,500 restaurants in existing delivery markets across Asia and the Middle East, we now offer delivery in over 20% of McDonald's restaurants around the world. We continue to improve the model as we scale, remaining on track to offer delivery in 10,000 total restaurants by the end of the year. We're take learnings from our top-performing delivery markets and spreading the best approaches around the world. We remain confident that delivery will be a powerful accelerator for our business as we look at markets where it's gaining traction. The third velocity accelerator is rolling out Experience of the Future, or EOTF. We are continuing with improvements inside our restaurants that make the customer experience more personal and less stressful. EOTF now has been deployed with all elements in roughly a quarter of the restaurants in the McDonald's system. As they approach full deployment, the UK and Canada are proving how powerful EOTF can be for our customers. And in France and Germany, where we've rolled out EOTF to about one-third of the restaurants in both countries, we're seeing similar results. And many of our other large international markets are not far behind. Successful execution of our growth strategy and, in particular, our digital, delivery and Experience of the Future initiatives, requires the full support and commitment of our Owner/Operators. Recently, I joined Chris on market visits to cities such East St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland and Salt Lake City. I saw many examples where we're successfully running better restaurants, which left me confident about the great alignment we enjoy with our Owner/Operators in the U.S. We share a vision for the future and they're committed to driving the operational excellence that will be key to our success. Now, we'll hear more about the progress of our U.S. business. Thanks for joining us today, Chris.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Thank you, Steve. I appreciate the opportunity to join the call today and update everyone on the state of our U.S. business. The U.S. continues to demonstrate solid growth, and I'm proud of our system and the progress we're making. As I look ahead to 2018, I'm excited about our pipeline of ideas and the growth potential they offer. For us, the key will be to execute at a really high level across a number of initiatives and we're investing a lot of time and effort right now to get that right. Let me provide more insight into our Q3 performance and then I'll talk about how we're preparing for 2018. During Q3, we grew comp sales 4.1%, resulting in a comp sales gap of 440 basis points versus the QSR sandwich competitors. Importantly, our comp sales growth was supported by positive guest count growth. This is our third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth and second consecutive quarter of positive comp guest count growth. For the past three quarters, we have posted a favorable comp gap versus QSR. We're particularly pleased with this performance because we had to overcome the headwinds of a sluggish overall IEO market that currently offers limited traffic growth. Our success can be attributed to several factors. First, we offered compelling consistent value programs across a number of tactics that clearly resonated with our customers. We continued our $1 any size soft drinks program and supplemented it with the return of McPick 2 for $5 that offered some exciting food deals. We're also starting to get real traction with the targeted mobile offers via our app that are tailored to customers' unique buying preferences. Second, we've been able to capitalize on this increased traffic into our restaurants with menu news that drove customers to trade up to premium higher-margin products. In Q2, we launched our Signature Crafted sandwich line available either in beef or chicken, with three flavor combinations, pico guacamole, sweet barbecue bacon and maple bacon Dijon. In August, we rotated in a new Sriracha flavor that gave the sandwich Crafted line an extra kick. In September, we also reintroduced McCaf\u00e9 to the U.S. This meant a new, more modern look for the McCaf\u00e9 brand and new choices, including the reintroduction of our McCaf\u00e9 Espresso line after a significant equipment upgrade across our system. The McCaf\u00e9 Espresso products perform very well, reaffirming our systems confidence that McCaf\u00e9 can be a significant growth platform for us in the future. As we've seen with both Signature Crafted and McCaf\u00e9, when we improve the taste and quality of our products to meet customers' rising expectations, they reward us with more business. Finally, we're seeing encouraging customer response to our velocity accelerators including delivery, digital and Experience of the Future. Through our partnership with UberEATS, we now offer delivery in 3,700 restaurants and we're on track to reach 5,000 restaurants by year-end. We're learning a lot about delivery and seeing particular success in dense urban metros with high penetration of younger customers, like New York, Boston, Miami and Los Angeles. I truly believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on this opportunity. We're also continuing to roll out mobile order and pay with a new curbside check-in option. I'm really excited about the potential of curbside to evaluate the convenience of McDonald's to a whole new level for our customers. We now have mobile order and pay in over 6,000 restaurants. And we expect to reach all 14,000 restaurants by the end of the year. And last, we're making good progress with our Experience of the Future projects and we're seeing comp sales lifts consistent with our targets. We currently have Experience of the Future deployed in 13% of restaurants and that number will increase significantly over the next couple of years. As the pace of activity in the U.S. accelerates, it's critical that our restaurants are properly staffed and trained to execute at a high level. Our McOpCo and operator organizations are investing in labor right now to train for initiatives like hot off the grill, hospitality, curbside, delivery. This will have a temporary impact on margins for the next six to 12 months as we work through our deployment calendar. We've seen this before in other markets like Canada, Australia and the UK when they've launched similarly aggressive plans and we feel quite confident about our ability to manage through this short-term situation. At the same time, we're also ramping up our internal project management capabilities to prepare, deploy and maximize each initiative. We've created dedicated Project Management Offices at both the national and regional levels to ensure we anticipate resource bottlenecks and flex organizational capacity as needed. We aim to prove that size and speed do not need to be antithetical to one another. Two years ago, Steve declared that McDonald's needed to run better restaurants and nowhere was that more evident than in the U.S. market. As Steve mentioned, we recently visited a number of U.S. cities, including East St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Salt Lake, Houston and it was really a proud moment for our owner operators to showcase their progress. On almost every dimension, the U.S. is running better restaurants and that's showing up in the business results. At the same time, that pride and confidence in our performance is helping to energize the system to pursue an even more aggressive growth agenda. Almost 100% of U.S. operators have now signed commitment letters in support of a holistic multi-year growth strategy that will update the entire system to EOTF, make important equipment upgrades to deliver better food and ensure we remain competitive on value. We're excited about what's to come in the U.S., and I look forward to updating you periodically on our progress. Now, back to you, Mike.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Chris. We'll now open the call for analysts and investor questions. Now, the first question is from David Palmer with RBC. David?\nDavid Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. If I could just do one question for Kevin, you mentioned some facts speaking to this. Obviously, your profit growth, excluding one-times, was very strong in the U.S. and in International Lead, but was held back by other High Growth and foundation (sic) [Foundational] markets. And clearly, you're getting some refranchising and licensing actions dragging on that. I think originally, you thought flat EBIT impact from these effects, these refranchising and licensing actions. Is that still the expectation? How much was the drag, and then should we expect an equal tailwind perhaps starting in the third quarter in 2018? Thank you.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Hey, David. Yes. So let me try and explain. As you mentioned, there's a lot of noise in this quarter and there will be for the next few quarters because of these refranchising transactions. So what we've said is once you kind of lap these franchising transactions, so I'll say beginning in fourth quarter of 2018, that's when we get to what I'll call the new norm. Until then, it's going be a little rough on a comparison basis because you have two things going against you. One is kind of the results of these markets as wholly-owned in 2017 compared to them as developmental license markets in 2018. And on top of that, you have this depreciation benefit that we received in 2017 that we won't have in 2018. Once we get through all of that, what we've said is essentially on a EPS level at the beginning is we'll be relatively neutral because the proceeds we've gotten in, we will use to buy back shares. And so at an EPS level, we'll be effectively relatively neutral once we're able to buy all those shares and have them built into the calculation. Operating income in the near term will be down a little bit because the income we've given up as wholly-owned is more in the near term than the income we'll get on a royalty basis, if you will, as a DL. On a free cash flow basis, it'll be immediately accretive because the capital that we're saving from the DL-ing these markets effectively outweighs the operating income that I'm losing. So it will be immediately accretive to free cash flow. Thanks.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara?\nAnna Papp - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Anna Papp representing Sara. So in terms of delivery, do you now have a large enough sample to draw some conclusions about the impact on comps? And also, can you talk a little bit about profitability? One of the things we hear from some of the private companies we speak to is that it's difficult to make delivery profitable even when it's outsourced to third parties and, therefore, doesn't require as much in upfront investments. Could you talk a little bit about what kinds of fixed and variable costs your franchisees incur and what kind of profitability you anticipate? Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Right. I'll have a stab at that one. So I mean, clearly, we're getting enough of an early read to be encouraged by delivery. So we've pursued \u2013 delivery have pursued a very aggressive rollout program. And our primary lead partner on this one has been UberEATS. And effectively, we've looked to expand wherever UberEATS has coverage around the world. And they've actually been doubling-down on their expansion to help meet our ambition as well, so it's been working well as a partnership between the two of us. And yes, we're getting good early trading results. What we are finding is, not surprisingly, the number of guest counts per store per day does correlate pretty highly to consumer awareness of this. So the markets that have been able to more effectively promote and raise the customer awareness are getting higher take-up per day. I'm not going get into the actual comp buildup on this one, but it's a meaningful contributor in the restaurants that offer delivery. As I say, I want to just make sure we're guarded about what we're saying. We're in 5,000 restaurants so far out of 37,000. So it's meaningful in those that offer it, but clearly we've got some ways to go to get the further scale across the global system. In terms of profitability, it's important that the vast majority of our business is incremental because the way that we're working with the third party operators is \u2013 obviously, there's a commercial relationship between ourselves and a third party operator that would take some of our margin. So we need certainly more than half of this business, if not more than that, to be incremental. And we're certainly finding that we are well up that scale actually. It's really, really encouraging for us. And part of the reason we know that is because we're beginning to collect the consumer data now as well. So we can actually get repeat visit information, daypart information. And the fact that more than 60% of our business comes in evening and overnight, we know is reinforcing the fact this is an incremental business opportunity, revenue stream that we weren't previously tapping into. But we're also getting very strong repeat business from those that use it as well, which again further encourages us. And one of the things we are focusing on internally is what is there that we can do to get the awareness of the fact that we're offering delivery higher up in consumers' minds. So, yes, it's profitable. It's incremental business. And we're looking to continue to go hard at this. And we certainly know our operators are enthusiastic, as are we, as a corporation.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen?\nKaren Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A question on U.S. margins where you talked about some of those upfront investments that you're making behind new initiatives, is that what we're seeing at store level in the year-over-year margin pressure? And then, if so, when you talk about that by six to nine months and then do you actually see costs go away? Or is it the expectation that you would be able to leverage into kind of covering those costs? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, hi, Karen. It's Chris. So certainly, what you're seeing in the trading results that we just posted, you're seeing primarily labor related to the training that I was talking about. There is some commodity inflation, but the biggest drag that we're facing right now is related to the labor investments that are being made. In terms of going forward, I think one of the pieces that remains to be seen for us is just what does the long-term labor inflation look like in the U.S. And so, we have seen with roughly 5% unemployment that labor inflation has been ticking up nationally. In addition, there's local legislation that's going on as well, where minimum wage laws are increasing. So that long-term could be a headwind, which just would require a faster growth rate than what we've historically seen. But I think right now, it's unclear where that goes. I think for us, certainly the investments that we're make right now on training, those are one-time investments that would abate in the next six to 12 months. And I think the longer term, is we just need to keep our eye on labor inflation across the U.S.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Karen, I'll just hook on the back of those well because Chris is right. I guess the tone of the conversations we have, not just with management teams but with our Owner/Operators, clearly is we have a really solid plan. I mean, Chris and the team here have built an ambitious, very broad-based plan. And having a plan is a great start, but you've got to execute it. And we've been very mindful that it is getting the restaurant level details right is more important than having the perfect plan. And we've seen this, wherever we have an execution gap between a stretch in execution, it kind of catches us out because the customers get impacted. And we've also got some great recent experiences with UK and Canada and Australia, who have all deployed ambitious multi-faceted plans. And we've seen this kind of a trend where you'll invest a little more in the shorter-term on the P&L in order to get the execution right. But the payback then comes over that medium to longer term. So I'm comfortable with where we're at. It doesn't mean we're blas\u00e9 about it, but this is not unexpected to us. And, as I say, getting the execution right is our primary focus.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian?\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk a little bit more about your national value platform strategy launching in the United States in early 2018? Any details you're going to provide on that strategy would be helpful to us. And in addition to that, if you could just also address how you expect your U.S. franchisees are going to strategize, making incremental investments and value at a time when store-level margins are declining from the labor investments and what-not. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Sure. Well, one of the things that we have said to our franchisees in the U.S. is we don't have to win on value, but we can't lose on value. And that means we have to be competitive with our investments against a value program. And I think also it's no surprise that over the last, call it, three or four years since we rolled off Dollar Menu, we weren't as competitive as we needed to be on value. And so what you're going to see from us next year is us being really fully competitive with our near-in competitors with a value program there. It's been written about and I don't think it's any surprise that certainly our value program is going to be focused on $1, $2 and $3 price points for an everyday-value piece of it. And then there will also be deals that will pulse in and out throughout the year as a result of that. When you talk about the investment that is being asked of Owner/Operators, one of the things that we talked about is that this plan has to be looked at holistically. And so while there is an investment that's being made on the value side, there are also some significant efficiencies that are being captured on the other side, around particularly marketing and efficiencies that we're getting there, efficiencies that we're getting at the restaurant level. And so when you look at all of it on a blended basis, we think that this is a balanced plan. And I think, most importantly, the fact that our Owner/Operators were at almost 100% signing up for is probably the best testament that they felt comfortable with the value investments being offset by some of the other things in the P&L.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: And I think it's also noteworthy, Chris, that the commitments that's been signed up to is to have the national support, so that the need for some of the local value initiatives is somewhat reduced, because we're putting the national muscles to play here on to support the program, which I think is exciting for us at we enter 2018.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett?\nBrett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. You obviously started to talk more about coffee at your March Investor Day and once again reiterated that it's doing well. What can you share in terms of how much faster it's growing than your overall comp? What are you seeing in terms of daypart breakfast, afternoon, and attachments? And, if I could, how is that doing in terms of traditional in-store purchases versus your mobile order and the loyalty program? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Well, I think we're excited about coffee, in part, because it's a huge category. It's a $30 billion business in the U.S. and it's growing mid-to-high-single digits as a category. So we're excited about the category. It's high margin and we're under-penetrated there. So as we built the plan, it was rally about us getting after an opportunity where we think our McCaf\u00e9 brand has a lot of relevance. We're not going get into the specifics of by product line item, how did those compare versus the average comp, but I would just say that, certainly, we saw the benefit in Q3 of really nice growth on our McCaf\u00e9 business. And as we look out over the next few years, we're expecting to use McCaf\u00e9 as really a platform for us to get additional growth. So we're excited about that. We think we have a good opportunity to get after it. It's really been a question of focus for us. We haven't consistently focused on this in the past. And going forward, it's going be a key area for us.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I'd also just say from a global perspective, when you look at the overall velocity plan that we talk about, Brett, coffee and McCaf\u00e9 is at a different stage in different markets. But if you actually look at the key drivers behind the velocity plan, on the retained category, about retaining customers, clearly, a strong compelling coffee plays really well alongside the food-led breakfast advantage that we have. When you look at regain, there, as we build out our digital capabilities and loyalty in CRM, we think coffee, because it's such a habitual purchase, will play well against those customers who we want to encourage back more often. Then finally, when we talk about converting casual customers to committed, we know coffee and snacking plays strongly against some of those more casual consumers. So each of our major countries, as I said, has a different stage of development of their McCaf\u00e9 programs, but the one thing I would say is that coffee plays a part in all those markets as we go forward.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John?\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning. Two cost-related questions; one is just on the SG&A. So as you've gotten further into technology, it sounds like there was maybe a little heavier spending this quarter. Do you still have the same confidence that you can achieve the overall SG&A goals that you laid out earlier or does this quarter make you think about you need to put more money into that in 2018? Can you reiterate what those goals are and if they've changed at all? The other component of your business that's grown has been the gains on asset sales, excluding the China. It's been still a few hundred million dollars a year. Does that effectively go to nil over the next couple years as refranchising is complete? Or is that still an ongoing piece like it should trade in and out of markets, for example?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, John. Thanks. Let me start with the G&A. What I'd say is right now, we're completely on track with where we expected to be this year. As I said in my remarks, we expected to be down about 7% to 8% in constant currencies. We still expect to be down about 7% for the year. Having said that, it probably is a little more back-loaded this year than we probably thought at the beginning of the year. So the timing of it is a little bit more back-loaded. But what we're seeing is we're achieving significant savings from our refranchising and we're also seeing significant savings in our maintenance, our running the business G&A. That's being partly offset by a significant increase in technology spending. So we're achieving net G&A savings and, at the same time, we're shifting more of our existing spend from maintenance G&A to what I'll call investment G&A, focused on growing the business. So I think overall, we feel a lot better today about where we're spending our G&A, but we're on track with kind of all of our original plans at this point. Regarding the gains, it's a good point. I think you'll probably still see gains in 2018 as we continue to refranchise in some of our conventional license markets, the U.S. and some of the International Lead. After that, that will likely go down a little bit. We won't have as much of the refranchising transactions. We will still have restaurants that exchange hands in kind of normal course of business, so there will always be some restaurants that, just as we always optimize our mix, we'll have some. But it probably won't be to the level that we've seen the last couple years and maybe in 2018. After that, it will likely go down a little bit.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter?\nPeter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious if you could comment a little bit on speed of service in the U.S. and how the Experience of the Future restaurants are comparing on speed of service ticket times versus the rest of the system? Are they moving faster or are they moving slower? Any other sort of color would be helpful.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, well, so I'd say what we typically see is as we're deploying, whether it's EOTF, some of the menu news, et cetera, we typically do see a slight uptick in service times, call it, on the order of five seconds or so. And then, certainly as the crew in restaurants get more experience in whatever the initiative is, we expect to claw most, if not all, of that back over time. I think it's, for us, when you look at the Experience of the Future, one of the things that makes it difficult to really do the from-to on that is because as we bring in Experience of the Future with curbside, you start introducing all sorts of new ways for the customer to interact with the brand. And so maybe in the past, they would just go through the drive-thru because, frankly, they didn't see going into the restaurant as a great experience. Now, they want to go into the restaurants because it's an updated modernized experience where you can get table service there. And so it's really, I think, what we're seeing with Experience of the Future is that customers are choosing new ways to interact with the brand that makes it difficult for us to compare. I think the more relevant metric really, for us, is we look at customer satisfaction. We look at customer satisfaction prior to EOTF and after EOTF. And what we're seeing there are significant improvements on the order of three to five points improvements in overall customer satisfaction. So for us, that gives us reassurance that they are enjoying the initiatives that we're deploying with EOTF and they're having a better experience.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I mean, Chris is absolutely right. I think part of our broader philosophy around Experience of the Future is putting that choice and control in the hands of customers, whether it's how they order, what they order, how they choose to pay and how they're served. And we want to be providing faster service for those customers that really want fast service. At the same time, not everyone wants to be rushed, and, therefore, we're providing more alternatives. Chris's example of curbside is absolutely spot-on. Or maybe you're entering the restaurant and you've got a family with you and you just want to dwell a little more on the kiosk and just take some time ordering. So it's just a much more enjoyable experience. So I guess this is allowing the customer to have that range of choices. And then they can, therefore, if you like, self-select the way they experience McDonald's. And, as I say, where we are more advanced in the rollout of Experience of the Future, the customer satisfaction is noticeably higher. And Chris has already begun to see that in the U.S., which is encouraging, but, again, not surprising. We're confident in the plans we have.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff?\nJeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Just following up on value quickly, so on recent calls, you noted that a few of the 22 U.S. regions have already been more aggressively pursuing, I think, it was the McPick options and combinations of $1 and $2 beverages. So I'm just curious how those three to four regions have performed on a same-store sales basis relative to the rest of the system and if that magnitude of out-performance can tell us anything about, potentially, what we could be seeing from value as we get into 2018.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. I think, as you know, with McPick, certainly this year, there was a heavy local element to it. So we had different regions pursuing different McPick strategies, both the price points that they would hit, but, frankly, also the items that they would be selling for. And so it's difficult to do the comparison that you're talking about because it's not just what item at what price point, but it's also where was the starting price point for that. In general, I think the point that you're making, though, is an accurate one, which is we think that we still had an opportunity to get more competitive on value. Again, we're not trying to win on value, but we can't lose on value. And so I think what you're going be seeing from us going forward is really for us consistently to stay competitive on value. And I think the other thing, as I mentioned earlier in the call, is more of that investment now going forward is going be done and driven at the national level than at the local level, which I think plays to our strength from a marketing communications standpoint where we can really drive that message.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Will?\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, guys. I had a question on the U.S. franchisee base. It seems there's been a fairly aggressive push to both improve, as you referenced earlier, and to naturally consolidate that franchisee base as a result of some meaningful investments required to get to an EOTF format or otherwise. So can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the current domestic franchisee base and how that may change over the coming years as some of this consolidation likely occurs?\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Sure. Well, so one, I think being relatively new to McDonald's, I'd say one of the things that has really been a highlight for me is getting to know our U.S. Owner/Operators. And I'd tell you they're \u2013 it's a very impressive group in terms of what they're able to drive. And so you're seeing that in the results here. Our point of view, and certainly all my discussions with the Owner/Operators in the U.S. has been I would love for every single one of them who's currently in the system today to remain in the system. And so there is no, from our vantage point, concerted effort to try to change the franchisee base or have it look different. But that said, we do have expectations around performance. And, as you said, as we said earlier, running better restaurants is the foundation. And we were not consistently running the type of restaurants in the U.S. that we were expecting to. And so step one has been we have really level set what the standard is for performance in the U.S. At the same time, we've outlined a pretty, what we think is exciting and ambitious growth plan, but it is one that's going to require investment. And so as you put those two together, as you put together a performance expectation along with an investment expectation, we are seeing some Owner/Operators are deciding now is a good time to exit the system. And I think for us, while we certainly are sorry to see folks go, we would rather have that conversation where we're all operating from just a very transparent set of expectations. So I think over the next couple of years, we're probably going to continue to see some evolution of this, but by and large I think the U.S. franchise system as you see it today is going be the same one that we're going to be talking about in a few years.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next question is from Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Alton?\nAlton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you, and good morning. Just go back to delivery, it's actually still very early, of course, with the roll here in the U.S., but can you walk through what you're finding as to if there's any certain categories, whether if it's casual or if it's pizza or otherwise that you guys think you're gaining share from as a result of the rollout of delivery?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Delivery is already a significant market, and I guess the reason we've addressed this with such urgency is, apart from in certain Asian and Middle Eastern markets, we just weren't participating. And given societal trends, given consumer trends, we could only see it growing. So for us, we're a little late to enter, but I think we've entered with more muscle and intent than probably most other competitors could possibly match. I mean, you may have heard me say before but across our top five or six markets around the world, 75% of our customers live within three miles of a McDonald's. So, frankly, there is no other restaurant business on the planet that's closer to more of the global population than we are. And we think that, therefore, that lends itself really well to not just visiting their local McDonald's but also having delivery from their local McDonald's. What are the sort of trends we're seeing? We're certainly seeing it appeal to the younger consumer. We're seeing some great results around college towns. As I say, from a daypart perspective, we see it skew slightly later, so into evenings and overnights. There tends to be more group orders, so we see the average check somewhere between 1.5 to 2 times a typical average check in a restaurant. So I think it really is beginning to clearly demonstrate to us that this is an incremental business for us. It's an incremental revenue stream for us. But we're learning with every day and every week and every market we bring onboard, each market we bring onboard now is just a little wiser than the previous one, because we're building up the experience and the knowledge. And we've also got an opportunity ahead of us that we've yet to be innovating around packaging, innovating around bundling different menu items, and other potential business opportunities further down the line. I think our view was, let's get into the game. Let's show our intent. Let's learn really quickly, and then we'll continue this kind of progress over perfection mentality where we can fine-tune it as time goes on. But it's encouraging to us, and, as I say, you can expect us to move from about 8,500 restaurants today to probably north of 10,000 by the end of this year. And expect to see the trend continue.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Matt?\nMatthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. I just have a follow-up question with respect to the margin comment in the U.S. I'm just curious as far as if I look at digital and I look at the Experience of the Future, it seems like some International markets and regions have been a little bit faster to roll it out, yet we didn't see that type of margin pressure or labor pressure. Can you talk about the dynamics in the U.S. that are now manifesting sort of this labor pressure? Is it with things that are already introduced into the store? Or is this a market that you have to invest in front of the curve where it's waiting then for the same-store sales leverage to flow-through beyond sort of the six to nine-month period that you said you were going to experience labor deleverage?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, Matt. I'll start, and then Chris can add more texture again back to the U.S., but I guess, one thing that's just fair to call out is when we went to the new segment structure, we did so because we wanted to increase the transparency and accountability of what's driving our business. So when we look, for example, at the International Lead markets, not all five markets rolled out at the same time. So, therefore, if one or two markets were feeling a little more margin pressure because they were at the front end, there was a couple of markets that hadn't really embarked on it, but who still had strong margins. So, as you can see, that kind of impact got blended into a five markets segment result. Here, clearly, with the U.S., it's a segment of its own and, therefore, there's no other market to blend it into. But part of the way we're looking to manage this business, and we've said our geographic spread is one of our, we believe, competitive advantages of us as a business, we can have certain markets do some of the heavy lifting while some are investing through this cycle. And, yes, ultimately, we are running this business for the long-term. And if there's a shorter-term impact, I would like to think we've demonstrated ourselves as being fiscally responsible as leaders of this business, but if that's the investments that are required to get the job done properly, then that's what we're going to keep doing. But, Chris, if there's anything more you want to add.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. And I think just to maybe give a concrete example, I mean, as we laid out 2018, we have a number of initiatives that are going to be hitting the market in 2018. One of the biggest ones, the first one that's going to be coming out is, we call it, hot off the grill. It's sometimes referred to as fresh beef. But right now, we're actually bringing on a number of regions onto this platform as we convert over our supply chain. When we bring on hot off the grill or fresh beef into a market, we actually have a six week training curriculum that the entire restaurant goes through. And it's a very intensive training curriculum that they have to go to, actually starting with the operator. The operator first goes through training, and then we literally take every single one of those crew members with both an offsite and then an in-store training experience. All the time that's spent on training for hot off the grill implementation, all of that counts against your labor and none of it is revenue-producing. But it's the sort of thing that we think is required to really make sure that when we do rollout hot off the grill that we execute it at a really high standard. So that's just one example, but we have a number of other initiatives that have the similar type of training and preparation curriculum that's going with it that obviously puts a short-term burden on what needs to be done at the restaurant.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Greg?\nGregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Can you just talk a little bit more about the European consumer? I know we've heard from some of your suppliers and also just generally in the industry, strength out of Europe. And I'm wondering, what do you think's driving that and maybe how sustainable that is?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Greg. I guess it's a mixed picture, and certain of the metrics that we see are somewhat contradictory to a certain degree. I mean, depending on which country you're talking, there's a little bit of nervousness in terms of consumer confidence. We're seeing consumer confidence in the UK get a little weaker as the uncertainty over Brexit continues. I think one thing we do see more consistently, which is a positive certainly for society and putting money in peoples' pockets, is unemployment is typically declining across all of our major markets. And there's better stability and growing consumer confidence in France, and we're seeing the same in Italy as well. Germany continues to be a somewhat more mixed picture. But overall, we're not seeing any of these metrics as a significant tailwind, nor do we think we're kind of having to cycle-tread into a strong headwind, either. I guess the reality for us, our mental approach in every single one of these markets is, let's assume there's only going to be very modest market growth overall. And, therefore, let's take the attitude this is a market share fight and you're going to either be winning or losing customers and let's make sure we're on the right end of that battle.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question's from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. Jeff?\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. I guess Steve or Chris, in the U.S. QSR burger category, it seems like the largest players have most recently been sustaining or even accelerating momentum. And I know if you look back over the past decade or so, it has been historically very difficult to maintain that for a sustainable period. So I'm just wondering maybe what you think has changed in QSR or maybe the dynamic that's changed meaningfully. Or where do you think maybe the share is coming from that's led to this most recent resurgence across broader QSR? And then, Kevin, could you just clarify what you said earlier? Just from an accounting standpoint, I want to make sure I understood. You said 20% equity pick-up with the China, Hong Kong shift. Just want to make sure, that's going flow through the equity and earnings line and just how much you might think that's going be starting this quarter or what we should think of as a run rate. Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I think three of us will have a go at that, Jeff, here's a multifaceted \u2013 if I give a broader perspective on the way that we're looking to grow our business is I'm not interested in the comp cycle. And you hear people talk about it and next quarter's comp will all depend on what the same comp was a year ago. And I think, ultimately, what we're looking at and we've seen it successful in a couple of our more mature markets, is build the platforms of growth that give you long-term sustaining growth, so you're not in that short-term cycle. You don't get dragged into it. And Chris can talk to the QSR industry in the U.S., but certainly as we build our Experience of the Future, our digital platforms, delivery, convert the consumers to are somewhat more casual to our brand, we think that we're building sustaining platforms that are important for us, but, Chris, maybe the U.S.?\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. And so, I think just to build on that, it is a relatively flat market, but I think what we're seeing is that when you're really sharp with your proposition that you're offering the customer, the food that you're offering, the value that you're doing with the experience, when you've really got a compelling proposition to put forth, you can gain significant share. And so, certainly, the comp gap that we've been seeing, our comp gap has been widening over the last three quarters. And I'm very excited about what we've got in the pipeline going forward. I think as I said at the opening of my comments, the absolute key for us is going to be to execute. But I think if we execute and, again, we stay really sharp with the proposition that we're offering customers, I don't see any reason why we couldn't sustain that performance, but it's on us to demonstrate it.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: And then, Jeff, regarding your question on kind of China, Hong Kong going forward, it'll be accounted for similar to how we account for Japan today, which is we'll get a royalty up in franchise revenues, and then we'll pick up 20% of their net earnings down in the line called equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates within our other operating income. So that's what it'll be beginning \u2013 I guess, a little bit beginning this quarter, but really beginning more next quarter. And then, regarding size of it, I guess, what I would remind you of is remember that China and Hong Kong in total were less than 5% of our consolidated operating income.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: So we have time for one more question and that will be David Tarantino with Baird. David?\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. My question is on your digital strategy. And, Chris, maybe you can comment. I think you mentioned that there's a building database of digital users. I wonder if there's any metrics you can share around that and where you expect that to go over time. And then, lastly, on the mobile order and pay adoption, specifically, I know it's early days, but can you talk about the adoption rates you're seeing in the restaurants you've had it the longest, and what you're planning to do to drive adoption as you move through next year? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. Well, so I'd say we are still in the early innings, in honor of the World Series, in the early innings of digital, but we're seeing, I think, a really nice start to it. So we've had almost 30 million downloads. I would say we're roughly 9 million active users, meaning who are in it on a monthly basis that we're seeing there. And we're seeing strong offer momentum, which is really currently the primary benefit that we're delivering through the app. As we're rolling out now mobile order and pay, the power is going be that to then bring together the offer with the ability to do mobile order and pay. Right now, what we're doing mostly in our restaurants with the roll out of mobile order and pay is we're really at this point focused on getting the operations right. So getting, for example, the crew to understand when a curbside order comes up, how do they take that order, how do they go out and bring the food to the customer. So, right now, I'd say we're spending a lot of time on mobile order and pay. Yes, as we're deploying it, but really make sure we've got the operational muscle there, because what will happen then in 2018 is we're going to flip the marketing switch on it and start to drive really much more increased usage. But, certainly, we've learned from some of the other activity out there. We want to make sure that we're ready when we do flip on the marketing switch that we're ready to handle the business with it, but still early innings. We do think that it's a significant opportunity for us and we would expect in the future it becomes a more significant part of the comp.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: So we've reached the top of the hour. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing remarks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. Very briefly, our Velocity Growth strategy is working. And you can see the proof in our performance. Even as we've made a lot of progress, we know we still have a lot more to do. We'll continue focusing our energy on aligning our entire organization around disciplined execution that will allow us to deliver on the full potential of our plans. And with that, thank you for dialing in, and I wish you a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, driven by guest count growth. We grew global comparable sales 6.6% and global guest counts 3%, resulting in strong earnings growth. This demonstrates the progress we are making with our business today. Our strength was broad based, as we grew sales and guest counts in every one of our top nine markets for the first time since 2008. Here are just a few highlights from around the world to illustrate this momentum. Italy experienced its best quarter guest count since 2010. In April, the UK saw the highest monthly sales volume in its 43 year history. Germany had its strongest quarterly comp sales in nearly 10 years. Canada's sales growth was the highest in the last five years. And in the Netherlands, a market that's becoming a more meaningful part of our overall business, we had our best comp sales and guest counts in more than 20 years. Our most important priority remains growing guest counts by serving more customers, more often. This is the ultimate measure of our turnaround as we strengthen and grow the business. We've talked before about the extensive research we conducted that gave us a much greater appreciation for who our customers are and what appeals most to them. Guided by that insight, we're taking purposeful actions to retain customers who visit us today. We've gained lapsed customers and convert casual customers to committed customers. Our second quarter results demonstrate that customers are responding as we serve hotter, better-tasting food, offer convenience on their terms and provide good value for their money. We'll spend more time today discussing the moves we are making in each of these areas that are driving growth around the world. First, though, I'll ask Kevin to discuss our second quarter sales performance in more detail.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks. Since Steve outlined the strength of our global top line results, I'll provide a little more texture on how each of our segments contributed to our global performance. In the U.S., comp sales were up 3.9% for the quarter, as we benefited from the recent value and premium offers layered on the menu and operational initiatives over the last couple of years. And while the environment in the U.S. remains very competitive, we're pleased with our comp sales gap for the quarter of positive 3.5% versus our QSR sandwich competitors, a good indication that we're beginning to make headway on regaining customers. Sales trends in the International Lead markets remained strong, with comp sales up 6.3% for the quarter. The UK continued its momentum, reaching its 45th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, while Canada and Germany also had strong performance in the quarter. The results delivered by the well-established markets in this segment are a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the McDonald's brand. In the High Growth segment, comp sales grew 7%, with positive results across the entire segment for the third consecutive quarter. China's continued momentum was the strongest driver in this segment. And the Foundational Markets had the largest percentage sales increase, posting comp sales growth of 13%, led by Japan's double-digit comp sales, along with strong results in each of the segment's geographic regions.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. This reinforces that we are driving strong results around the world from our larger, more established markets to those that are still emerging. As we look at what drove performance, let's start with the food we serve. We're strengthening our existing menu while responding to shifting tastes of our customers. Premium platforms pioneered in our European markets have become a standard on menus across our entire top markets. This is testament to our ability to share and scale ideas throughout McDonald's. For example, in the U.S., we launched our Signature Crafted line at the national level featuring great-tasting sandwiches with premium toppings like pico guacamole and sweet barbecue bacon. In China, we introduced Chef Crafted burgers made with recipes from a Michelin Star Chef. The more convenient we make it for our customers to enjoy McDonald's, the more they reward us with their business. Experience of the Future, or EOTF, as we call it, fundamentally changes the way customers interact with our brand. We are providing an experience that is more personal and less stressful, matching our best people with technology platforms like self-order kiosks, digital menu boards and table service. Changes in the layout of our dining rooms and service areas create better customer flow and give us the ability to enhance our McCaf\u00e9 and dessert business. Poland was our EOTF incubator market. On a recent visit to celebrate the market's 25th anniversary, Kevin and I experienced firsthand the big difference it makes for customers when our restaurants introduce and integrate all Experience of the Future elements at once. We've talked quite a bit about Canada and their best-in-class Guest Experience Leaders. The market continued to enhance and build on the program with table service. And customer satisfaction scores are up significantly over the past two years. As we continue to streamline the sharing of good ideas, we've taken what we've learned in places like Poland and Canada to other markets. Italy, for example, converted many of the local restaurants in Milan and Catania to EOTF. It's making a difference for customers and for our business. Comparable sales and guest counts in those Italian cities are above the market averages and in line with the mid-single digit sales lifts that we have seen in other markets that have made progress with EOTF deployment. Shifting the conversation, we're also giving customers more reasons to visit McDonald's more often with locally-relevant value. In the U.S., we launched a nationwide cold beverage value platform as we head into the summer. Guests came in more often for $1.00 any size beverages and $2.00 McCaf\u00e9 drinks, which included popular smoothies, shakes and blended coffee drinks. In France, McFirst is an affordable lunch on-the-go that has been popular with our customers. And in Australia, more customers have been visiting McDonald's as a result of our $1.00 Hamburger. This complements some of our bundled value offerings on the menu and makes it more affordable to feed a family. I'll turn back to Kevin now so he can share insight on how all of the moves we are making are impacting our bottom line.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: In addition to the strong comp sales and guest counts, we've strengthened our operating results as well. Operating income grew by more than $430 million for the quarter, benefiting from last year's results that included impairment and restructuring charges. Even without the charges, our income grew by more than $200 million as a result of strong restaurant operating performance and G&A savings across all segments. At the same time, flow-through to our bottom line earnings was strong. Excluding the impact of current and prior-year strategic charges, earnings per share were up $0.28 or 21% in constant currencies. The biggest component of our income is franchise margins, which represent about 75% of total restaurant margin dollars. Our franchise margins are increasingly being driven by a relatively steady and predictable stream of rent and royalties. And in the second quarter, the margins grew to over $2 billion, an 8% constant currency increase. Company-operated margin dollars were relatively flat for the quarter, while the company-operated margin percent increased 160 basis points to 18.7%. Both the margin percent and dollars reflect the impact of China's strong comp sales as well as the benefit of no depreciation expense for China and Hong Kong in 2017. As I mentioned in the first quarter, we stopped recording depreciation for both markets once they were classified as held for sale. China's benefit to consolidated margin dollars was offset by the impact of refranchising in our U.S. and Foundational Markets. In the U.S., company-operated margins declined 30 basis points to 16.5%, as positive comp sales were offset by higher labor costs. These higher costs were due to both higher wages and purposeful investments that we've made to ensure that we execute at a high level and provide a great experience for our customers as we deploy mobile order and pay, accelerate the roll-out of Experience of the Future and ready the system for the introduction of fresh quarter pound beef patties next year. Regarding other pressures, we continue to effectively manage commodity costs. In the U.S., costs for the second quarter were relatively flat versus last year. We still expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year, with more pressure in the second half of the year as we lap meaningful commodity benefits from the second half of last year. We're also closely monitoring key inflation indices to ensure that we maintain our value proposition while strategically taking price increases. Our second quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 1.8%, which was below food away from home inflation of 2.2%. For the International Lead markets, commodity costs were up about 1.5% for the second quarter and our menu prices were also up about 1.5% year-over-year. Turning to foreign currencies, for the quarter, foreign currency translation hurt our results by $0.03 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect the impact of foreign currency to be positive $0.01 to $0.03 in the third quarter and $0.00 to positive $0.02 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year. Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to provide an update on the China, Hong Kong refranchising transaction. I'm happy to report that we expect to close this important strategic transaction in the coming weeks. With its completion, we'll reach our global refranchising target of about 4,000 restaurants more than a full year ahead of our original targeted time line. In addition to the China, Hong Kong transaction, we've completed several other important refranchising transactions since November of last year including Singapore, Malaysia, the Nordics and Taiwan. As I mentioned earlier this year, our key P&L growth rates for 2017 and 2018 will be choppy as a result of this refranchising activity. From an EPS standpoint, we expect limited long-term impact from these transactions, as we plan to use the cash proceeds to repurchase shares. However, due to the nature of the weighted average shares outstanding calculation, we anticipate a negative impact of a few cents per quarter through third quarter 2018. And while these refranchising transactions will have a dilutive impact on our revenue and operating income in the near term, these transactions are immediately accretive to our free cash flow, as we'll be operating under a less capital intensive model that delivers a more stable and predictable revenue stream. We expect to return to revenue growth and achieve our long-term targets beginning in 2019, as our strategic partners invest and unlock the potential in these markets through unit expansion as well as sales-building initiatives. Our refranchising strategy has been a key part of transforming McDonald's into a more purposeful, more stable and more efficient organization focused on delivering more growth. Further details on the impact of these refranchising transactions on our future operating results is provided on our website.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. And this demonstrates that the retain, regain and convert foundations of our Velocity Growth Plan resonate with customers and drove top and bottom line performance for the quarter. Now, I'd like to talk about the progress we're making with our plan accelerators, digital, delivery and Experience of the Future in our U.S. restaurants. These new platforms for growth build on our foundation and enhance or accelerate everything else we're doing for the customer. They bring the biggest benefit to the most people in the shortest possible time. And we're making great progress with bringing the accelerators to a growing number of restaurants. Having said that, they are different from, say, our All Day Breakfast launch. This was an extension of our popular Breakfast business and drove an immediate increase in sales. Our velocity accelerators provide new ways for our customers to experience McDonald's. It will take time to build awareness, which is the initial step forward toward changing customer behavior in a way that will be meaningful for our business. We remain confident and know these initiatives increasingly will prove to bear competitive advantages, unlocking growth in our business. With digital, we see a clear opportunity to provide an even higher level of convenience and personalization for customers on their terms. To do that, our current priority is mobile order and pay. We are on track to make mobile order and pay available in 20,000 restaurants worldwide by the end of 2017, including our 14,000 restaurants in the U.S. As part of a sequence roll out, we brought mobile order and pay to more than 5,000 restaurants around the world. Whilst we're in early days, we're seeing higher average checks and the curbside pickup is a convenience that customers value and thus, enabling us to grow capacity at peak times. Delivery illustrates our ambition to redefine convenience for our customers. In the U.S., during the month of January, we piloted delivery with a couple dozen restaurants in Miami. The initial tests went well and we've moved quickly to expand. We've now scaled this initiative by launching delivery at more than 4,000 restaurants in markets from the U.S. to Australia. Delivery also shows how McDonald's can leverage our size and scale, as nearly 75% of the population in our top markets are literally within three miles of a McDonald's, giving us an unmatched advantage in bringing great-tasting food to customers quickly. In each of the markets where we've launched delivery this year, our size and scale has provided an additional advantage. We've been able to partner with the strongest third-party operators, like UberEATS, to pick up food from our restaurants and deliver to our customers. We're encouraged by the results we've seen so far with expansion of delivery. They give us confidence there's meaningful opportunity with the customers we want to regain. And we've only scratched the surface. In many of our markets around the world, we're seeing average check sizes between 1.5 and 2 times higher than our overall restaurant averages. And in most of our markets, we're utilizing our location advantage and operational efficiencies on customers' orders, getting food from order to doorstep in an average of less than 30 minutes. With 60% of orders being placed in the evening or late nights, we're seeing an opportunity to serve more customers during some of our slower periods. This expansion of delivery is in addition to the 3,500 restaurants, primarily in Asia and the Middle East, where we've been in the delivery business for over 20 years. So we're now offering delivery in almost 8,000 restaurants, in 47 countries, across six continents. The progress in our business is also the result of the changes we've made to our organization. We're fit for purpose with the right structure, right talent and right mindset. We have fundamentally transformed our culture. We're behaving like a leadership brand. We have global cross-functional teams collaborating with a sense of urgency to achieve a common goal. And we're applying our learnings on-the-go. And nowhere is that more evident than the work underway on delivery. We are scaling faster than ever before. Now, as we scale, we're applying learnings from our best performers across all our delivery markets. And tomorrow, we're going to celebrate our progress and have some fun, too, during our Global Delivery Day. There'll be events taking place around the world in select markets for both our customers and our employees. So feel free to join the fun by placing your own delivery order tomorrow. As you know, the third velocity accelerator is rolling out Experience of the Future in the U.S. Taking advantage of learnings around the world, we're bringing EOTF to customers in the U.S. with greater purpose and pace. The U.S. team devoted a lot of work to building a compelling version of the Velocity Growth Plan, and they call it the bigger, bolder Vision 2020 for their market, while U.S. leaders have worked closely with our Owner/Operators to share their vision for transforming the experience for McDonald's customers. In addition to taking them through our Velocity Growth Plan in the West Loop of Chicago, we sent each U.S. Owner/Operator a letter detailing the company's commitments to them and laying out what commitments we expected in return. While we give the Owner/Operators until October to commit to the plan, I'm pleased to share with you that more than 85% have already signed on. So getting our Owner/Operators on board three months ahead of schedule is now allowing us to move even faster to gear up for execution. We're moving ahead toward our 2,500 EOTF restaurants in the U.S. this year and are preparing for a faster pace of deployment for 2018. We will continue sharing our pace as we redefine the experience for our customers with our velocity accelerators. We have always prided ourselves on continuous improvement and now we're doing it at an even faster pace. That is what makes me most confident about McDonald's. We have strong leadership across our business. We're generating solid momentum. We've only started acting on the Velocity Growth Plan and early results validate that these initiatives are the right ones to accelerate our growth. We committed to pushing even harder and faster moving forward. And with our customers front of mind, that's just what we're doing. Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Mike to lead the Q&A.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Steve. We'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. In addition to Steve and Kevin, we also have Lucy Brady, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, joining us for the remainder of the call. Now, our first question is from David Palmer with RBC.\nDavid Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Just a quick clarification, first, when you do UberEATS today and you're going to be doing mobile order in the future, will those two be linked in some way? In other words, could you initiate a delivery from your app and perhaps tie it in with rewards in the future? And then, just a follow up on your leadership markets, those were very strong. You listed some top-performing countries and some initiatives, but if you could talk a little bit about what perhaps promotional noise or other quarterly noise and what sort of truly sustainable momentum picking up we are seeing in some of these leadership markets. Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. Thanks, David. So quickly on the UberEATS and really with all the third-party operators that we have entered into relationships with around the world, they all fully understand that as we develop our app, that customers will be able to route their delivery order through our app onto their third-party platforms. And, thereby, as we develop our digital capabilities, any form of CRM loyalty will come with that. So, yes, we've been mindful of that and very transparent with our partners. And that'll further strengthen the experience for the customers. For ILM, I wouldn't say there is anything particularly tactical in the quarter that created that performance. What I would say is we're seeing now the ongoing benefit of the EOTF platforms as we continue to roll out across those markets. The UK is going to be approaching, by the end of the year, more than 1,000 restaurants converted. Australia is almost fully converted; Canada substantially as well on their first version of EOTF; and France and Germany working very hard as well to accelerate. What we're beginning to see now, though, is the critical mass of markets beginning to generate that sort of mid-single-digit type uplift over and above the market averages. And I want to put this into the context that we are not seeing any tailwinds, whether it's economic or competitive, in any of those five markets. They're all incredibly competitive. It is a market share fight. So we're still being very competitive on value. Yes, we want to drive customers in. We don't get a pass on value. We don't ever want to or expect one. So what we're seeing is the more customers we drive into our restaurants or through the drive-thrus, the more they begin to see and appreciate the improvements we've made in the business over the last two to three years. So I'd say broad-based in confidence, but there are still economic challenges and macro challenges through France and Germany. We're having to battle hard, but we're focusing on market share and continuing to invest in those competitive environments.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I have a two-part question on the UberEATS delivery program in the U.S. You guys ended the quarter with the service available at about 25% of U.S. locations. And I was curious. What are the common traits of stores that are seeing the most success with it? And then secondly, what's the limiting factor to how fast you can add stores to the platform? Is the speed determined by where UberEATS has the penetration or is speed determined by what markets you feel most comfortable adding capabilities? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Do you want to take that one, Lucy?\nLucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.: Sure. I can go ahead and take that. In terms of where we are seeing some of the common characteristics of success, look, we're in the early days. We're digging in. We do see some variability. Stores near college locations tend to do much better than others. I also think we're seeing some things in lower socioeconomic areas, in downtown areas or places where people don't have access to cars, also being a driver of success. But we're really getting in and understanding. I think overall, one of the things we're pleased with is that we are seeing strong demand from our customers, that, as they become aware of the delivery, they're actually trying and then they're having a great experience, in many cases, better than they expected. And then, we're seeing really good repeat rates. And so the focus for us is about building the awareness among the customers and then the rest will take care of itself. And then, in terms of how fast we scale, I think that is really dependent on the growth and the demand that we're seeing and then working very closely with UberEATS to understand where they have capability in their markets, and then working together jointly to prioritize where we might go together for expansion above and beyond their existing markets.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: And, Andrew, just to further support that, Lucy's absolutely right. One of the beauties of the broad-based expansion of this is that markets are learning from each other. So they're having fun, on particular, whether it's days of the week or particular event days and how do we maximize the opportunity for people who are maybe at home watching, there could be a big game or a big tournament on TV. And, therefore, delivery plays a much stronger part. And also, as Lucy says, I know the UK pretty well. And some of the strongest performances are absolutely in some of the slightly tougher parts of town, and particularly late at night and overnight, where people are much more comfortable having food delivered to them than necessarily venturing out. So we continue to learn and that helps guide us as we do our planning, but also at a restaurant level to helping coach and train our Owner/Operators and our restaurant managers what to expect in sort of volume patterns. So this is a rapid learning environment, and we're enjoying being on the journey.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Yes, thank you very much. I did want to also ask about two follow-ups, if I may, Experience of the Future and then also on delivery. So on the delivery piece, is there an opportunity to maybe lower the delivery cost that UberEATS charges the customer? Just because if I think about McDonald's scale, you're probably the only company out there that can compete with the pizza restaurants in terms of speed of service and the cost of the ticket, but maybe the delivery fee is high and potentially a hurdle, so any color you could give us on the economics or whether there's an opportunity to even improve the value proposition further. And then, I wanted to ask on Experience of the Future, the remodel, in combination with EOTF, gives like, I think, a 6% to 7% comp lift. Can you just give a little bit of color on Experience of the Future alone? I know Steve said that it's a slower ramp potentially than All Day Breakfast, but that's still a healthy lift in my mind. Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Maybe Lucy wants to offer up the UberEATS question. I'll take EOTF when Lucy's done.\nLucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.: Great. So, Sara, to your question on the customer delivery fee, absolutely we're always looking at ways that we can deliver great value to our customers and are testing, together with UberEATS, on different models. In the UK, the delivery fee of \u00a32.50. In the U.S., it's $4.99. And we're really trying to get in and understand the consumer demand elasticity. So we're very much focused on that. And as we learn and understand the customers' willingness to pay, we'll absolutely make sure we're working together to maximize the value for our customers.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: So, Sara, on EOTF, so it's a good question that maybe I could better clarify. The slower ramps-up is when we're introducing a new platform which is changing consumer behavior. So delivery and some of the digital initiatives like mobile order and pay, where consumers have got so used to experiencing McDonald's in a certain way, getting them to change those behaviors takes a little while. With EOTF, though, what we tend to see in that kind of mid-single digit; I wouldn't necessarily say 6% or 7%. Let's just call it mid-single digit. Once the restaurant is transformed \u2013 it may close for 10 days, close for 12 days while the reinvestments and all the elements are being introduced \u2013 we see a pick-up almost immediately. Within that first four to six weeks, we just see customer curiosity, word-of-mouth, local launch events where we create some fun around it because it transforms a restaurant both internally and externally. So we see EOTF kick in much quicker. And the point I was making about the slower build was really more about these kind of new platforms of growth, which we think have years' worth of growth ahead of them and it will slowly ramp up. Clearly, the more powerful we can start, the better, but the reality is consumers have got used to us, operating with us and experiencing us in a certain way for a fair bit of time and just changing those behaviors just take a minute.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape in the U.S. and also how you're thinking about your layering of initiatives? Obviously, you started to talk a little bit more excitingly about coffee at the Investor Day. Just how should we think about what your next 12 to 18 months should look like between value, core, newness, as well as the EOTF drivers? Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: So I guess from a competitive landscape, I mean, it's a market share fight. I mean, everyone's working hard to up their game. So I'm certainly not going to comment on any individual competitor, but the fact that we've begun to open up that gap versus these sandwich competitors certainly gives us encouragement that we are certainly regaining those customers that we acknowledged on the 1st of March, that we had lost over a handful of years previous or some of these customer visits, I should say. So our gain will result in pain being felt elsewhere. And others will decide what they disclose on that. In terms of next steps, I think we've been pretty transparent about our plans, to be honest with you. I mean, clearly, we've got a substantial amount of restaurants that we want to introduce the full Experience of the Future to across the U.S., 14,000 restaurants, which we'll certainly look to by heading into 2020. But also the other initiatives, we're still only a quarter into the estate on delivery. We have only just over \u2013 I say just, but we got that 1,300 restaurants in the U.S. on mobile order and pay, with some interesting learns from the consumer pick-up, but again, we want to drive behaviors that way. Certainly, when I spoke to the commitment letters, if you like, which was kind of a really bold and brave plan that was co-crafted with our U.S. leadership team and our Operator leaders as well, we now have good visibility into internally, of course, into what our next three years looks like and what's going to underpin those plans. And certainly, one thing that the company is committed to, and our Owner/Operators is also, is to remain competitive on value throughout that period. So no matter how the landscape changes, whether it's on commodities, whether it's on inflation, whether it's on the economy in general, consumer confidence, we are committing to remain competitive on value as well. So it is going to be a multi-dimensional growth plan, some just through the core improvements in how we operate our business, the day-to-day operations. And we didn't speak much about it in the prepared comments, but there's still an enormous focus on delivering just great QS&C day-in, day-out. Our Owner/Operators are committed to it. We analyze deeply the consumer feedback we get from the Voice, which is a kind of a real-time feedback loop we get these days. And we can never underestimate the importance of clean bathrooms, friendly service and serving hot, fresh food. So we're looking to operate on all levels and excited about the energy we have in our plans, along with the Owner/Operators, for next three years and beyond.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Steve, you just mentioned a little bit about this, but I was wondering if you could give an update on speed of service, which has been a hallmark of McDonald's. And I think you've taken a step backward on your speed in the last couple years. So just wondering if you could give an update on where you are on that, if there's a big effort to improve the speed of service in the system operationally and then, perhaps, talk about how some of the digital initiatives tie in to the opportunity there.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. Very fair question, David; speed of service, the absolute time, has gone backwards a little bit over the last, well, fair period of time, to be honest. Interestingly, customer satisfaction and the service scores in customer satisfaction have improved. So whilst that doesn't mean we're not mindful of the speed, we obviously need to remind ourselves it's not all about the speed. That said, we want both. So what you'll see with a lot of the elements that we introduce through the broader Experience of the Future and the digital programs are aimed at smoothing out the congestion points, the pinch points in the McDonald's experience. So everything from if people want to pay through technology, whether it's through the Apple Pay feature or through credit, debit card, that shaves seconds off the payment process. If they want to order in advance, through mobile order and pay or away from the front counter, the self-order kiosk, that again helps the congestion during the peak periods. And also, just the customer flow, we're very mindful. Again, we don't talk a lot about it on these calls, as we reinvest in the restaurants and the dining areas, we're very mindful that the customer flow from when they enter through the doors, either go to the kiosk, go to the front counter, how that interacts with table service, how can we smooth that whole experience to eliminate, as you say, the pinch points. So the technology absolutely will underpin our ability to shave seconds, and ultimately tens of seconds, off their service time. But at the moment, the customer is giving us positive feedback on the broader service experience. As I say, we're not satisfied with that. We want the friendliness as well as the speed, so we're working hard at it.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next call is from Greg Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Just one quick one on the incrementality of delivery orders, how incremental are they today? And where are the orders coming from? Are they coming from other quick service restaurants, just the industry more broadly or from food at home occasions?\nLucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, Greg. It's Lucy. I'll take that one. I think the short answer is we believe right now it is highly incremental. Our initial estimates are north of 70%. And in some cases, even more incremental than that, with a lot of the demand, as Steve alluded to earlier in the prepared comments, coming at under-utilized dayparts, with 60% after 4:00 in the evening. In terms of where we're sourcing the volume from, I would say it's a little bit too early to tell specifically. But what we're starting to hear from customers is that it's really a new occasion that they're coming to McDonald's for. Instead of eating at home or going to other quick service restaurants, they're choosing to come from us. So some of our initial data is that we're tapping into a different use case for delivery, a different demand occasion that we weren't able to access before just through our restaurant and drive-thru business. So we're excited about that potential.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well, just to add to that as well, one element, and again, this is somewhat anecdotal, but through the conversations we have with the third-party operators, it does also demonstrate what a great partner we are for them to have, because they're beginning to see a number of the McDonald's orders they fulfill are the customers who've newly downloaded their app. So we are generating traffic to their app, which clearly is great for them, and it also shows incrementality to us. But also, the business benefits them as well. So we've long had an established and strong partnerships, if you like, for our supply chain. It's part of the three-legged stool we speak about, so as well as them bringing value to us with the business that we generate in incrementality, clearly, we are very advantageous to them into introducing new customers to their platforms.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Thinking a little bit more into sort of value plans in the U.S., curious if you saw sort of any particular change in comp momentum in the U.S. when you had your national beverage value going versus not going, and sort of any updated timelines on when we might get more news on national value in the U.S., whether that be a more permanent solution or another six or eight week sort of promotion?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Okay. Karen. Well, you saw the comp momentum over the last number of quarters and momentum is starting to build. And I feel encouraged that we're at the level we're at in the U.S. It's a very big business and it's a very competitive business. And we know we had to be more competitive on value. Did we see a particular spike? Well, you can read the comp trends as well as I can. What was great for us, when we look at the regain element on the customer visits we had lost over the previous years, we knew a meaningful amount of those were through the value line, but what's more important isn't just that we're selling $1 drinks and $2 McCaf\u00e9 products. When we've invested the amount we have and our Owner/Operator investing the amount they have in the business, whether it's in core recipe improvements, whether it's in the service experience, whether it's in technology, it's great just to have more customers visit your restaurant to actually notice the investments we've made. So to me, value isn't just what it does to the trading performance, it's also what it does to the broader brand appreciation and getting more people back into our restaurants and seeing the changes we're making, taking notice. And it's no coincidence we launched Signature Crafted at the same time because when customers come in, they take a look at what's on the menu. They're curious, and they want to try it. It looks tasty, and they've enjoyed the premium platform as much as the value platform, but it's always the balance that's important. In terms of next steps, as I say, we certainly, the U.S. team and our Owner/Operators, are committing to stay competitive on value. And we certainly know that $1 drinks are working well for the summer. And they'll work on the plans through the back end of the year and into 2018. And when we've got something that we're willing to share, we certainly will do.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just two related questions on the cost side of things; one, just as it relates to the U.S. restaurant margin, I think consensus was in the 3% comp range with some expansion to margin. Actually, you guys delivered close to a 4% comp, which I think you mentioned included close to two points of price, and yet there was contracting margins. So I know you had mentioned some investments in mobile order and pay and Experience of the Future. I think you even said fresh beef for next year. I'm just wondering in this environment, what comp you would need to actually neutralize the margin, knowing you have those expenses coming or whether we should just assume that, in the current state, we should expect more pressure. And then my other related question was just on the G&A, because it did come in below our expectation. I was just wondering if you would characterize this as just a lumpy line item type quarter-to-quarter or with the refranchising, I guess, are you seeing greater savings perhaps than you had anticipated? Thank you.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, Jeff. I'll start with U.S. restaurant margins. As I mentioned in the remarks, a chunk of it was on the labor cost side, both in terms of wages and in terms of investments that we've made in order to make sure that we create the right experience related to things like digital, Experience of the Future, getting ready for the introduction of the fresh beef quarter-pound patties in the U.S. So some of those are investments that we're making that won't necessarily be long-term investments, but will be here for some period of time to make sure that we introduce these initiatives in the right way and kind of deploy them the right way in the restaurants. In comparison to the first quarter, if you will, our comp this quarter, about half of it was average check and about half was guest count growth. And so it was probably a little bit more balanced than first quarter was, which was primarily, or more driven, certainly, by check. If you recall, we actually were negative on guest counts, if you excluded the leap day impact, we're about flat on guest counts. So really all of that first quarter comp was driven by price, if you will, or check, whereas we like the balance certainly of growing guest counts and so you had a little bit more balance this quarter between guest counts and check. And we're certainly focused on margin dollars more than margin percent. And as we're refranchising, the McOpCo margin percent, I don't want to say becomes less meaningful, but is not the biggest focus, I'll say. Having said that, generally with all else being equal, if we didn't have these additional labor investments, we would have grown margin percent this quarter also. Regarding G&A, it is a little lumpy, I'll say, quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we saw some of the benefit being that we were lapping last year's worldwide convention. So that probably drove a little bit more of the percentage decline, if you will, or some of the percent decline this quarter. But in terms of on our plans for the year, we're pretty much in line with our plans to still have it go down by 7% to 8% in constant currency. So, so far what we've seen first half of the year is pretty much on plan related to the G&A timing.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, guys. I had a question about fresh beef. I wonder if you could talk about that decision to roll out fresh beef on the Quarter Pounder and how realistic it would be to roll out fresh beef across your entire line of burgers, if you were to decide to go that direction in the future.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. So I think Kevin and I both spoke to this on the last call actually, because we both visited the fresh beef test markets. And there was a genuine test market both in Dallas and in Tulsa. Kevin went to Tulsa. I was in Dallas. And the reality is we really had to very robustly test with the customer whether, effectively, the Quarter Pounder was tastier and juicier using fresh beef. And if that was the case, did it then warrant the operational and supply chain adjustment that come along with it. So we had a resounding yes from the consumer on this one. So we're now in the transition where we're making the adjustments through the supply chain, because, as you can imagine, our patty suppliers have to adjust both the way they prepare and then store and transport the finished product. So we're working our way through. We will have that supply in place into the second quarter of 2018 and we are feeling pretty excited that the customer is going to respond well to that. Oh, by the way, it's not just the Quarter Pounder, because we use the Quarter Pounder in the Signature Crafted premium platform as well. So the premium sandwich customers will also benefit from the fresh beef. As to whether we then extend that to the 10 to 1s, (47:29) time will tell. We look at our operating systems. We look at our capacity and capability to handle the fresh product. And we will see. We would always try and let the customer be our guide, but, at the same time, there's a lot of change that has to be absorbed at a restaurant level right now, which talks to Kevin's previous point about why we are purposefully investing labor and training and capabilities in our restaurants to handle the technology advances, Experience of the Future adjustments, the enhanced hospitality, all the way to fresh beef. So it's a balancing act for us, but the customer will always be our ultimate guide.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from the Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. Good morning. In your earlier comment about being committed to remaining focused on value and understanding that value can take on a bigger definition, are you talking about more or the same level of promotion? And then, just if you will indulge us, do have an opinion on the Amazon, Whole Foods conversation that's ongoing, maybe just generally speaking to meal kits at home and where you see that playing out? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: So, first of all, just to clarify on value, I think probably the best way I could say it is we are committing to remain competitive on value. If I said focus, I think a better word would be competitive. We're going to be competitive on value. We're not obsessed about winning on value. We're not sure if that's the best place to be, because we think we've got a lot more about our experience above and beyond value. But we commit to remaining competitive on value. With regard to Amazon, Whole Foods, certainly no comment on that particular announcement, but it just demonstrates how disruptive the business world is and how quickly it moves. And we continually challenge ourselves to be our own internal activists. Something I said very early on in my tenure and we've got the culture now running through our leadership teams, both in the markets and here in the headquarters, where we're continually challenging ourselves, knowing that the market's not standing still. And I think delivery is a great example of how we're responding to the rapidly-changing tastes and expectations of consumers. So it's an interesting world. And it's only going to start moving quicker. Whenever I've have the opportunity to meet fellow CEOs at occasional events, and I think that the one common observation all of us would make is that today is about the slowest the world's ever going to be moving at. It's only going to move quicker tomorrow. So saddle up and enjoy it because it's a frantic pace.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Kevin, you mentioned there's going to be some choppiness due to the sale of the China business in a few weeks in the coming quarters. A couple of questions; one is, is the appropriate time now to talk about what that transaction alone would mean to your operating margins in the business and maybe if it was appropriate to talk about the royalty rate in it? And forgive me if it's already in the website, I couldn't find it. But it would seem to me just based on our modeling, it would get you pretty close or maybe to your target of mid-40% raw operating margins alone, so maybe just correct that if that's a misperception. And separately on China, have they committed to doing the Experience of the Future? Is that part of that transaction or are they already on that path; maybe where are they are on the Experience of the Future? Thanks.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Do you want to take the China? I'll come back or do you want me to go?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: You go with the financial one. I'll come back...\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: I'll talk about the China, Hong Kong transaction. I'll give you a few headlines. I'm not going to go into all the numbers, because it is posted on the website. If you can't find it, you can call IR afterwards, and they can direct you to exactly where it is. But let me give you a couple of the key headlines from that. From a revenue perspective, there's about $4 billion \u2013 and this is the combination of all these transactions, the big transactions since November, which is China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Nordics and Taiwan. If you add all of those together, in total, there's about $4 billion of company-operated sales on an annual basis that are now going to be transferred, if you will, to franchise sales that we'll get a royalty on. So that's kind of the revenue side. At the same time, there's about $2.5 billion of sales that were originally classified as franchise, primarily conventional franchise, where we got a rent and royalty, that are now going to be developmentally licensed, so still within franchise sales, but converting from conventional to DL. So going from receiving rent and royalty to just royalty. Net-net on all of this, it's a little less than $300 million of operating income, which is a little less than 4% of our total operating income, that we will, I'll say, give up in the near-term. And that translates then into the EPS impact that I talked about in my script. At the same time, we'll save couple hundred million dollars of capital, so that free cash flow will increase. To your point, operating margin percent will increase. And we believe we'll be well set up, again, beginning in 2019, because in 2018, going up against some of this, you're not apples-to-apples. So 2019 will be the first kind of clean year of comparison, and that's where we set our financial targets beginning for that year.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: And I'll take the EOTF example. Part of the critical element of the partner selection was about that shared vision into the future McDonald's. And speaking on behalf of our partners, they absolutely shared our appetite to transform the McDonald's experience and the brand. So EOTF is proving to be \u2013 the customers are responding really well in China. I'll give you just one anecdotal piece of evidence of that. Where we've introduced it, the self-order kiosks currently have 30% utilization already. So you can see how the Chinese consumer actually embraces the technology and experience. It goes way beyond just EOTF. So, yes, they're committed to that, but also, they want to accelerate the broader digital players that we had. Yeah, they've got greater ambition than we'd already had established. They want to accelerate the openings. And also, the other growth driver we've spoken to, delivery, is proving to be a very influential part of the comp sales build in China and actually, is a greater part of the comp sales build in China than it is in any other market in the world. So they're actually at the front edge of a number of these trends, and our partners certainly, as I say, have a shared vision with us for that.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff? I think we lost Jeff. We'll take Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nUnknown Speaker: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. This is Jake (55:10) on for Matt. Just a few quick questions; one, on the digital side, can you provide any color on the overall percent of sales that digital makes up in the U.S.? And then within that, do you have a percent of sales that delivery takes up, or is it still too early to tell on that front? And then a quick follow-up.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well, I'll get you to the follow-up pretty quick, because we're not going to disclose either of those, Jake (55:36). First of all, it's early days. And secondly, it would be, at the moment, too commercially-sensitive for us to share that. That wouldn't make sense for us, so happy to take your follow-up. Then, I think we're heading towards the end of the call.\nUnknown Speaker: Okay. And then so lastly, you already provided a lot of color on the digital roll-outs and how that is all coming, but in the future, do you see the pace of these roll-outs kind of ramping up or it will be kind level year-over-year in the near future?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: On digital rollout, well, I think as we've seen with mobile order and pay, the reality is we want to get products into the marketplace where we can learn, improve, learn, improve, learn, improve, because we'll never have the perfect product. Technology doesn't work that way. So you would've seen (56:43) in March to our first restaurants here that were on mobile order and pay. We've now got over 1,300 in the U.S. And we're going to get to 14,000 by the fourth quarter. So you can start to see the ramp-up curve and its importance in those early weeks versus two to three months; getting the learnings, improve the product and then accelerate. So I think that's typically the sort of ramp-up curve you see in technology, which is get in the marketplace, learn quickly, be agile and then go hard at it. So I think you can see that's why we call them accelerators. These aren't initiatives that would fit into a normal annual planning cycle. That annual planning cycle is important for many elements of our business, but actually these initiatives work on a totally different timescale and we're trying to adjust our thinking and our culture to embrace that as well.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: So we have time for one last question, and that will be Jason West with Credit Suisse.\nJason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Just a couple questions; one, on the roll-out of EOTF, I know that in the U.S., you have a decent number of stores that need to be remodeled more generally. So is the plan to complete all those remodels as well as completing the EOTF or are you going to have situations where you're just kind of rolling in the EOTF elements, even though the underlying remodel hasn't happened? And then just a quick question on the delivery side, when you have delivery in some of these Asian markets that you've been in for years, can you just talk about what the potential mix is in some of those markets in your historical sort of averages?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, Jason, so I'll take EOTF. It's a great question. We want to introduce the Experience of the Future into a remodeled restaurant. So those that need remodeling, the entire work would happen at once. Our learnings from around the world is that has a far greater impact when you relaunch with all elements at once. For the customer, notable change really does give you that kick up in sales. So absolutely it's a fundamental part of the roll-out, be to remodel alongside the EOTF elements.\nLucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, and then to your second question on our delivery performance in Asia, what we've seen over time is really sustained growth on that business, with double-digit growth year-on-year off a strong base to the point where a lot of our existing restaurant in China, about 10% of their sales overall are from delivery, with our top-performing restaurants in some cases in the range of 20% to 40% even, so a very strong contributor to the business in Asia.\nMichael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Well, that's a wrap, folks. Thank you so much for your time and interest. We'll be signing off now.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Now before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong first quarter, with global comparable sales of 4%, marking our seventh consecutive quarter of positive global comparable sales. Globally, guest counts were up 0.6%, as customers visited McDonald's more in the first quarter of 2017 from the same period of 2016. And our bottom line performance was also strong. Diluted earnings per share increased 19% for the quarter in constant currencies. At our Investor Day, we talked about how we fortified our foundation and how we're now fit for purpose. Today, we're running better restaurants. We're keenly focused on operations excellence and on the fundamentals of quality, service, cleanliness and value. And it's making a difference for customers. Our greatest opportunities are at the core of our business. And we're continuing to gain momentum as we build a better McDonald's, one that delights customers with the taste and quality of our food, offers the highest level of convenience and provides great value. And as we shift from revitalizing the business to strengthening and growing it, we're going to talk about the moves we are making within the context of our Velocity Growth Plan. This will enable us to provide more texture on how the long-term plans we shared during our Investor Day in March are driving everything we're doing. So let's start by going deeper on our performance. And as we do that, we're going to change things up a little. Our leadership team has a great rapport and I'm especially grateful for the partnership of our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. And with that said, I thought the two of us ought to partner on this call like we do on a daily basis. So I'm now going to toss it over to him.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Steve. 2017 is off to a good start. We built upon strong prior-year results that benefited from the launch of All Day Breakfast in the U.S. and leap day, which created a 1% hurdle for this year's comparable sale across all segments. Our top line performance is also starting to reflect the emphasis that we're placing on growing guest counts, which continues to be our top priority. During the quarter, we saw varying degrees of success, with strong sales in guest count contributions from Japan, the UK, and Canada. Guest traffic is beginning to strengthen in other markets such as the U.S. and Germany, though their guest counts remained negative for the quarter. So before Steve walks through the steps we're taking to continue building momentum, let's take a look at first quarter sales highlights in each of our segments, starting in the U.S. We're in a stronger position in the U.S. today, a cumulative impact of the moves we've made the past couple of years. Comparable sales grew 1.7% for the quarter, fueled by ongoing customer enthusiasm for All Day Breakfast, the Big Mac promotion featuring the Grand Mac and Mac Jr, and our beverage value offerings. We also delivered a positive comp gap of 2.1% versus QSR sandwich competitors. In the International Lead segment, comparable sales increased 2.8% for the quarter, driven primarily by continued momentum in the UK and Canada's successful launch of All Day Breakfast. In the High Growth segment, comparable sales grew 3.8%, with positive results across all markets for the second consecutive quarter. China's continued momentum was the strongest driver of segment performance. And the Foundational Markets grew comparable sales 10.7% for the quarter, with solid results across the entire segment. Japan was the biggest contributor, with double-digit comparable sales on top of double-digit performance in the first quarter of 2016.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: So thanks for that, Kevin. Those are the drivers of the of the top line momentum in the quarter. I'd now like to turn to our strategy and the actions we're taking to sustain that momentum for the long-term, which we shared at our March Investor Day. Our Velocity Growth Plan is designed to grow guest counts by retaining customers who visit us today, regaining lapsed customers, and converting casual customers to committed customers, giving each of them more reasons to visit McDonald's more often. At the same time, we're creating the best experience for customers, leveraging our size and scale. We're prioritizing three velocity accelerators designed to drive growth on top of everything else we're doing, and those three are digital, delivery and Experience of the Future, or as we call it EOTF. Taken together, these actions enable us to bring the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time. So, today, I want to talk about the steps we're taking to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value. First, food quality; we know consumers place high value on taste. Serving delicious food is imperative. And as good taste and quality are so closely interrelated, we also continue to build on the moves we've made with cage-free eggs and sustainable beef to improve the quality of our food. Last month, we announced that we will serve fresh quarter pound beef patties prepared when ordered in U.S. restaurants by mid-2018. I had the chance to taste the burgers and talk with customers and franchisees in Dallas and Kevin did the same in Tulsa, and we both left convinced that customers will appreciate the improvement as we bring fresh beef around the U.S. As we expand our menu to offer premium burgers in markets around the world, we're tapping into our restaurant operations expertise to serve customers quickly and efficiently. We've recently launched Gourmet Creations in Australia, and we'll launch the Signature Crafted platform in U.S. restaurants next week. We're taking significant steps forward on what matters most to customers, and I'm confident it will make a difference for our business and our brands. Second, convenience; convenience is about making our customers' lives easier by providing a more accessible and personalized experience with a welcoming crew in a modern and inviting environment. In Canada, customers have come to rely on the hospitality provided by our Guest Experience Leaders, who welcome them in the restaurants and offer to guide them through the kiosk ordering process. Customers appreciate ordering at their own pace and customizing their order just the way they like it. And since their introduction in Canada, kiosk usage has more than doubled year-on-year. In the UK, we're providing greater convenience with increased access to McDonald's. More than 650 restaurants are now open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is such a huge benefit to consumers managing shifting work patterns and lives that are getting increasingly hectic and complex. We continue to highlight our extensive hours through the We Are Awake Overnight campaign, showing customers we're available on their schedule. Our leaner operating structure has improved our ability to spread our best ideas from one market to another. In markets around the world, we continue to see a collective lift from all the actions we are taking to make McDonald's more accessible and easier for customers to visit. Third, value; when value is customer-focused and locally-relevant, it drives guest counts, period. We're committed to providing great value, whether customers have a couple of bucks in their pockets or a few more than that. In the U.S., the predictability of our national beverage value program with $1 any size coffee was well received by customers. In Russia, we have seen increased traffic with our recently-launched all for 50 rubles value platform, which is a great value and highly competitive in that marketplace. And in Germany, our Taste of McDonald's campaign provides an everyday affordable mid-tier sandwich that is resonating with price-conscious consumers. We continue to tap into our unmatched scale and unparalleled operations to ensure customers feel good about what they get for what they pay. As I mentioned earlier, we're not stopping there. The world in which we and our customers live demands new approaches and an evolved mindset. Our three velocity accelerators, digital, delivery and EOTF, will drive incremental, profitable growth. They create more satisfying and lasting relationships with customers, transforms convenience, expands our dayparts and collectively help us become a better McDonald's. On digital, we are reshaping our interaction with customers, whether they eat in, take out or drive through. We'll bring mobile order and pay to 20,000 restaurants around the world by the end of this year. In the U.S. alone, mobile order and pay will be in 14,000 restaurants by the end of the year. Whilst we're still in the early days in our pilot markets, we're moving aggressively, with multiple mobile order and pay tests already underway. We're already in 400-plus restaurants across the U.S., including Chicago, Monterey, Salinas, Spokane and Washington D.C. And globally, deployment is underway in markets including the UK, Australia and China. Through delivery, we'll bring the McDonald's experience to more customers, whether it's in their homes, their dorm rooms, to their workplace and beyond. We're encouraged by our pilot results in Florida and are expanding to additional cities in the U.S. this quarter. At the same time, we're accelerating Experience of the Future in the U.S., building on our learnings from markets around the world. As we mentioned in March, EOTF will be in roughly 2,500 U.S. restaurants by the end of 2017, with a goal of converting most of the traditional restaurants in the U.S. system by 2020. Markets like the UK and Canada have reached a critical mass with Experience of the Future and are seeing growth in both guest counts and average check size, meaning sales lifts in the mid-single digits. And now, Kevin will share how our global growth plans are fueling the financial performance we've outlined for 2017.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: I talked about the strength of our top line results earlier. As Steve mentioned at the beginning of our call, our bottom line performance was also strong. Operating income grew by more than $250 million, or 16% in constant currencies. And earnings per share was up 19% in constant currencies. Let's dive into the performance drivers for the quarter and their impact on our financials. The increase in first quarter operating income reflects broad-based strength across all segments, a testament to our ongoing strategic initiatives. Over the last two years, we've enhanced the strength and stability of our business as we've evolved to a more heavily-franchised organization, with more restaurants now in the hands of our outstanding local Owner/Operators. This shift in our ownership structure also has reduced our capital and G&A needs going forward. And we are very focused on growing top line sales and profitable guest counts that directly support our critical revenue stream, as well as Owner/Operator cash flows. For first quarter, franchise revenues increased 7% in constant currencies, reflecting strong top line growth as well as the impact of expansion and re-franchising. Franchise margin dollars reached $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 7% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over 40% of the growth in consolidated operating income, led by results in the U.S. and the International Lead segment. Looking next to our company-operated margins, as we've said before, margins are a top line game. Positive comparable sales in the first quarter were a key contributor to our global company-operated margin growth. These margin results also reflect the benefit of lower depreciation expense of roughly $42 million, primarily in China and Hong Kong. As we indicated in our year-end report, in accordance with accounting rules, these markets were classified as Held for Sale, effective December 31. Accordingly, we stopped recording depreciation beginning January 1. We expect a similar benefit at least through the second quarter. Looking at the business drivers of our company-operated margins, we continue to glean insight from analytics to improve the effectiveness of our pricing models. Our intent is to optimize growth in guest counts, revenue and restaurant-level cash flows. At the end of the first quarter, our U.S. menu reflected a 2% price increase, which was below food away from home inflation for the period of 2.4%. Menu price increases for our International Lead markets averaged about 1.5%. As Steve has said, we have made substantial progress resetting our foundation and right-sizing our structure. In Q1, our G&A was down by more than $55 million, 9% in constant currencies, reflecting both the impact of our restructuring and re-franchising, as well as our ongoing spend discipline. We will continue challenging our G&A spend and optimizing our valuable resources to prioritize the funding of initiatives that grow the business The last item I want to call out for first quarter is foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02. At current exchange rates, we expect a negative impact of $0.02 to $0.04 in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.07 for the full year. As usual, please take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we progress through the year. We ultimately measure our financial efficiency by our operating margin, as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of our overall performance. As we move through 2017 and beyond, the execution of our re-franchising initiative will yield significant benefits to our operating margin as we transition to a more streamlined and efficient model. At the end of first quarter, we successfully completed the re-franchising of our Nordic markets. The regulatory processes to complete the previously-announced re-franchising transactions in Asia are proceeding, with the China, Hong Kong transaction expected to close in the second half of the year. And we recently completed a review of our ownership stake in McDonald's Japan and have made the decision to not proceed with the transaction at this time. Given our current ownership, McDonald's Japan restaurants are already classified as franchised, so this decision does not impact our current re-franchising target or our intent to evolve to 95% franchised over the longer term. It also does not impact our long-term financial targets that we introduced last month. Most importantly, we're confident that we have the right capabilities and customer-focused plans to grow our business in Japan, and we believe the market is poised to maintain its strong momentum. While our operating margin grew to nearly 36% for the quarter, items like the completion of the China, Hong Kong transaction and the related depreciation benefit that I mentioned earlier will create some choppiness in our operating margin over the next few quarters. So the near-term trend line for our operating margin won't be linear. Collectively, our re-franchising and G&A efforts, along with diligence in investing our capital to grow sales and income, will deliver increases to our operating margin and contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. I want to build on what you shared by providing some additional context around why we've never been more sure of our ability to seize the potential that we see. My confidence stems from the success we've already achieved and the world-class management team we now have in place to build upon the success. We've talked about our intent to blend individuals with deep McDonald's experience with new executives who have valuable experience outside of McDonald's and bring fresh perspectives and innovative thinking. With that in mind, we have recently brought on Bob Rupczynski as Global VP of Customer Relationship Management. Bob joins us from Mondel\u0113z International, where he was head of global media and digital. He previously led data-driven marketing strategies at Kraft. Linda VanGosen as head of U.S. Menu; most recently Linda was at Starbucks, where she was responsible for the overall vision and strategic growth plans for Starbucks Evenings. And Morgan Flatley as U.S. Chief Marketing Officer; she comes to us from PepsiCo, where she was CMO of Global Nutrition and previously returned Gatorade to growth as CMO of that brand. We're continuing to see great talent step into important roles. And I know that, together, we'll be successful in accelerating the growth of the business. The conversations I've had with franchisees, suppliers and, most importantly, customers have further bolstered my confidence. I visited with franchisees in the Middle East who have embraced the powerful potential Experience of the Future and seeing the impact it makes on the customer experience and their bottom lines. This is also an existing delivery market, so it was great to experience that first-hand. I've met with suppliers, including an Irish farmer participating in a national sustainability program. He's raising high-quality beef with a smaller carbon footprint and at a greater profit. Our leadership team has talked with nearly 4,000 Owner/Operators, company employees, suppliers, agency partners and bankers from around the world who have visited the space in Chicago where we announced our long-term growth strategy in March. In fact, Chris Kempczinski and his team have taken groups in 20 of our 22 U.S. regions through the space, walking through the series of experiences we set up to bring our future to life. They will take groups in the remaining two regions through next week. The feedback from franchisees has been overwhelmingly positive, with over 90% approval for the U.S. plans. And last, but certainly not least, as to long-time customers, recently in the Bay Area, as they tried and I tried, mobile order and pay for the first time and committed to use it time and again to order more of the delicious McDonald's food and drinks they love. I have no doubt the moves we are making are the right ones to build a better McDonald's, one that serves more customers more often. We're keen to continue strengthening the foundation that drove our strong first quarter results and, at the same time, pick up velocity and fuel long-term growth by focusing on those actions that bring the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time. So thanks, everyone, and now I'll turn it over to Mike to lead the Q&A.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Steve. We will now open the call for analysts and investor questions. Now, the first question is from David Palmer with RBC. David?\nDavid Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, good morning. Quick question on the non-U.S. business, particularly leadership markets, some of the informal eating out trends in those markets, you mentioned Germany, had some down traffic. But how does it look in markets like the UK? Some consumer companies have talked about weakness since Brexit there. And in some of these markets, what is the outlook that you see in terms of your ability to change trajectory, like in Germany where it seems like you've had an on and off again value message? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Hi, David. That's a good question. I'll do a quick run around all five markets in the Lead markets just to give you a flavor. Certainly, from what we've seen in the UK, our business has not missed a beat since Brexit. Now, that's not to say that as the process works its way through over a couple of years, that may translate to a consumer confidence, but certainly for now, we have not seen the business miss a beat. And, frankly, whilst others are slightly more hesitant, our Owner/Operators in the company are investing very aggressively in Experience of the Future and getting extremely strong performance, I've got to say, so feel really good about where the UK is at. France, very different situation; the macroeconomic situation there has been challenging for a while. We've struggled to get like-for-like sales growth. What I would say is green shoots of encouragement and credit to the team there. They have grown guest count in the last couple of quarters. So they're in a bit of a market share fight. The consumer is nervous, given some unfortunate and terrible terrorist activity, and now we're going through the presidential elections there. So there's a little bit of uncertainty there, but we're fighting hard to stand still at the moment, but I feel really good about where the business is at as the tailwinds return. Australia is a market where we've been very aggressive the last two or three years, with great results. The competition has woken up a little bit, so they're competing a little more, competing a little harder in the near term, so we're having just to adjust a little to that. But we're still getting solid growth. First of all, the alignment between a very aggressive positive-minded Owner/Operator group and a strong leadership team puts us in good place, but also we've invested really well in our restaurant estate and some of the modern elements of Experience of the Future. So, again, we're in good shape to go, but we're into a little bit more street fighting than we have been over the previous couple of years. Canada, their momentum just continues. They're doing a great job up there. And, again, very steady consistent planning year-in, year-out, is driving both strong guest count and strong sales growth. They are further down the Experience the Future rollout. So a little like Australia, Canada and the UK, we've got so many valuable learnings from how we built the growth plans there that we can bring back to the U.S. So the U.S. is very beneficial and is very open to that. And finally, Germany; Germany has always been a real tricky market. I mean, it exports things of high value, but the consumer in Germany is very value-oriented. And you see that across the grocery sector, as well as the broader informal eating out sector. So that whenever you come off value, you feel it immediately. So we've got a much more solid platform that is being developed for every day value, which I know the team are feeling a lot more confident about. We had a slow start to the year, in all honestly, in January. February, March, certainly got stronger. And we feel a lot better entering quarter two there in Germany. We're in good shape. So it's a good question. That sector is about 40% of our income, and the dollars we earn there are just as valuable as the dollars we earn in the U.S., which is a similar type number. I like to think of them as being our engine room and as well as an innovation hub for us as well. So I'm feeling good about the lead markets, and we're in good shape.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. I just have two bookkeeping questions and then a question. So the D&A, you said that it was going to continue at this level for Q2. Is that going to be also sort of for the full year? Should we look at this as a proxy?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Matt, that depreciation benefit keeps occurring until the transaction closes, until that China, Hong Kong transaction closes. So we don't know exactly when it'll close. That's why we say at least through the second quarter. Depending on when it closes, you know, you may see some or all of that benefit in the third quarter also, depending on the actual close date of the China, Hong Kong transaction.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Understood. Okay. And then the gap you said within the U.S. with your QSR peers, that was 2.1%. I'm assuming you are outpacing the peers by 2.1%? Or are you lagging the peers by 2.1%?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: No, we're outpacing the peers by 2.1%. Thanks for clarifying. Sorry if that wasn't clear. Yes, we definitely outpaced in the first quarter the QSR sandwich peers by 2.1%.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks for the question. With the Experience of the Future, you've talked about the mid-single-digit comp lifts based on the markets that you've already implemented this in. And as the store transforms and you install the kiosk, I guess the question is how quickly do these benefits materialize on the sales side? And when you do look at Canada, you actually mention that kiosk usage doubled year-over-year in the Canadian market. Is that like the dynamic at play here with the EOTF that drives the most incrementality? Is it mostly within the kiosk usage? Thanks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Hey, Brian, that's a fantastic question. And I'm trying to do a better job of painting the picture of why we feel so confident and excited about Experience of the Future. And I'll give you a comparison. If we have a new menu item launch or something like an All Day Breakfast, our history will tell us that you end up with a good surge initially the first handful of months, and then it settles down to a steady run rate. And we've seen that with All Day Breakfast and we're happy. With the three accelerators that we've identified, delivery, the digital and the technology side, and Experience of the Future, these start well, but have year upon year upon year upon growth. And let me give you an example. If we take kiosks \u2013 and that's why I really wanted to call it out in the comments earlier \u2013 first of all, it takes time for consumers' behaviors to change. So we need to get our hospitality programs very well established in a restaurant and customers have got to see a benefit. So initially, is it easier to order? Can it be easier to pay? Can you move away from the stress of the front counter? But now think one year's time, two year's time, when we've got mobile order pay. You can go in, they can scan their favorites. We'll have a better developed CRM, customer relationship management program with some form of loyalty and reward that comes with that. You'll be able to call up your personal profile on the kiosk. You can redeem points or redeem offers, for example. So to me, the basic functionality already helps customers. They appreciate it. It's a much more modern and less stressful experience. But actually, there is incremental improvement year upon year upon year. And, again, the best reference we have for this is what we've already got out there in the system. Self-order kiosks, for example, have been in the French market. I remember going there when I was back in the UK seven or eight years ago. They're now seeing way over half of the in-restaurant transactions go through the self-order kiosk. And at peak hours, it's almost all the transactions because people move away from the hustle-bustle front counter. So I think your point is very, very appropriate. And as we build out, this is why all these things are so important collectively. So as we build out our digital platform, build out the functionality of the mobile app, introduce mobile order and pay, then that interacts with the kiosk, which then interacts with our kitchens. It's actually a pretty complex program that seem to be working through the last couple of years. But to me, out of the traps, it grows transactions. It grows average check, but actually the beauty of this is it will keep on providing a platform of growth. So thanks for the question.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. How should we be thinking about the U.S. menu and the changes and the progression as you look to refine the value messaging? You talked about the rollout of Signature Crafted, and you've also recently discussed innovation. How should we be thinking about that from a modeling standpoint and from just your implementation as you run through net simplification? Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Brett. I won't try to help you think about it from a modeling perspective. I'll leave that to you guys. But the one thing we know, we have to be competitive on value, so Chris Kempczinski and the Owner/Operators fully embracing that. It doesn't mean you have to win on it, but be competitive certainly at the entry level. So if you've only got a buck or two in your pocket, there's something good for you at McDonald's. So that is always important. Then we want to reinforce and support the core menu. And don't underestimate the value of the core menu to us. We've got half a dozen multi-billion dollar brands within just the core menu. And most recently, we've seen the success we can have by supporting a Big Mac, having some extensions of that to create some fun. We had some fun with the Big Mac sauce, for example, and that creates familiarity with kind of our traditional menu. Then as we get better as a business, as the brands resonate increasingly with customers, we can explore more at the premium end and our credibility grows with that. So we feel good about Signature Crafted. This gives a variety of taste, different flavor profiles, more premium ingredients or unusual ingredients, in choosing guacamole, for example. And customers, we know, are willing to pay a premium for that at certain times. Then you also want to think about what is the role that the local Co-op plays versus national. So, that's another dynamic in the U.S. that's different to any other market around the world. So, we may want to compete with more local flavors and tastes in certain areas of the country. The Southwest will have a different flavor profile for promotional items than the Pacific Northwest, for example, or the Northeast. So that gives you a little bit of opportunity to create variety and just stay interesting to customers at a more local level. So, to me, this is all about balance. Yes, we want to have a strong value program. Yes, we want to play strong in the premium ends, but also our heartland is where us and our Owner/Operators earn most of their cash flow. So I'm feeling good that we will have menu innovation, but it won't be reckless. We cannot have too many items too often because that gets to your final point, which is simplification. And one of the things I have really enjoyed \u2013 well, hopefully, it's contributing to, but just witnessing across the U.S. team is they're getting increasingly confident about making fewer, bigger decisions. And that really helps the restaurant managers run restaurants better because there is less complexity. So all these dynamics play with each other, but menu, clearly, fundamentally, is a big part of our future.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, wonder if you can talk about the shift within your U.S. comp of traffic and average ticket over the past couple of quarters. I know you pushed $1 coffee and then the Mac Jr seemed to resonate pretty well among the guests here in the U.S. So I'm curious if you saw that transaction ever pick up quite a bit and if you feel that is something that's sustainable throughout the year?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I'll kick off and then maybe Kevin wants to talk about the pricing piece versus food away from home. I mean the one thing there's been really part of the honest conversations we have around the business, and you would have probably seen that at the Investor Day, was let's acknowledge the level of guest counts or transactions that we've lost because, frankly, we want those back. And an element of that is on the value side, but also an element of that is on the broader experience. We just make ourselves more inviting. So I would say we have fought harder on the value side the last three to four months. And I know the U.S. team and our Owner/Operators are embracing some aggressive value programs going forward, as well. And that has helped to narrow the gap between sales and guest counts. We didn't quite squeeze a positive guest count in the U.S. in the quarter. That said, we were up against a 1% hurdle, but, frankly, ultimately, our measure of success is full percentage points of guest count growth. So I'm not really worried about the tenths here and the tenths there, because that will underpin the long-term sustaining growth. So we have a very honest appreciation of what it is that we're looking to achieve here. And competing on value and broadening and enhancing our experience, we know will drive customer behavior.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yes, the only thing I'd add is, certainly, our intent is to grow both traffic and check. What you would have seen in the first quarter is average check grew partly from price, as I mentioned. We grew price less than food away from home, which is our long-term goal to make sure that we're kind of in that range in order to help drive guest counts. But the other benefit we also had in the first quarter was from a mix perspective. Certainly, things like the Big Mac promotion drove a better product mix than the year before, which helped drive that average check also. Thanks.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Steve, you mentioned that the franchisees are making the rounds through Chicago to take the Experience of the Future tour after we did in early March. And that the overall feedback is very positive, with a 90% approval around the plan. Just curious, though, for the franchisees who need further convincing, what reasons are they citing besides the cost of the program?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well, it's a good question, Andrew, because this gets to the core dynamics of what makes us different and we believe differentiates us in a positive way. Our Owner/Operator, remember, these are 20 year commitments. So the vast majority of Owner/Operators all have a long-term perspective. And that gives them the confidence and the encouragement to reinvest two to three times around that cycle to keep their business contemporary and in line. So I guess clearly and totally understandably, whenever you build bold confident plans that require some investment, that comes with an element of nervousness. I get that. And we all do. So, therefore, we try and demonstrate that we have the business case to support it. And also given we've got company-owned restaurants, we have skin in the game and we see that as well. I guess, to give you an example, there may be someone who is at year 16 or 17 of their term who will be wondering if they put that money in now, will they see that back in the remaining years or will they get that back if they're to sell all their restaurants. So each and every individual has a slightly different perspective on it, but I would say as an overall basis, significant enthusiasm. They love the idea of the U.S. going together on this, because the one thing that makes us powerful is whilst we respect and really cultivate the local Owner/Operator in their local markets and communities, and that resonates strongly, we know the brand McDonald's is strongest when 14,000 restaurants go together. And I think the confidence and the boldness of the plans that are being drawn up \u2013 yes, a little bit of nervousness, but that's just a normal human reaction. I think the excitement exceeds the nervousness by quite some way. So we feel we're at a really interesting and fun place at the moment.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. The question centers around the U.S. comps and one particular driver, but just on the comp in general, it seems like a lot of investors use the two and three year trends as a gauge to try and forecast. And I know there's a lot of concern going into the fourth quarter and first quarter of lapping the All Day Breakfast. But with the compares now easing, seemingly meaningfully, in coming quarters, just wondering is it not reasonable to assume a nice acceleration in the U.S. comp from that 1.7% level in the first quarter? Is there something we're missing, maybe to temper that enthusiasm just to try and kind of manage expectations as those compares ease? And separately, I'm just wondering if you can give any color on the delivery as an aside. I know you gave a lot of color on the mobile order and pay with digital and the Experience of the Future, but I don't think we have much in the way of the timing of the ramp of delivery and the potential contribution on that front. Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Jeff. In all honesty, I'm not going to give any forward-looking reassurance. That's not the way we tend to do things. I don't want to break that now. What we have tried to do is give you visibility into our plans. And that's what March 1 was all about, to demonstrate to you why we are confident in the long-term growth of the business. So we're doing a good job on the fundamentals. Let me give you another piece of texture around the U.S. and what I believe is helping to underpin some of our performance. Along with building exciting plans becomes a greater accountability for all of us who run restaurants, whether it's Owner/Operators or the company. We have been much more mindful. The U.S. team has been much more mindful about addressing the bottom quartile of performance, of operational performance. We're helping support, encourage and expect them to improve performance, but that has meant that some have left the system and those restaurants have moved into the hands of better Owner/Operators. So as you can imagine, that then helps underpin just core baseline momentum as well. So I just wanted to get that piece in there about accountability, day-to-day running great restaurants. And whilst we have great relationships, we're not scared of the honest conversations either. So that's important to stress. With delivery, we are in an interesting stage. As you know, we featured it at the Investor Day, so that was very mindfully done because it's one of our accelerators. We've had 200-plus restaurants in Florida now for a while, and we're encouraged about the start we've had. I would say similar to the Experience of the Future, it will start slightly lower and grow over time as we get better at it, as awareness grows and we put more marketing muscle behind it and customers begin to respond and change their behaviors. But that said, also, it would be fair to say we are not in test mode. We're expanding. And we're going to be expanding to a number of U.S. cities this quarter. But we're learning as we go. We're learning on delivery radius, on the in-store dynamic, on how we can capture the order better and prepare an order fresher, et cetera. So we are continuously learning. But, yes, we feel good about the way we're interacting with UberEATS. They've proven to be a good partner for us and, hopefully, we are for them. So we'll be expanding into a number of U.S. cities with UberEATS this quarter and demonstrating why we believe this is a velocity accelerator.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just one quick clarification on the U.S. traffic, I know you mentioned it was negative, but I was wondering if it was negative if you adjust for that leap day drag. And then, my real question is on the initiative to roll out fresh beef in the Quarter Pounder in the U.S. And I understand the consumer proposition, but can you talk a bit about the operational complexity or risk that that might add from a service speed, or however you think about executing that initiative? And then secondly, do you think this is a precursor for rolling out fresh proteins across the menu longer-term?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, I'll take the quick U.S. guest count clarification, and then Steve can talk about the fresh beef. As we mentioned, the U.S. was negative in the first quarter. To your point, if you adjust for the leap day effect from last year, it'd be relatively flat.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: And then on fresh beef, David, so we'd been in the market, particularly in Dallas, for a little over a year before we made the decision. We made the decision maybe three, maybe four weeks ago to say yes and to go with this. So we entered this with a very, I would say, a very open mind. We were excited about the opportunities from a customer perspective, but mindful of the complexity, cost, operational impacts, et cetera. So I would say we've been very well supported by the Owner/Operator groups, in particularly Tulsa and Dallas. We have worked through a lot of the kinks in this, so we believe this is very little incremental from a cost perspective. We did initially, in the early restaurants, see service slow down a little in the drive-thru, but we have found ways to get around some of those operational complications and brought that right back down to a negligible impact. There's a different food handling required, clearly, when you're dealing with fresh product than with frozen, but, again, with help from our suppliers, we've made the packaging very simple, the storage very simple, the food handling very simple. So there was an overriding call \u2013 I was getting letters from the Owner/Operators pleading for us to go with this. They believe they've overcome any in-restaurant issues that them and their teams had, but they were getting such an encouraging response from customers, because it tastes juicier. It's just hotter and juicier. It's a great-tasting product. So we feel good that we have vested that time, that one year, well to overcome any of the potential \u2013 and I think this is a good indication of the change of mindset that we have around McDonald's. There's plenty of yes-but conversations about how you could've, nice idea-buts. But we've gone to yes-and. How can we overcome it? And how can we make a difference? As to whether this signals a future, absolutely no idea. At the moment, we feel good about where we're at with Quarter Pounder. Given the volumes of Quarter Pounders we handle and the fact that that is our biggest patty, therefore, the biggest benefit transfers to the customer because that's where the juiciness and the heat really comes from. We feel good about that. We're going to roll the Quarter Pounder out over the next year or so, and we just look forward to seeing the results.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the food away from home and pricing topic, which is to say, historically, I think when we've seen inflation, McDonald's has actually done better at this, about widening this gap. And I guess I'm trying to anticipate if we look forward and we do see a bit more inflation, could you anticipate having maybe even, relative to the market, maybe again a little bit wider gap than even what you've already seen this quarter, in a good way? And have you thought a little bit about, you know, what the implications might be for traffic versus margin with respect to your franchisees' businesses? So that's my first question. And then, just quick follow-up, could you give the comp for China, please? Thank you.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: All right. Let me start with the pricing. As you mentioned, there are several things we keep an eye on as we think and look at pricing. Food away from home is one of the metrics we look at over the longer term to generally try and be below that metric. But as you know, we also look at food at home. And most recently, there's been a pretty big gap between food at home, food away from home. I think that gap is starting to narrow a little bit from the highs that we saw in 2016. But our philosophy on pricing really is to make sure that we're focused on pricing that will help drive traffic, as well as margins and Operator cash flow. So, you know, the Operators certainly are concerned about increasing profitability, as are we, but we also want to make sure that we're not taking too much pricing that discourages guests from coming in. We have a lot of models that look at the dynamics of this pricing, both within our menu and against competitors, and I think we're getting better with our analytics at looking at some of those metrics. But historically, as you mentioned, I think we have done fairly well with what I'll call some reasonable inflation, whether that's 1% to 2%. We've certainly shown an ability to adjust our cost base to address inflationary pressures. But I feel pretty good about where we are right now from the pricing standpoint. We were a little bit ahead last year of food away from home, and I think now we have adjusted appropriately. Regarding China, you know, I guess what I would say is while we're in the midst of this pending transaction with our strategic partners, I think out of respect to them and the process, we won't talk about a specific number. What I would say is our comparable sales were clearly higher than our near-in competitor in China, and I'll leave it at that.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Steve, my question has to do with just complexity around Experience of the Future as we walk through all the different elements of it. It seemed like this is a great consumer proposition, but it's a significantly more complex operation for the employees, meaning they've got to do delivery out to the curb, they've got to take orders from multiple points. What has been your experience early on in rolling that out? Do you have to add additional labor to the restaurants in order to \u2013 or training to the restaurants to get people over that hump of, sort of dealing with these different aspects? And do you have to think about who you recruit and how you recruit employees? It's a tight labor market, but maybe you need a different employee to interact with the consumer, given all the complexities.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Okay. Great question, actually, John. So scripting down to two or three different areas, I think you've kind of hit the areas that are important. So, yes, as we deploy Experience of the Future, there's a comprehensive training program that goes with that. And that's one of the things I think we're typically pretty good at. When we get into rollout mode, with the talent we have in the field, the operations experience, we do roll out these programs pretty well. But, yes, there's absolutely a training element to this. Additional labor, no, we're not seeing additional labor. What we are seeing is a reallocating of labor positions in the restaurants, and we need less people behind the front counter taking orders. And, you know, part of the significant benefit, both for us and for the customer on this, is we can repurpose them into the dining area. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the same people can do both roles. So what we're also seeing \u2013 and we've learned a whole heap from Canada, in particular, Australia, UK more recently \u2013 is there is a new role in McDonald's, and that's kind of the hospitality service person. So we have a dedicated job description for that. We hire specifically for that. Because it does require a different skill set. Those social interactions are different. And clearly, they will end up being busier, not just helping customers in and around the kiosk, but actually as we roll out table service as well. They will actually be delivering to food to customers' tables as well, so not additional labor, but repurposed. Is there training on rollout? Absolutely, yes, because that gives us the best shot of landing this well and making it smooth.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.\nJeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. I heard your response to Jeff's earlier question, and I recognized that mobile order and pay has been in test for only something like five to six weeks, but what is the plan for sharing performance updates on these test markets in coming quarters, meaning when this is a little bit more on its feet? At least from my perspective, I do think investors are very focused on this, and I'm curious how much information you guys will provide as we move through 2017.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Actually, that's a fair question, Jeff. At the moment, we haven't thought about sharing. This is early stages, but it is an accelerator for us, and we will want to give you some visibility, both in terms, say, the number of restaurants and the types of customer behaviors. Whether we give a precise number each and every time, I doubt that's where we'd head, but we want to give you an indication of whether this is enough to get excited about, but, you know, we have identified three accelerators. We do see them as changing the momentum of our business. So these aren't fringe things. These are platforms that we believe will grow and then grow year-on-year. So I think you will be getting more disclosure as we build up some critical mass, and we can start to help you interpret the numbers better and project forward.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore.\nMatthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, thank you. I have a question. At the March Investor Day, you outlined a plan in the U.S. to regain, retain, and convert customers, and that was built around quality, value, and convenience message that I think you already discussed on this call, but as you look at that inflection in the trend that you have, and I know it may not be very easy to quantify, I'm curious who you think you're actually bringing back, or who you've brought back this year in this inflection trend you've seen in the past few months, or even few quarters.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: If we're just talking about the U.S. specific, and I'm guessing that may be where the question is...\nMatthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Yes. Yes, U.S.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I think the regain is really largely around value. I mean, we saw that we were losing customers in the value end of our menu for a period of time. Retaining our stronghold is something that clearly we'll do through core menu and ongoing value, and experience, and convenience. We certainly saw some seepage of guest counts, if you like, at the value end. And I think the more competitive position we've taken, and our Owner/Operators have taken and embraced, has helped us recover some of that as well. Early days, very difficult to diagnose precisely, but as we saw the market share gains that Kevin outlined, and the 2.1% outperformance of our QSR peers, we know the combination of core menu, Big Mac extensions, $1 coffee, and then, as we exited the quarter, begun to move to $1 any size drinks. We know that combination resonated well.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: We have time for one more question, and that will be John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I was just hoping we could get just a view of the current labor market in the United States as it stands. Obviously, we're seven-plus years into an economic recovery. And this far in, sometimes the restaurant industry begins to see stress in terms of quality and availability and cost of employees, especially as turnover goes up. So how is the system kind of faring with that? Are there any plans, specifically in 2017 and 2018, for you to become even more of an employer of choice for this type of worker than you've been in the past, and just how are you feeling about things overall?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, John, it's a really astute point. I would say compared to three, four, five years ago, the general labor market is tightening a little bit, and, clearly, that is something we are mindful of. It hasn't really taken us by surprise, because we've seen economic cycles before. We know what that means to us. What you may have seen, for example, and part of our response to this, as well as we modernize our restaurants, as we introduce technology, we've become a more appealing place for people to work. And we believe that people in the service sector are more tempted to a modern McDonald's today than perhaps they would have done to a type of McDonald's of yesterday, but the other piece you may have seen is we've worked hard above the line on employer reputation, on jobs, on training, on skills, on education. So we talk about here in the U.S., in particular, being America's best first job. And that's something that we believe we can substantiate through opportunity, flexibility, pay and rewards, but also under the archways for opportunity programs you would have heard us talk about where we can help with high school diplomas and get our people into further education, where not only are we a job and not only do we help them pay the bills, but actually we help them progress in life and go to the next stage and build careers, either within or beyond McDonald's. So I think you're going to see the labor market further tighten. That's an expectation we certainly have. And you will also see us going increasingly hard and even if it's as recently as just this last week, when you've seen about the new uniforms we're rolling out. We're looking at every aspect of the employment proposition here, because we do see it getting tighter. And we just believe the more attractive we can make ourselves, that put us in a better chance of being a winner in this marketplace.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: All right, we're near the top of the hour. So with that, I will turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing remarks.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks very much, Mike. And hopefully, we got across we believe today we're fit for purpose and that we're building a better McDonald's. The Velocity Growth Plan is guiding our focus and execution on the opportunities that will improve the experience of our customers. I am fully confident in our ability to harness our unmatched competitive advantages to satisfy customers, drive profitable growth and deliver value to our shareholders. So with that said, thanks to all of you for dialing in and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-30 18:27:25", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Fourth Quarter 2018 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Mike. We're pleased with our strong performance in 2018. Global comparable sales increased 4.5% for the year reflecting our broad-based momentum across the McDonald's System. This is a year when we brought our customers greater convenience, choice and value as we continued aggressively transforming our business. Customers rewarded us with more visits again last year, resulting in back-to-back years of global guest count growth for the first time since 2012. This achievement is even more notable at a time when it's all meeting our traffic growth has been muted. Most of our top markets excelled in 2018 and outperformed our competitors. The U.K. for example, now has 51 consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth and it continue to gain share in a shrinking market. Canada grew comparable sales and guest counts for the quarter and the year, extending its 10-year round of success. With 19 consecutive quarters in comparable sales growth, Australia continued their momentum with offerings such as the successful all-day favorites and the benefit of rising delivery sales. Germany is outperforming competitors as customers enjoy modernized restaurants and the benefits of one of the most effective digital engagement programs in the McDonald's System. The market now has seven consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth and posted its best annual comparable sales growth percentage in 25 years. Italy continues to be one of our best-performing markets. The foundation of that success starts with a great leadership team executing a solid growth plan. The market's also seeing positive results from investing in Experience of the Future and maximizing the business impact of other Velocity Growth Plan initiatives such as digital and delivery. McDonald's Italy had a strong 2017 and followed that with an even better year in 2018. In the U.S., we're in the middle of the ambitious program the market has ever undertaken. The U.S. is executing a significant number of initiatives at the same time. Still in 2018, we grew sales while continuing to invest billions of dollars in our restaurants, making foundational changes in our business and staying focused on our customers. While we have much ahead of us, we made significant progress with a lot of hard work in 2018. The U.S. is a much more nimble organization today than it was in the start of 2018. We reduced the number of co-ops from nearly 200 to fewer than 60 and half the number of field offices. The market trend down the number of most famous as it works with from dozens to fewer than 10. The most significant change in the market resulted in giving our customers better tasting food, greater convenience and a better overall experience. One example in the U.S. is last year's national launch of cooked right when you order fresh beef quarter-pound burgers, getting customers hotter and juicier burgers like [indiscernible]. In 2018, the U.S. converted about 4,500 restaurants to Experience of the Future. That meant we reopened more than 10 new restaurants everyday throughout the year, introducing local communities across the country to a dramatically different McDonald's. This is an aggressive pace with an ambitious agenda at a time when the U.S. market is experiencing intense competitive pressures. Chris Kempczinski and the U.S. leadership team remain engaged in collaborative and constructive dialogue with franchisees. At the end of 2018, they met face to face with franchisees in all 10 field offices across the country. They discussed key challenges facing the business, including the effort required to execute the plan at the current pace and the optimum balance between local and national decision-making. Once we made some tactical and timely adjustments to our plan, collectively we remain committed to the growth strategy. It gives McDonald's the best opportunity to win in what is becoming an increasingly competitive market share fight. I also meet regularly with franchisees throughout the U.S. and earlier this month, I had the chance to visit with several of them in Louisiana and Georgia. I heard first-hand how much they appreciate the flexibility and our continued willingness to work with them in carrying out the plan. This is the right strategy for our business and we're committed to driving shared success. Using our modernized restaurants is easy to see how the [indiscernible] refreshed decor and overall hospitality make a difference for our customers. We established a solid foundation in the U.S. last year that will serve us well in 2019. Now Kevin will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Steve. With a relentless focus on our growth strategy, we continued our strong sales momentum across most of our top markets with global comp sales up 4.4% for the quarter. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of global comp sales increases with each segment once again contributing to the growth. We also grew global guest counts for the quarter. Our top line performance and broad-based strength is a significant achievement given the muted Informal Eating Out environment in most of our major markets as Steve mentioned earlier. Looking across the segment, the international lead markets continue to outperform the competition with comp sales up 5.2% for the quarter, led by the U.K., Germany and Australia. For the full year, every market in the ILM segment delivered both sales and guest account growth, something these markets haven't achieved since 2011. High growth segment comp sales were up 4.8% for the quarter with Italy, the Netherlands and Poland delivering double-digit comp sales growth and positive comps across most of the segment. In the foundational markets, comp sales were up 7.1% with Japan once again leading the segment and positive comps across all geographic regions. Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were up 2.3% for the quarter while comp guest counts remain negative. In 2018, the QSR environment in the U.S. proved challenging with aggressive promotional activity throughout the industry. Despite this, we achieved a positive comp sales GAAP of 100 basis points for the full year versus our QSR sandwich competitors. In the fourth quarter, U.S. sales continue to benefit from healthy average check increases from favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. Value and DL offerings like the four for $6 classic meal deal, limited time offers like the glazed tenders and triple breakfast stack sandwiches and our fresh beef quarter pound burgers all contributed to a higher average check. As I discussed on last quarter's earnings call, construction downtime and slower sales recovery related to the aggressive pace of modernization in the U.S. was a headwind in 2018. We've implemented processes to shorten project downtime and accelerate recovery to minimize the impact to the business as we continue our EOTF deployment. Turning to bottom line results. Earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, an 18% increase in constant currencies after excluding current year impairment charges and tax reform related items in both the current and prior year. In addition to strong comp sales performance, EPS benefited from a lower than normal 19% effective tax rate for the quarter while foreign currently translation was an offsetting pressure of $0.05 per share. Franchise margin dollars grew 6% in constant currencies for the quarter, reflecting sales driven performance in conventional refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined by 90 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset primarily by higher depreciation costs related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. Despite cost pressures around the world like rising labor costs, sales growth and refranchising benefits drove a 20 basis point increase in consolidated company-operated margins. 2018 was the first full year we began operating under our streamlined and more heavily franchised business model and the benefits are reflected in our results. Our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In 2018, free cash flow was $4.2 billion, an increase of 14% over 2017. Our full year restaurant margin dollars grew by over $100 million in constant currencies. And excluding current year and prior year special items, our 2018 operating margin was 43%, up over 4 percentage points from the prior year. In the U.S., company-operated margins declined 190 basis points for the quarter. Wage pressures and continued investments in deployment of our key initiatives contributed to both higher labor cost and depreciation expense. Commodity costs were up about 2.5% for both the quarter and full year. Menu price increases were around 2% for the quarter as we look to strategically balance the need to offset cost pressures with our customers' willingness to pay. For the International lead markets, commodity pressures eased for the quarter up 1% while the full year was up 2%. Menu prices increased about 2% year-over-year. G&A for the year was down 2% in constant currencies. I'll put our G&A savings into perspective in a few minutes when I review our outlook for 2019. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: For the two full years into executing the Velocity Growth Plan, our strategy remains focused on [indiscernible] guest count momentum and regaining customer visits. We're visibly demonstrating to our customers how we're becoming a better McDonald's with a robust range of initiatives. With our focus on improving the taste of our delicious food, enhancing convenience, offering compelling value, upholding the trust consumers place in our brands, we are maximizing our opportunity to improve customer perceptions and encourage more visits. We continuously strive to improve the taste of the iconic sandwiches at the core of our menu and introducing items to even to customers. During the quarter, we have many examples in markets of how success and encouraging visits and sales with menu changes. In Germany, customers continue to enjoy iconic favorites on the Taste of McDonald's platform such as the McChicken. Canada extended the successful launch of bagels earlier in the year by introducing All Day Breakfast Bagel Sandwiches with fresh cracked eggs. In Spain, [indiscernible] drives the popular customers seeking a snack and many also enjoyed adding them on to a meal. Last year Canada had a successful promotion introducing bacon on some of our classic sandwiches and this week the U.S. launched a similar campaign to encourage more visits to our restaurants. We were pleased to see the attention generated with yesterday's bacon events and the U.S. is following up by offering Bacon Big Macs and Quarter Pounders as well as cheesy bacon fries. Time and again we see the importance customers place on getting their food hot and fresh with fast, friendly service. Customers notice a difference when we run great restaurants and we continue to focus on improving the operations of our restaurants to provide customers with great all-round experience. I'm encouraged by the greater discipline we're demonstrating in many of our markets as I simplify menus, take other actions that reduce complexity and improve our ability to provide exceptional experiences for our customers. Serving delicious food and offering great service are vital, but not the only requirements for maintaining strong trust to consumers. Public expectations are leading companies like McDonald's have never been higher. In December we announced that we are partnering with suppliers and beef producers to reduce the overall use of antibiotics in our beef supply chains. This is the latest in a series of announcements throughout 2018 but we detailed both targets by using our scale for good and addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges. In committing our resources, attention and significant convenient power and influence, we are demonstrating to our customers, employees and other stakeholders that McDonald's is worthy of their trust. 2018 also marked a year of significant progress with each of our Velocity, accelerated delivery, Experience of the Future and digital. We will take action in 2019 to capture additional growth opportunities within the Velocity strategy. Delivery momentum continues and is now available for over 19,000 restaurants, over half of our global system. It took us almost 20 years to grow our annual delivery business in the Middle East and Asia to $1 billion. Over the past two years, delivery has become a $3 billion business for both McDonald's company and franchise restaurants globally. Delivery continues to grow rapidly as we expand through additional restaurants and third-party providers as well as benefiting from strong same-store sales momentum. Many of our major markets such as to the U.S., France and in the U.K. achieved delivery sales growth in the high double-digits in restaurants offering a service for more than 12 months and other markets such as Canada, Italy and Russia grew even more. We\u2019re confident this delivery offers additional growth potential for our business. Even with the momentum we already have established, we know we have an opportunity to let more customers know the McDonald's will bring meals to their homes, offices and college dorm rooms. Driving awareness begins with encouraging more customers to try delivery. We talked before about the high satisfaction among our delivery customers and their willingness to reorder and we continue to see those trends hold steady throughout 2018. We placed a high priority on identifying the winning ideas developed by individual markets and spreading them elsewhere within the McDonald's system. With delivery, U.K. Canada and Australia are leaders within McDonald's and are developing innovative approaches to help restaurants with high order volumes. In Australia, awareness more than doubled through a major campaign of promotional delivery within-restaurant signs, engaging social media outreach, PR activity and advertising. And in its own awareness campaign, Uber Eats in Australia featuring McDonald's demonstrating the strength of our partnership. We also continue to bring learning from China, our most developed delivery market, to help our newer delivery markets, especially related to restaurant operations. As we have said previously, underpinning everything we do with this growth accelerator is our commitment to make delivery easy and convenient for our customers, which will help us maximize the competitive advantage of our business. Now I'll turn to another one of our Velocity accelerators, Experience of the Future. The refreshed decor, new ordering options and an enhanced focus on providing more enjoyable visits to our restaurants, we're introducing a new hospitality experience to McDonald's customers. Our guest experience of years have been the key to a better customer experience, which we've seen drive high customer satisfaction and sales and ultimately, strong business results. With about half of our restaurants around the world converted to EOTF, we have many more customers experience modernized restaurants and enhanced hospitality. We've identified an opportunity to be more consistent in assuring restaurants as proven best practices for engaging with customers in our updated restaurants. We've made significant progress for example in the U.S. in training tens of thousands of additional guest experience leaders to greet our guests with enthusiastic smile, assist the customer with kiosk orders, offering trays of Big Macs and fries to a customer's table. We're encouraged by the impacts on our business as we continue to enhance hospitality and complete more projects. Restaurants that have introduced Experience of the Future elements continue to perform in line with our expectations with higher sales and customer satisfaction. Customer expectations for the way they interact with brands continue to rise. We have made additional progress in 2018 rolling out digital platforms, making the McDonald's experience simpler and more personalized for our customers. In the years ahead, we will continue making strides through digital channels to reward customers with good value and relevant offers as well as incorporating fun experiences they appreciate from our brands. These opportunities are possible because the extensive work we completed in deploying technology throughout the McDonald's system, including self-order kiosks in nearly 17,000 restaurants, digital menu boards in more than 21,000 restaurants and new capabilities from low bottle room pay as available in over 22,000 restaurants. Now Kevin will discuss our outlook for 2019.\nKevin Ozan: Over the last several years, we fundamentally enhanced the strength and stability of our business. In anticipation of being substantially complete with our refranchising efforts, we established long-term average annual financial targets set to begin this year. These targets reflect our confidence in our ability over the long term to increase system wide sales 3% to 5%, maintain our operating margin in the mid-40% range, deliver earnings per share growth in the high single-digits and achieve a return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range. The strength and reliability of our significant and growing cash flow enables us to return about $25 billion to shareholders over the three-year period ending this year, including our 15% dividend increase announced last September. Over the last two years, we returned over $16 billion toward this target through share repurchases and dividends. Looking into 2019, we anticipate some headwinds this year around labor cost, EOTF-related depreciation in the U.S., commodities and foreign currency translation, which will put some pressure on EPS growth this year. Higher depreciation expense in the U.S. will continue to impact both franchise and company operated margins over the next couple of years. Franchise-related depreciation expense will increase by about $100 million year-over-year in 2019 and depreciation on company-owned restaurants will also increase about $15 million, both driven by the accelerated pace of EOTF. We expect commodity increases in the U.S. of 1% to 2% for the year and an increase of about 2% in our key markets outside the U.S. Based on current exchange rates, we also anticipate currency pressures to continue for the first half of this year. At today's rates, we expect currency to negatively impact EPS by $0.08 to $0.10 in the first quarter and $0.13 to $0.15 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year. We continue to exercise strong financial discipline and we expect about a 4% G&A reduction in constant currencies for the year. At current exchange rates, this will result in total G&A of roughly $2.1 billion. Since the beginning of 2015, we will have achieved growth G&A savings of over $600 million. After reinvesting some of this back into areas to drive growth, like technology, we'll be down net of about $500 million from our initial 2015 budget of $2.6 billion. We've mentioned that most of our major refranchising transactions are complete. We will continue to refranchise some restaurants to conventional licensees across markets such as the U.K. and U.S. but to a much lesser extent. As a result, we expect gains on restaurant sales this year to be about $200 million less than 2018. Moving on to capital. We ended 2018 with capital expenditures of $2.7 billion. Although this was slightly higher than initially planned for the year, we completed about 4,500 EOTF projects in the U.S., well exceeding our original plan of 4,000 projects. As we've also noted, inflation in the overall construction industry has also been a pressure on EOTF project costs. We currently expect to spend roughly $2.3 billion of capital in 2019. Nearly $1 billion of that capital will be dedicated to completing approximately 2,000 EOTF projects in the U.S. Our recent adjustments to the U.S. plan now provide in the ability to more evenly balance remaining EOTF projects between 2019 and 2020. While we have provided an option for franchisees to extend the projects beyond 2020 at a reduced partnering level, most franchisees are choosing to complete their projects over the next couple of years. So we expect to be substantially complete with EOTF by the end of 2020. New restaurant development continues to be an important component of our growth equation. We plan to open roughly 1,200 new restaurants this year. We will spend approximately $600 million of our capital to open about 300 restaurants in our wholly-owned markets. Our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining 900 openings, nearly half of which are planned in China. This is a demonstration of how the financial resources and capabilities brought by our expanded network of developmental licensees create opportunities for accelerated expansion. As we enter 2019, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.\nSteve Easterbrook: With our strong performance in 2018, you can see why we're confident in our strategy. We have a lot of growth potential remaining in the core of the Velocity Growth Plan and the accelerators provide a solid foundation driving our business as we begin 2019. We also recognized there are significant challenges as we enter the New Year. Kevin shared several of the financial headwinds to growth that we are and as you've seen consumer uncertainty is growing from France to China to the U.K. and elsewhere across the Globe and as well as the tightening economies and shifting political environments. Still we remain optimistic. The investments we already made in modernizing thousands of our restaurants have placed us in a strong position. This will continue, we will continue to prioritize investments in our restaurants and our business so we can keep advancing as a leading global brand in our dynamic consumer landscape. In the fiber market share, some will succeed and others won't. We intend to keep positioning McDonald's on the winning side. And now I hand it over to Mike, who can lead Q&A.\nA - Mike Cieplak: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: I have a few questions related to your capital spending plans. Based on your '19 guidance, it seems like you're expecting then roughly the same amount in the U.S. business this year versus last year, yet you're expecting to complete roughly half the number of EOTF projects. So I guess the question is, has the EOTF project cost materially increased or there other areas of spending that you're not previously - that you haven't previously considered? And also, how should we think about capital spending plans for the out years in 2020 and 2021 given some of the projects being delayed and considering McDonald's co-investment rate will decline to 40%? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, thanks, Eric. And yes, we're trying to stay warm but it's a little difficult these days. All right, so let me talk about capital both for 2018 and 2019. In 2018, we spent roughly $1.4 billion of our capital on EOTF projects in the U.S. In 2019, that number will be less than $1 billion. So it's going down by, I'll call it roughly $0.5 billion, the amount that we're spending on EOTF in the U.S. The other dynamic that's occurring though is there's a little bit different mix in the types of projects that are occurring in 2019 versus 2018 on a couple of fronts. One is our company-operated restaurants. So we did about 200 company-operated restaurants in 2018, but that was only 4% of the total projects for that year. We'll do a similar number of company-operated projects to finish those off in 2019, so about 200 again, but that will be 10% of the total projects for 2019. So that helps skew to a little bit higher average cost. The other dynamic that's happening is in 2018, as we've talked about, some of the projects are what we call non mods these are the ones that hadn't been modernized and need the full modernization of the restaurant in addition to EOTF elements. Those were about a third of the projects in 2018, while what we call modern or restaurants that have already been modernized were about two-thirds. Those are lower cost than the non-mods obviously. In 2019, that split have roughly half and half. So that also brings up down that average cost from 2018. So our average cost per project is a little bit higher in 2019 than 2018 because of those couple of dynamics. Regarding capital going forward, so we said we expect 2019 to be roughly $2.3 billion. 2020, you should expect to be relatively similar to 2019, maybe a little bit lower. And then beginning in 2021, that number should drop dramatically, probably $0.5 billion or so because as we mentioned, we should be substantially complete with EOTF projects in the U.S. by the end of 2020. So hopefully that gives you some more information related to the capital.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Kevin, two questions, Kevin, you caught up the U.S. comps outpace the benchmark about 100 bps for the year. If my math is right, it sounds like you guys were flat against the benchmark in 4Q. So curious what incrementally changed primarily in the in the year as the value environment was fierce throughout 2018? And I guess specifically, did the 50 bps headwind you saw from remodel construction in the first nine months accelerate in 4Q with a greater than expected number of projects? And then separately, this one is for Kevin or Steve, CapEx - can you talk about how you arrived at the guidance for 2,000 U.S. remodels in '19? Just given the fluid nature of discussions with operators and the topic, is the guidance based on some form of buying commitment or is the guidance based on a best case estimate, if you will?\nKevin Ozan: So let me start and then I'll turn it to Steve to talk about kind of how we're going about process wise in the U.S. Related to the comp GAAP, you're right. It was relatively flat in the fourth quarter to get up to that 100 basis points for the year. I guess I would just say you saw the industry throughout the year certainly was competitive both from a price and value perspective. So I think we're pleased in that environment that we achieved 100 basis points GAAP for the year. But to your point it was relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Regarding the headwind, I'll say that EOTF costs, the fourth quarter was roughly 0.5 point. So that's kind of in line with where we had been in third quarter, roughly 0.5 point for the year, I think we expect as we progress into 2019 that will start dissipating so that by mid-year or so that should turn to be a positive impact. So again, partly because of the lower number of projects in 2019 and partly because of all the projects we did in 2018.\nSteve Easterbrook: The second part of the question, Andrew, are we confident in those numbers? I mean, we have through the course of the 10 field office visits that Chris Kempczinski and the leadership team conducted, clearly we're keen to offer operators the chance to what we've described level load their commitments depending on how many projects they had left and just their own sort of cash flow management obviously. So we were really encouraged and shock but we still believe and know that the majority of those of the operators have come forward and they want to rate either retain the existing schedule or maybe level load across '19 and '20 but really want to take advantage of the partner that we have in place. And I think it reflects the confidence they're beginning to see. I mean, once you start to look at the impact of the EOTF, as you start to look at the ample digital menu board, then you start to introduce delivery alongside the self-order kiosks being half hospitality that combined suite of initiatives really is generating much stronger lift. If you look at the - those are completed, now we've got about 8,000 restaurants complete here in the U.S., we've got fact-based data to share with the operators which I think just continues to build that confidence. So I think the operators appreciated the chance of flexibility but the vast majority will complete within the next two years.\nKevin Ozan: Just one last thing I'd add. Just - our 2,000 estimate right now is based on conversations with the operators. So we did - that could change a little bit as we get down to formally planning the exact timing over the next couple of months. There haven't been signed letters or anything like that yet, but based on the conversations we've had, that's where those numbers are coming from.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: A question and then just a quick follow-up on a comment Steve made in the prepared remarks, I just want to clarify. The question is again on EOTF interested at that most of the franchisees are sticking with the original schedule. But I guess to the extent that for the immediate impact has been somewhat mixed or is less visible to those on the outside. Have you contemplated or had anyone contemplated perhaps not co-investing as heavily and just allowing EOTF to roll out on its own with maybe returning more cash to shareholders? I mean it sounds like it's sort of a done deal at this point. But it\u2019s been asked by sometimes even hard to effectively tack those in ROI given relatively flattish market share and some of that went listing. And then just my question - my clarification was, can you characterize the market share price has increased in the competitive and I was just wondering if that meant you're seeing - what you're seeing in terms of promotional activity [indiscernible] are you seeing any kind of trade up or down?\nKevin Ozan: I'll start with the first part and then I'll let Steve come back and talk about market share stuff. Thanks for the question Sara. You know, related to EOTF and our kind of commitment and investment in that, we've seen it be really successful around the world consistently. It generally increases customer satisfaction, we've certainly seen sales increases around the world and we are seeing that same dynamic in the restaurants in the U.S. that we've converted. So we're committed to investing. We believe that our ability and willingness to invest in our restaurants at a relatively quick pace help some kind of separate us a little bit from others in the industry. And so we believe it's an advantage for us to be able to use our financial strength and be able to invest at the right pace and the right time in the U.S. business. So that's why we're continuing to do that.\nSteve Easterbrook: And Sara, on the market share, I think it's probably both IEO and the sort of the broader Informal Eating Out and then the most specific to us the QSR market share is incredibly muted. I mean if there's any growth at all, it's going to be more likely in the QSR and largely a lot of that is down to new units additions. So I guess what that means is any traffic gain units get will be at the expense of someone else. All those people particularly in eating out a little less often and we can respond to those sorts of trends with home delivery, for example. But frankly, we're not expecting any tailwinds from broader growth in either IEO or QSR. Now, if you want to choose to play in one of those, must about being QSR so I feel good about that. And there's a lot of discussion that we have with our markets. It\u2019s absolute sales growth is always attractive. That top line growth like-for-like sales is clearly always encouraging in a positive trend. But no matter what your markets and conditions are, as long as you're gaining share, you're going to end up in a better competitive position in the long term. So we look at market share very closely and we have a pretty aggressive mindset to it. We don't expect, as I said, just to reiterate, we're not expecting any tailwinds, so our share gains will be someone else's pain.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Just looking ahead to 2019 and looking back to 2018. Traffic obviously slowed down last year particularly earlier in the year. When you look at the foundations you've created and the important changes that you're making heading into this year what are the most important ones when it comes to accelerating traffic in the U.S. in particular? And then with regard to the delivery business I would imagine you'll start in-app ordering at some point and with some advertising support behind that. Is the consumer data available only for in-app orders and not through orders through Uber Eats?\nKevin Ozan: Let me take both of those. So I think the market where we really want to drive traffic momentum which will help the overall global figure is clearly the U.S. So I think we have a pretty clear perspective on where the - happening and we just need to get a greater focus on addressing those. So to be very specific we continue to look traffic at a greater level than we want at breakfast. We're doing well with average check growth but we really want the customer comes back and more often. So there are a number of initiatives that we are going to be deploying some of these real nuts and bolts stuff just looking at our staffing levels across those key - day mass. Clearly menu innovations always play a part. We believe the shift back into local breakfast value from a national value on the Breakfast Day part will help us fight against the local competition I guess the local consumer taste better. We believe we are on still - McCafe and the McCafe brand both through coffee and premium coffee. And also we do believe that more personalized digital engagement can also help drive our breakfast business but that's through having customers enjoy the experience and convenience of order and pay and also more personalized and tailored offers in the app. So that's just an example of the focus we have on breakfast particularly across the U.S. and that was hearing when I was in the field offices down in Louisiana and Georgia earlier in the year. Also we're continuing to fine-tune the value in deal promotions. I mean you're familiar with the four for $6. We have two for $5. And of course the $1 $2 $3 menus as entry-level platform in that deal combinations. We're going to continue working on product availability or product offers within those combinations and they can get more competitive as we view that up. Then finally, the one which again I'm excited about and its nuts and bolts McDonald's restaurant operations type discussion is a renewed focus on the drive-thru operation and then just making sure that we really submitted the model that we're seeing. So I think there's a number of areas where we believe the guest count traffic are growing and some - all of that is within our control. So that feels good. With regard to the in-app, now we can get several consumer data by third-party operators. But clearly integrating into our app will give us a fuller data set. So we can clearly data privacy is foremost in our mind. So we always respect that. But we are getting some useful information now but we're more optimistic as we get in there probably in the third quarter of this year integrated more into our app and actually then secure all that information that data set on customers and be more useful to them.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse: In some of the markets that have had Experience of the Future longer in the U.S. Are there any metrics you can share specifically TF usage? And then are you seeing any signs of greater app adoption or app usage in those areas when you sort of have the kiosks for customers into that digital ecosystem?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. So our most advanced advantage probably for example that really started adopting self-order kiosks earlier than anyone else and let me have some fast follower being Australia, Canada Italy, Netherlands for example. What we're intending to see is significant year-on-year usage percentages but in store customers. So I guess what I'm trying to say greater percentage of customers that go into our restaurants are using the kiosk and they get more confident with it, they get more familiar with it. They enjoy just the time they're able to spend on it and ultimately going in groups and then group order for example. So we are seeing some restaurants with as high as 80%, 90% of in-store guests using the kiosks. And particularly now as we had the enhanced hospitality with that they can just order pay on credit go straight to their table and we'll bring the order out. So it really has transformed the experience. So we're actually seeing not just our own data we're seeing customer satisfaction measure dramatically increase. So we're using these learnings to actually help markets that's still in the process of rolling our EOTF for the U.S. and so some other emerging markets because the data is powerful the data is proving on the business case and that's why we're going to continue supporting it as we go.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Two questions, one just on the U.S. franchise system, seems like they're getting increased visibility with the formation of their kind of women association and I guess we're seeing more reports talking about some frustration with things like delivery and investment the EOTF which you guys have talked about in the past. And I guess as all QSR peer seemingly having a - always have a small portion of franchisees out of this quarter. So I'm just wondering Steve maybe whether your concern that this concerns at McDonald's are more on escalating kiosks like it damage the system or maybe you can tell us what you think the biggest concerns on push-backs are. And my follow-up is just for Kevin. I just want to clarify what you said about 2019 EPS. I know you said it will be pressured but I wasn't sure whether that was benchmark and against where consensus is or versus your high single-digit kind of long-term outlook or how we should think about the reference to it being pressured. Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes I'll take the first one and around the U.S. - our owner-operator sentiments and our commitment to this bigger bolder vision plan. So again let's just keep in context just quite how ambitious the plan that the operators and our leadership team build together and that was always going to be hard work. In 2018 it was a year of hard work. It was a year when we as a company and the owner/operators individually become to write more significant checks as they were committing to the plan. So the dialogue always going to happen. The dialogue always does. Sometimes it's in a low level sometimes it just bubbles up a little. I think the good news is we're talking and our teams and the Owner/Operator leadership are talking with one another to see how we can help maintain the confidence in the plan - maintain the commitment to the plan if there's any adjustments or amendments that we need that we can make those as we roll. So I wouldn\u2019t life be great if everyone was happy of course I am fundamentally concerned and it will derail from the shared ambition we have no I\u2019m not at all. And I think just the fact that the dialogue continues means that we\u2019re going to get to a good place and one where we\u2019ll turn out of work feeling excited about the opportunity that we\u2019re facing because more time we can be consumer facing and getting in our restaurants and activate in the plan - because of customer experience and the business results. Again I could hear that first hand from my market as it's this year but in the pattern erosion across Atlantis so the door is always open on that.\nKevin Ozan: And then Jeff regarding where I mentioned there will be some pressure on EPS growth this year. I'm not comparing versus consensus I\u2019m just talking about our internal targets. As I mentioned here just on one time things like games we will be ratcheting down between 2018 and 2019. So that impacts that EPS growth rate until one-time of a change if you will but we've always known we\u2019ve always talked about our refranchising starting to roll off related to depreciation that I mentioned is obviously pressure on margins if you will in 2019 related depreciation. Now that won't impact cash flow or anything like that but it\u2019s obviously has an impact on just bigger EPS growth rate so that\u2019s all I was just trying to say.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Two as well please one Steve you mentioned consumer confidence and other sort of cautionary notes about 2019 was that directed at maybe the year has been little softer after softer start than you thought or is that just sort of standard there's always things in the world to worry about. And then specifically on EOTF I suspect slowing the pace of the conversions probably help sales in 2019 maybe you can comment if there is a change or less burden on sales relative to that. And you also mentioned that your level loading I think at the end of 2019 it will be 10,000 converted in the U.S. and so there is another 4000 to go is that 2000 and then the rest just don't have to get done or how do you think about level loading if you got more to do still then to balance of 2000.\nSteve Easterbrook: I think Kevin will take the second one. Now I was not looking to signal any short-term as of in those comments. I was just thought it was responsible just acknowledge as you enter 2019 as you look around just a global macro picture it just appears a little less certain entering the last couple of years. I mean evidence with all of us anyway I thought it was worthy of note but no I don\u2019t want that to be read into any form of indication of how the year started. And then regarding two things one kind of the ETOF impact as you call it yes, by doing a little less projects in 2019 it actually will be a benefit more of a benefit to sale then if we had done 4000 projects in 2019. So that\u2019s when I mentioned where the ETOF impact if you look at all the pieces should start off turning positive by midyear versus the direct that has been really all of this year. Regarding the number of restaurants or accounts if you will of the EOTF projects, right now through 2018 we\u2019re little over 7500 restaurants complete if you will. If you then think about roughly 2000 being done in 2019 and roughly 2000 being done in 2020. And then likely another 1000 or so remaining that would happen in 2021 and 2022 that gets us to roughly most of the estate because at the same time there are some that we are either relocating or we have rebuild. And so you get another 1000 or so just of restaurants if they are relocate to rebuild over all of those years that gets you to roughly 13,500 or so of our 14 plus thousand estate that substantially all of them. They'll be a few restaurants that we don't get to won\u2019t be a lift.\nKevin Ozan: I just want to hook, I want to go back to Karen's question regarding the app usage trajectory because I don\u2019t think I address that. I want to finish into the broader perspective because you\u2019re asking around self order kiosks basically but it first. All of our technology initiatives whether it\u2019s the global mobile app will be done from mobile order pay introduction of self order kiosks, the use of outdoor digital menu boards. So as we build the kind of customer relationship management, we\u2019ve now trading this very, very proper ecosystem as we start to connect these technologies together. We'll offer our customer better experience, better value more personalization and we will get to understand our customers and their behaviors so much better. So I wanted to acknowledge your point that as we start to get identified customers - once we start to unlock that as self order kiosks or as they put into a drive through lane been our ability to smooth their experience make it more convenient, recognize them individually and also learn of them is incredibly powerful. So these are a lot of foundation investments we're making to create what I think will be an incredibly powerful ecosystem for one of the better word that some is going to provide a lot of knowledge a lot of data for us and a much better experience for our customers.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nGreg Francfort: I just had one clarification to the earlier CapEx comments and then a question. I think to respond Eric\u2019s question you were referring to 2021 CapEx and the 1.5 billion to 2 billion range but I think previously you\u2019ve said sort of low one to through run rate is 2021 not a long-term number?\nKevin Ozan: So 2019 and 2020 will be roughly the 2.3 billion - I just mentioned we\u2019ll have about a 1000 projects left still for 2021 and 2022. So it won\u2019t get all the way down to the longer term run rate if you will it will be substantially less than 2019 and 2020 but not quite get all the way down to normal ongoing run rates.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: On the U.S. I had a question I think Steve you referenced a couple times sort of operational improvements and be the service and I know I have asked about this many times over the past few years. But just wondering if you could maybe share specific action steps you're taking to improve either service that drive-thru in the U.S. I know you referenced some technology benefits but is there going to be a greater push on add in 2019. And if so how are you going to achieve progress there? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: No, thanks David I mean this is the stuff we kind of really get into. So let me just give you a couple of examples of what we will be doing differently that what we believe will help reduce complexity and as a result improve speed. Introduction of technology we've got some new we just call them zoom boards, but these are little digital screens at the drive through present a window. So as where we toss out the food we can really start to provide real time service times within the restaurant and where the little bottlenecks can be whether it\u2019s a delivering process, the payment or whether we are maybe we don\u2019t have the food ready but have also lot of parking one of the parking base for example. But any formation real time setting others a positive competitive nature up against the local drive through restaurants so maybe all the other driver-throughs within overall greater group for example. We seen this operating really successfully in Canada, operating really successfully in Australia and it just provides the competitive spirit also that kind of bottleneck identification. If you\u2019re running that shift you can see why the payment process, we're not handing the cash as quickly as possibly could do why is the ordering process taking slightly longer at the drive-thru? Maybe it's a training issue. Maybe it's a technology issue. So it just enables those issue identification so much greater that you can address them quicker and keep things moving, so kind of real nuts and bolts stuff we get into but allowing technology to help make our restaurant managers and crews' lives easier. And totally different one is, we've got to build a much more sophisticated tool for assessing menu complexity where we can understand the volume of certain menu items we sell, the difficulty that it is for us to prepare the average normal production time, the type of gross margin contribution. It makes our owner/operators and today it is helping us to better identify where and how we can simplify the menu with the minimum customer systems that have viewers are actually driving customer satisfaction and speed but also protects or enhance gross margins as well. So it's a much more sophisticated tool that we can run live product next dated through and really start to give much more fact-based information to our teams in the field so they can make these decisions with a much higher level of confidence. So that's just a couple of examples. But it's across all 10 field offices all 10 of them are have drive-thru service and with Chris mentioned international team have drive-thru focus in service as a key initiative.\nMike Cieplak: We have time for one more question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Just a few very quick ones and first is actually the follow-up on drive-thru service times. Have you seen those peak? I mean in other words are they continuing to get worse or they're stabilizing? And if they're not stabilizing when might you see those stabilize? That's the first question. And then secondly what is your experience of delivery to the McDonald's stores in the United States had the longest not just as a percentage of sales basis but are they happy with incrementality and sales? Are they happy with profitability? Are there any changes that you could potentially see in that program to extend franchisees profitability of delivery? And then the third question if I can is a technical one. Notes receivable and accounts receivable, how are you kind of been bumping up actually for some time. I think there's around $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. So there anything around EOTF related to that maybe in terms of what you're doing with franchisees and might you expect those accounts to be drawn back down a bit on the source of cash for you in the relatively near-term.\nSteve Easterbrook: So I'll happily take the technical one over the [indiscernible] both too. Drive-thru service times have increased year-on-year for about the last five years. We collectively called that to a halt. So we expect to actually reduce service times across 2019 we're starting immediately the activities in quarter one of this year and actually in restaurants currently. So those are collected result service times have to a paint we will not except them for getting any longer and therefore we are looking to address those. So hopefully that response to that question. On delivery we're seeing just great growth in year-on-year for those that have been offering delivery for more than 12 months. So part of the measurement system we have here is not only just we had new restaurants but only where we want to grow the organic business. If you like - we're now into the lapping like-for-like on delivery, incrementality still remains encouraging in that kind of 70 percentage range, average check still remains around 2 times the normal average in-store. We note in the day part analysis as well that helps support our belief and covers any incrementally because it's peaking at day parts that we will ordinarily be a single sort of business piece. So we believe we're well set up to do more. I think the pieces that we're collectively still trying to back him out is how do we drive the awareness because we know as soon as customers try it, they stick with it and jointly stick with it. So awareness here in the U.S. typically we would want to have a critical mass of our restaurants here 70% plus before we were 17 with national awareness. We're marketing campaign or a broader social media campaign. I will say the local co-ops are getting off for it as of when the critical mass of the restaurants in that total now starts both - as we start to expand with Uber Eats and elsewhere around the world with uBer and on a third-partly operators getting the awareness is one of the key priorities we have. So we feel good about that. And now I will hand over to Kevin on the front end question.\nKevin Ozan: Yes related to accounts receivable, so really most of that - most of the increase certainly is related to U.S. EOTF projects. The way it works is we generally manage those projects and so wealth project manage all of it and we'll collect from the operators. And so you are seeing that those balances are up because they've been focused on getting the projects done. Mechanically we need to go through some closing of job in collecting the money from the operators. It is an uncollectible money, it's a timing issue of when we'll actually just receive the - go through the logistics of closing our projects and collecting the money from the franchisees. So yes it should be - it will be at cash inflow as we continue on. I would expect that receivable number to go down now that there will be some pressure off of the number of projects as you think about 2018 everyone was just driving hard toward getting all the projects done. Now we can get some of the kind of other stuff associated with that done like collecting the money. So that's exactly right.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you Steve and Kevin and thank everyone for joining our call today. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor conference call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-10-23 17:30:53", "content": "Executives: Mike Flores - Investor Relations Officer Steve Easterbrook - President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ozan - Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: David Palmer - RBC Andrew Charles - Cowen Eric Gonzalez - KeyBanc Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Matt DiFrisco - Guggenheim John Ivankoe - JPMorgan David Tarantino - Baird Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Andy Barish - Jefferies\nOperator: Hello and welcome to McDonald's Third Quarter 2018 Investor Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.\nMike Flores: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Mike. Good morning. With another solid performance in the third quarter, we remain confident in our business as we continue to execute an aggressive and holistic growth strategy. We are making substantial progress in modernizing restaurants around the world, enhancing hospitality and innovating the experience for more than 60 million customers we serve every day. As a result, we have achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of global comparable sales growth of our increasing top-line, traffic share and guest counts in most of our top markets. During the third quarter, most of our largest international markets continue to drive momentum in our business. Canada has been on the 10-year run of success. In August, I was in Vancouver to meet with the local leadership team, and we visited the first McDonald's restaurant open in Canada. It was recently modernized and we could see the digital menu boards, the refresh d\u00e9cor, McCafe bakery displays and other improvements making such a noticeable change to McDonald's customers. Like many of our top performing markets Canada is excelling at the fundamentals of running great restaurants. The crew members continue to set some of the highest standards of hospitality in the McDonald's system. Customers' appreciate the commitment, crew members in Canada have to personalize service that makes each visit enjoyable as demonstrated by continued year-over-year increases in customer satisfaction scores. Earlier this month, I was in China, we marked a full year since the successful transaction that created the largest McDonald's developmental licensee. The partnership operating at managing McDonald's businesses in Mainland China and Hong Kong offers exceptional business expertise and deep understanding of the local market. They are moving rapidly with ambitious expansion program of at least 2000 new restaurants over five years. They have opened about 375 new restaurants in 2018 over 400 in 2019 and we expect to make a ramp up the phase even more aggressively over the next few years. I was also impressed to see how well the team in China is operating a highly competitive environment. They have made steady gains with our brand image among consumers in China's largest cities as they have modernized nearly 75% of the existing restaurants in the market. China also is a leader in McDonald's system with two of our top growth initiatives, digital and delivery. The market has driven exceptional growth for delivery and is gaining strong adoption for its digital platform. Many of our top international markets are well positioned to drive sustained growth for our business. We have exceptional management teams and aligned franchisees working together to execute ambitious integrated plans. We are confident that we will continue to achieve sustained momentum as our restaurants serve delicious food, offer warm hospitality and advanced strategic platforms enabling us to satisfy rising customer expectations. The U.S. continued to move forward with the most significant transformation ever undertaken in the largest market in the McDonald's system. As we have discussed before, the U.S. team and our franchisees are taking on a lot all at once. U.S. is maintaining an aggressive pace of modernizing restaurants, completing another 1000 projects during the quarter. At our current pace by the end of 2019, we expect to complete over 12000 restaurants with our Experience the Future initiative making this the largest construction project in our history. They still have hard work ahead, but we are seeing an encouraging response from customers in restaurants when many of these improvements are already completed. This is in line with our experience in other McDonald's markets such as Canada. The U.K. and Italy that executed the program several years ago that was similar to the one the U.S. is undertaking now. This continues to strengthen our confidence, Chris Kempczinski, our U.S. President, his team and our franchisees are on the right track as we introduce these enhancements to a growing number of restaurants. As we've evolved to more heavily franchised business model we're making sure our operating structure continues to adapt. We have a growing number of developmental licensees. These business partners are intensely focused on growth and innovation and operates in some of our most complex markets. Starting in January, we'll make changes to the operating structure of our business. Joe Erlinger, who now is President of High Growth Markets, will lead our International Operated Markets. Ian Borden, who now leads our Foundational Markets, will be President of International Developmental License Markets. This structure will ensure we provide the right level of support that will contribute to the success of our developmental licensees and other franchisees. It will also continue to enable us to share and scale our best solutions across our international markets. I also want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Goare, President of our International Lead Markets and Chief Restaurant Officer. Last month, we announced his upcoming retirement. Doug has made many valuable contributions to McDonald's over his 40-year career. We've appreciated his leadership and his counsel and thank him for all he's done for our brand and our organization. Now Kevin will discuss some of the financial performance highlights from the quarter.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve. We're pleased with our strong sales performance for the quarter. Global comp sales increased 4.2%, reflecting positive results across all of our business segments. Comp guest counts grew in most of our top international markets, while in the U.S., guest counts declined during the quarter. As Steve mentioned, our top international markets are consistently leading in driving the performance of our system. In addition to Canada's success, here are just a few other highlights from around the world to illustrate this momentum. Australia has delivered 18 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth. France is enjoying eight consecutive quarters of guest count growth. The Netherlands just experienced their 14th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and momentum continues in Japan as they now have 12 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth. Comp sales in the International Lead Markets remained strong, up 5.4% for the quarter. The U.K. delivered their highest monthly sales and guest count volumes in their 44-year history, resulting in 50 quarters of consecutive comp sales growth. In addition, every market within the segment contributed to the growth. As markets across the ILM segment reach critical mass on Experience of the Future, or EOTF, they continue to see higher contributions from multiple platforms, including value, delivery and digital. In addition to Australia's launch of All Day Breakfast in 2016, they recently introduced an all-day favorites platform. Customers can now enjoy a limited menu of their favorite burgers, chicken and fries, available any time of day. The sustained positive results of the well-established markets in this segment are a demonstration of the size and scale potential of the McDonald's brand. Turning to the U.S., comp sales increased 2.4% for the quarter. A higher average check drove sales due to favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. The product mix shifts were a result of menu news, including glazed Buttermilk Crispy Tenders, our 100% fresh beef quarter pounders and new choices afforded to customers through our value offerings. Initiatives deployed across the U.S., from delivery to self-order kiosks also contributed to the higher check. The U.S. plan is grounded in the importance of delivering a mix of higher average check and comparable guest count growth. As guest counts remain a challenge, we're focused on increasing customer visits. The environment in the U.S. remains very competitive, especially around value and deal offerings. Considering this, we're pleased with our comp sales gap for the quarter of positive 70 basis points versus our QSR sandwich competitors. On our last earnings call, I talked about the need to further appeal to our deal customer segment. We recently wrapped up a successful 2 for $5 Mix & Match Deal offer, and will soon launch a new classic meal deal option featuring some of our iconic core menu items for our customers looking for a satisfying meal at an affordable price. Breakfast remains an opportunity. And in September, we expanded our $1 $2 $3 menu offerings by introducing $1 any size coffee as well as adopting 2 customer favorite breakfast sandwiches at the $1 price point. Soon, we'll introduce new breakfast menu items inspired by our customers. A combination of national value, a return to local breakfast deals and new food offerings positions us to win back customers at breakfast. In the High Growth segment, comp sales grew 4.6%, with positive results across substantially all markets. Italy, the Netherlands and Poland all delivered double-digit comp sales increases for the quarter. Italy continues to gain sales and guest count momentum across all dayparts, and each of the Velocity Growth Plan accelerators are contributing meaningfully to results. And across the foundational markets, comp sales were up 6%. Each geographic region contributed positively to results with Japan continuing to lead the segment. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Kevin. The key elements of the Velocity Growth Plan are working. We have powerful growth drivers at the heart of our strategy. The taste of our delicious food is a top reason customers choose McDonald's. The iconic sandwiches at the core of our menu continue to have strong appeal and we're always striving to make our food even better. France, for example, where we continue to increase market share, saw success with a 50th anniversary Big Mac campaign. The market also achieved a double-digit increase in premium burger sales from the same quarter a year ago, with a lineup featuring proven successful favorites such as the 280 and the Big Tasty. Many consumers also are more focused on the quality of ingredients in their food. And during the quarter, we announced a significant step forward we've made in the U.S. Our 7 classic burgers in the U.S. now have no artificial preservatives, no added colors from artificial sources and still no artificial flavors. This was in addition to the switch we made earlier this year to 100% fresh beef in our quarter pound burgers cooked right when you order. Previously, we also removed artificial preservatives in our Chicken McNuggets. Now let's turn to our accelerators. Delivery, digital and Experience of the Future are proving to be catalysts for sustained growth. As we continue to maximize the impacts of these accelerators, we are expanding choices, enhancing convenience and elevating the overall experience for McDonald's customers. We continue to move aggressively in developing the delivery opportunity. With over 37,000 restaurants, we have a massive global footprint, which provides a distinct advantage by placing us closer to more customers than any of our competitors. We're focused on expanding coverage, growing demand and innovating to increase efficiency and provide better service to our customers. We now offer delivery from over 15,000 restaurants, representing substantial growth from the end of 2016. With the benefit of our global partnership with Uber Eats, we are continuing this expansion. We expect to reach thousands more of our restaurants by the end of the year, including a total of 9,000 in the U.S. Delivery is becoming an increasingly meaningful contributor to comp sales. In several top markets such as the U.K, Australia and France, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales at restaurants offering delivery. We're working to encourage existing delivery customers to order more regularly as we also strive to raise awareness that McDonald's offers this convenient option. Customer satisfaction with McDelivery remains high. Once they experience the convenience, many of them become our most loyal customers, frequently reordering the delivery. The delivery market is evolving rapidly and we're committed to innovating so we remain competitive. We are seeing improved speed and accuracy after completing an initiative early this year to integrate delivery orders into our point-of-sale systems in many of our restaurants. We are exploring additional innovation opportunities ranging from integrating delivery ordering through our mobile app to new packaging that will protect the quality of our food to new approaches that improve efficiency at our restaurants with the highest delivery volumes. Underpinning everything we do with this growth accelerator is our commitment to make delivery easy and convenient for our customers, which will help us maximize the competitive advantage for our business. We have also introduced new technology to our customers that allows them to engage on their terms. Self-order kiosks, which are already in over 15,000 of our restaurants worldwide, provide customers an opportunity to spend more time browsing the menu and personalizing their orders. Supported by our guest experience leaders and with the option of table service, the popularity and utilization of self-order kiosks continue to grow over time with a higher average ticket. In France, Italy and Spain, well over half of all in-restaurant visits are transacted through the kiosk. We continue to engage customers through our global mobile app. Many of our markets have used special deal offers to drive incremental traffic and encourage increased utilization of the app. During the quarter, the U.S. doubled the pace of downloads and registered users, driving more transactions through the app. As this base of active users grows and the rate of mobile order and pay adoption increases, we are providing our guests greater convenience on their terms while gaining deeper insights on their purchasing behavior. All of this is helping us create a foundational base of information upon which we will build programs to deepen our customer relationships. Through EOTF, we are elevating convenience, hospitality and personalization for McDonald's customers. The improvements include crew members who serve in the front of our restaurants as guest experience leaders, kiosk ordering, table service, digital menu boards and a global mobile app. It's clear that customers notice and appreciate the changes we are making. When all of these elements are in place at a restaurant, we are seeing improvements in sales and guest counts. We've seen steady improvements in overall customer satisfaction and in particular in the U.S. restaurants, which have put in place all of the growth strategy initiatives. These restaurants were achieving significant growth in both new customers and frequency of visits by existing customers. And these customers are giving us much higher satisfaction ratings, especially for those that dine in. We're encouraged by the opportunity for our business as we continue to roll out EOTF to more restaurants around the world, maximize the customer and business impacts and to find ways to further elevate the customer experience in the future. We have made significant progress in deploying EOTF across the McDonald's System over the past year. And by the end of the year, we expect to have converted over 15,000 restaurants across the global system, including half of all restaurants in the U.S.\nKevin Ozan: As Steve mentioned, the U.S. is modernizing at an unprecedented pace, transforming over 3,000 restaurants to-date in 2018 alone and expecting to surpass our original target of about 4,000 projects this year. As we move at a quickened pace, we continue to learn throughout this process and adapt our approach in order to maximize the benefits to the business. Overall, restaurants have experienced a little longer downtime than we expected, so we're focused on limiting that in order to minimize the impact on sales and guest counts. The downtime in our restaurants ranges from partial, for example, when the drive-through remains open, but the lobby is closed for remodel, to full, when a restaurant has a large scope project and the restaurant completely closes for a short period of time. The sales and guest count recovery period after we complete a project has also been a little inconsistent. So we've put processes in place to execute strong grand reopening plans after construction that involve our local communities. Overall, we are seeing the sales lifts we expected, so our efforts are focused on achieving those results as quickly as possible. Our refranchising strategy has been a key part of transforming McDonald's into a more purposeful, stable and efficient organization focused on delivering long-term growth. We're now more than a year out from our significant refranchising efforts, including the China, Hong Kong transaction last year and I'm pleased with our resulting global financial performance. Earnings per share for the quarter was $2.10, a 22% increase in constant currencies after excluding prior year special items. Year-to-date, our operating margin improved to 43%. Nearly 85% of our total restaurant margin dollars for the quarter came from our franchise business and the growth in franchise margin dollars more than offset the decrease in company-owned restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margins for the quarter benefited from refranchising as well as positive comp sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation related to our EOTF partnering contributions in the U.S. Consolidated company operated margins declined 70 basis points to 18.4% for the quarter. ILM company operated margins grew 60 basis points driven by positive comp sales, partially offset by commodities and continuing labor pressures. U.S. company operated margins were challenged due to EOTF, labor costs and commodity pressures. Our company-owned restaurants in the U.S. are modernizing at an accelerated pace. In addition to the anticipated depreciation pressure on margins, our restaurants converting to EOTF are experiencing a temporary decline in labor productivity due to a combination of lower guest counts and continuing to pay crew during construction downtime. We expect this pressure to dissipate in mid-2019. Moving on to menu pricing and commodities. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2% while commodity costs for the quarter increased nearly 3%. We expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat in Q4 and anticipate our U.S. grocery basket will be up about 2% for the full year. For the International Lead Markets, menu prices averaged about 1.5% higher year-over-year. Commodity costs were also up about 1.5% for the quarter and we still expect commodities to be up about 2% for the full year. Continuing on to G&A. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected our G&A for the year to be down about 1% in constant currencies with fluctuations between quarters due to the timing of spending. For the third quarter, in constant currencies, our G&A was down 8%, which resulted in cost being down 3% through the first 9 months of the year. We now expect G&A cost to be down about 1% to 2% for the full year. Our effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, down from 25% to 27%, although we may have additional favorable adjustments in Q4 as we finalize the amounts recorded at the end of last year related to U.S. tax reform. Turning to foreign currencies. For the quarter, foreign currency translation hurt our results by $0.05 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect the impact of foreign currency to be a similar headwind in the fourth quarter, which would result in a full year benefit of $0.03 to $0.05. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year. Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to touch on our capital allocation. Our first priority remains investing in the business to drive future growth through initiatives such as EOTF. Our current expectation is that we'll spend about $2.5 billion in capital this year. As we communicated last month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.16 per share, the equivalent of $4.64 annually. The dividend meaningfully contributes to our cash return target, which we increased to about $25 billion for the 3-year period ending 2019 and reinforces our confidence in our long-term strategy.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Kevin. We provided an overview of the progress we are making and perspectives about why we remain so encouraged by velocity strategy and the future of our business. Most of our largest international markets continue to drive momentum. U.S. is growing sales as it makes investments that will enhance the experience of customers we serve. We're encouraged by the success of restaurants that have already put the growth initiatives in place. We will continue to fine-tune our tactics, but we are confident that our strategy is clearly guiding our business in the right direction. The McDonald's System is focused on execution and committed to unlocking even greater potential.\nA - Mike Flores: Thanks Steve. We are now going to open the call for analysts and investor questions. Please press start one, if you have a question and pound one to remove yourself from the queue. And to give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions please limit yourself to one question and we will come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. Now, our first is from David Palmer with RBC. David?\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Question, I think, for Steve on the U.S. There's been a lot of change obviously in 2018. And I think people are trying to figure out which parts of this are temporary friction that you'll evolve out of into 2019 and beyond? And then, maybe where you have learned something and you're going to make adjustments. Just, I guess, to summarize, you've had that shift in marketing dollars out of regional to national value. You have the Experience of the Future. And then, of course, people are hearing about these headlines about franchisees that are adjusting to a new structure of communication and decision-making and I think people want to understand what adjustments you might have to make for that, too. Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: Hi, David, thanks. As we've said all along, really, throughout this year and it will continue through '19. We're taking on a really ambitious plan in the U.S. And we're at that kind of -- the grind out stage at the moment where we're putting significant investments into the restaurant and adapting to changes in that. And it's -- naturally, that's just how it works. So the good news is that we've always had a very proactive, positive relationship with our owner-operators as much as we have with our suppliers. We call it the 3-legged stool. So any conversations which are constructive and helpful into how we can better execute our plan, we're totally open to. So Kevin referred to 1 or 2 things we're looking at with regards to EOTF, for example, on how do we minimize the impact of the downtime so we can come out stronger. So whether it's the initiatives -- and we're learning as we go along with regards to the most effective way of investing the national marketing spend versus the local, for the co-ops. And we continue to learn as we go along there. And breakfast is a good example where we feel there's more regionalization to breakfast, and therefore, we're going to swing a little bit more of our emphasis on the marketing side to the local co-ops to take ownership of that. And then, we can invest in more national platforms in the center. So I think this is evolving. What is really encouraging for us and just keep reminding ourselves why we're doing what we're doing, is not only does the international business provide a helpful kind of signpost to what the opportunities are. But actually even here in the U.S. now, if we look at the analysis between the performance of restaurants which haven't yet adopted any of the EOTF and the major initiatives all the way to those restaurants that have adopted multiple of the initiatives within their bigger, bolder vision plan, there is actually an absolute crystal clear correlation at both sales and guest count level and customer satisfaction level that, literally, as you step up the initiatives -- whether it's going to be EOTF, whether it's table service, whether it's delivery, whether it's outdoor menu boards, for example. As you step up the number of initiatives the restaurants adopt, sales step up nicely with it as do guest counts and customer satisfaction. So you can expect us clearly, as we always do, to work with the operators. And any constructive ideas we're absolutely wide open to. We're just -- our success is inextricably linked. And we actually see our franchisee relationships as being something which is something of a competitive advantage for us. It has been over time and we see it continuing that way. So I think, fundamentally, the key elements that we have built into the bigger, bolder vision plan, which is really pulled together between our own leadership and the operator leadership through the course of 2017, we're still confident in. And as I say, the international business provides a good signpost for that.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great thanks. I wanted to dig into the gap to domestic quick service peers that narrowed in 3Q. You guys are obviously introducing impactful initiatives to grow mix through fresh beef, then the new chicken tenders flavors while remaining competitive on value, through enhancements to the $1, $2, $3 menu as well as the new 2 for $5 promotion. Has the offset to your efforts been a more broad slowdown in service times across U.S. system? Or is this being confined to the disruption of traffic from remodel construction. And if it is the latter, can you help quantify what the impact has been to 3Q comps?\nKevin Ozan: I can start and then Steve can chime in. Let me talk briefly about the comp gap that you started talking about, the 70 basis points for this quarter. I guess, we certainly look at, I'll say, all of the above current year comps, 2- and 3-year stacks, just to look at kind of trends in our business. I think we feel pretty good about the fact that we've had 7 consecutive quarters, 11 out of the last 12 of positive comp sales gap versus those QSR sandwich competitors. I would say that service times still are an opportunity. And I guess, I'll let Steve talk a little bit about that. But it is fair to say that service times remain an opportunity. And so that is one of the big opportunities that I think we still have to continue closing or kind of accelerating that gap. EOTF drag, I guess, real quickly, we won't quantify every quarter what the EOTF drag is. But just to give a perspective, roughly, if I look at year-to-date comps in the U.S., roughly it's probably around 0.5 point impact negative certainly on our U.S. comps. And there are several components of that, as you know. One would be the downtime we're experiencing. And so we're focused on reducing that downtime. One would be the recovery time and how long it takes for us to get back to and kind of volumes that we were at, plus the lift that we expect. And then, net of that is obviously the sales lifts we're getting. As time goes on, obviously, our expectation is that the negative drags will start dissipating as we complete projects while we will obviously be left with the sales increases and sales lift. So again, that's what we've seen in our international markets. I'd say it is a little bit longer downtime, a little bit longer recovery period. But we are seeing similar overall trends in the U.S. that we have seen internationally.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just to add to what Kevin was saying there. I mean, interestingly enough for us, as Kevin said, our service times have slowed down. But interestingly, customer satisfaction has improved. So now we don't just want to rely on that. But it's interesting that as we have enhanced the broader experience that we do see customer satisfaction levels improve, but we also know that speed is a fundamental part of our DNA. So when you look back over the last 2 to 3 years with the introduction of initiatives such as All Day Breakfast, which should help drive the top-line, but have added a level of complexity into the restaurants, introduction of fresh beef, which has really enhanced the taste and the quality of the quarter pounder in the signature ranges, but has been an operational challenge to absorb. And even if you look at such initiatives such as GMA offer redemptions and just the speed with which our drive-through teams can redeem offers and still keep the car count moving through. I think we've got ourselves a challenge into 2019 that I know the team are focused on, which is around how do we get back to the concept of net simplification. I mean, we are always going to want to introduce initiatives that are attractive to customers, which are reflecting where customers want us to go and the changing taste, but at the same time, how can we maintain that discipline of making sure we take as much out as we ever put into the restaurants. So I know in particular with the drive-through, that is a focus between our leadership and operator leadership, and a team has been established to make a meaningful headway into that. It's slightly less of an issue for us in-store, obviously, because customers are now self-selecting how they order. Many are choosing to go to the self-order kiosk because they can get longer dwell time there. They don't feel so hurried. If you're slightly more in that kind of grab-and-go mode, let's say, a busy lunchtime, weekday lunchtime, then you go to the front counter as you typically have. So you'll see greater focus on the drive-through and we do have an ambition to bring the service times back down.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Okay. Thanks for the question. Can you comment on the performance of breakfast in the U.S. during the quarter? Are you still losing share in the morning daypart and maybe if the loss accelerate in the quarter? How much was breakfast hurt by the messaging of the advertising shift?\nSteve Easterbrook: Well, as you say, we've made some tweaks through the year actually at breakfast, both in terms of regional spend -- shifting some of that spend to regional. We're still losing a little share. It's very competitive out there at breakfast. We did make some changes in September, such as adding $1 any size coffee, $1 sausage biscuit, $1 sausage muffin. Again, the local co-ops choosing which of those items are best suited for their customer base. So that shift was really largely through September. So it's a little early to tell as to whether that's going to be sufficient. But we're also -- we haven't had much new food news at breakfast for a little while. And you'll see some new food news in the fourth quarter this year, which I know the team are excited about and so am I. So it continues to be a battleground. I mean, just go back to Andrew's previous question and this one, Eric, is the reality is, it's a market share fight on traffic. There's really no tailwinds in traffic. Any expansion or any additions that anyone, from our data, is seeing is really through new units additions. So on a like-for-like basis, whilst we can get sales growing, I don't see many people -- many out there in the sector who are actually growing traffic at all. So you really -- it's a scrap and it's a market share fight and our teams are responding. So we want to do better at breakfast. We've got some initiatives in place, which we're going to see out through the next few months and also some new food news, which we think will reenergize the daypart.\nMike Flores: And our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Question regarding the U.S. and just the store level margins there. Can you tell us what the decline was year-over-year in the margin there, when you strip out the EOTF down time pressures meaning what was just the decline in margin trend from the kind of the real pressures you're seeing. And a follow up on that, how are these margin issues that are you are seeing framing the current conversations that you're having with franchisees related to the overall strategy, whether that be menu strategy or EOTF strategy and what not? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: I will talk about kind of the financial piece of the U.S. market, then I'll let Steve talk about the owner-operators related to that. A couple of things here, I'll say there were a few pressures on margins this quarter. One was, I'll say, overall labor pressures and that has 2 main components to it. One of them is kind of increase in wages and labor costs. And second is productivity, which would be the downtime and lost guest counts related to EOTF. I'd say about roughly half of the labor impact was due to each of those. So roughly half was on productivity, roughly half on wages. The other piece of hitting margins is the depreciation related to our investments. So as you know, we're -- if I think about the company-operated stores, obviously, we're incurring capital to remodel those stores and the depreciation related to that is also hitting margins. This quarter, we also had some commodity pressure, a little bit more than we had the previous 2 quarters and a little bit more than we expect to have next quarter. So the combination of the labor cost, productivity, depreciation and commodities all hit company-operated margins and put pressure on them this quarter. The only thing, I guess, I'd remind everyone of is our McOpCo margin dollars these days represent less than 10% of our total margin dollars in the U.S. because of the refranchising that we've done and the fact that we're now 95% franchised. But obviously, it does impact restaurant-level profitability and certain of those costs certainly have an impact on operators also.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Just to take up the owner-operator sentiment. I mean, clearly, stating the obvious, owner-operators want to grow cash flow and we want owner-operators to grow cash flow. Our plan was built and designed to do exactly that. Clearly, they're seeing many of the same input cost pressures that the company-owned restaurants are. And when you've got your 2 major lines, food and labor both with inflationary increases that puts pressure on the bottom-line. So I mean, really, this comes down to it being a growth story. We're having strong average check growth, as you would have recognized. And partly, that's because of the strategic investments we're making. I mean, we're seeing higher average checks at the self-order kiosk because people dwell for longer. We're seeing clearly a higher average check in our delivery orders. That can be somewhere between 1.5 and 2x a normal average check. And then some of the other menu initiatives, such as the glazed chicken tenders, for example, have helped boost average check. So it's not an average check story. This is about getting the guest count moving. And if we can get both of those alongside each other, that will give us the top line growth that we're looking for. And I think wherein, back in the day, it used to be sort of a 2% to 3% comp would have helped just a flat at a margin percentage level. We need stronger growth than that. So -- and that's the mindset with which we've built our plans. All of our markets in the developed world are facing similar input cost pressures. So -- and that's why the strength of the international growth is so positive because it does translate into cash flow growth as well as top line growth. But that's why we're going to stay not single minded, but certainly focused on getting the guest count momentum back into the U.S. business. If we can maintain -- if we can generate that and maintain the average check growth, then that's going to be a lot more profitable for our owner-operators, which is what we're keen to see.\nMike Flores: And our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. My question is with respect to the G&A savings and the improved guidance there. How sustainable are those lower rates of savings than what you had originally targeted for?\nKevin Ozan: So, again at the beginning of the year we said that we'd be down -- we expect to be down about 1%, we are now saying 1% to 2%. So in our mind it's not dramatically different this year than what we expected. We will have a little bit more decline next year and certainly we won't have costs related to our operator convention that we have every other year. We don't have costs related to Olympics and then we've taken some actions this year where we will get a full year of savings next year such as the U.S. reorganization. So I think we're well set up to achieve on our G&A savings that we expected next year and this year is coming in a little bit maybe more than we expected or relatively in line. \nMike Flores: And our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. Two, I think basically follow ups. First, it surprised me a little bit that the net EOTF impact in the U.S. was 50 basis points year-to-date '18. So I was hoping you pour some thoughts in terms of what you thought that impact would be as we got into the fourth quarter of '18 and first half of '19 is the first clarification. And then, secondly, half of the U.S. system will be on EOTF by the end of '18. One could interpret that '19 CapEx would be even higher than '18 CapEx or revised '18 CapEx. But I did want to make sure whether that was true or maybe some of the increase that we saw in this '18 CapEx is in fact paying forward for some of the project that you'll be doing in '19 thus allowing your previous CapEx guidance to '19 to remain unchanged?\nKevin Ozan: Thanks John. I'll take both of those. Regarding the net EOTF drag if you will, I said on a year-to-date basis, it's above roughly half a point, it is fair to say that the impact in Q2 and Q3 were more than Q1. So I guess, I'll say it's safe to assume that may have been a little more than 0.5 this quarter, but -- if we want to look at this on a longer term basis because to us there is a long-term initiative for the long-term sustainability of our U.S. business. So I don't want to get into having to talk about a specific impact every quarter which is why we've talked about it on year-to-date. But it is fair to assume that it was a little bit heavier impact on an individual quarter comp sales. Regarding capital, so we said that our capital this year we expect around $2.5 billion. If we look at couple of things I guess to know regarding this year's EOTF projects. One, a little bit heavier skewed to McOpCo, our company-operated stores. So we've completed about 60% of the projects, the company-operated restaurants. So a little bit more skewed to company operated restaurants. The other thing that I would say is, while downtime is a little bit heavier and recovery period is a little bit longer. Construction costs are probably a little bit higher than we originally anticipated to partly because we're going in a -- quicken the pace. And so we're not going to achieve some of the efficiencies that we may have thought that we were going to not dramatically different. So what that means for capital in 2019 is, our CapEx should be relatively similar maybe a little bit higher in 2019 and 2018. We will likely do a relatively similar number of projects potentially a little bit less, but there are some of the higher cost projects. So if you think about what we've got accomplished in 2018, we got a -- we will get more than our 4000 projects done, but some of them are a little bit skewed to the lower costs on easier project to get done. In 2019, it will be some of the higher cost more intense projects if you will. So our overall capital should be relatively similar to the 2.5 again maybe a little bit higher than 2.5 but not substantially higher. And then, again, we have seen some inflation I would say in the construction costs that has impacted some other cost. We do expect this overall impact of EOTF to start looking positive as we progress through 2009, probably in the back half of 2019 is when you should expect to see the net impact EOTF being net positive .\nMike Flores: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning, Steve. I want to come back to your discussion on throughput for the U.S. business. Seems like a big opportunity we've been talking about now for multiple years and I know you've thrown a lot at the system in the past year or so in terms of complexity and new operating approaches. So I'm just wondering, I guess if you can elaborate a little bit more on what you think the opportunity is and what type of -- in terms of drive through speed in terms of time. You think you can shave off of that and what it might mean for the sales going forward? And how quickly you think you can start turning the dial on that whether it's a 2019 or even longer term impact? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Sure, David. I think -- I mean, I think the greatest opportunity we have as we look all around the world and the U.S. is no different, is continuing to maintain our kind of system standards of day-to-day operations. You'll hear me talk a lot about running better restaurants and that's not loose rhetoric. That's an underlying principle by which we're all embracing and at the same time, consumers get increasingly demanding. And therefore, they expect different forms of service. They expect greater interaction with technology. They expect more menu innovation, et cetera, et cetera. So it's always a delicate balance to get the operational foundation right whilst also creating enough energy and attraction in our business to win customers more often in a flat market, frankly. So don't want to put a quantification on the improvement of drive-through. But what we can do and we have done, and you may even remember it from when we actually launched the velocity plan back in March of last year. We're able to model really what we believe the car throughput would be as you can positively impact service times. So whether it's from a car that may be turning away as they enter the lot because they could see the line and that will just turn them off and they'll carry on going, all the way through to just literally throughput through -- in particularly in the peak hours, obviously, the lunchtime hours and the early evening hours. But it's a fundamental truth that the quicker we're able to get service, the more cars we can serve and -- because we are beginning to create the demand. We just need to just be able to meet that now as well. So we'll have more to say around it. But there are probably seven or eight sub-teams within the U.S. working at a number of different areas around complexity. Menu is one of them. Getting reliable technology, working on a more consistent basis would be another on how we can ease the merchandising. We clearly have a broad menu, but how much of that do you merchandise? Do you tend to focus more on your highest-selling items, for example. How we can also improve the training and reduce -- and improve retention of our crew in the restaurants would be another one. What other elements of the building and equipment could we continue to invest in, which would actually make it just easier for our managing crew to run great restaurants. So -- and then just getting back into the disciplines of day-to-day operations, making sure that as we release new initiatives to the restaurant, we provide fantastic training materials for our teams and make sure we don't overload them. So it's kind of a multi-pronged approach. We will continue to be introducing things to our restaurants because that's what our customers expect. But I do think we need to do -- collectively, we need to do a better job and I need to do a better job at ensuring that there's a corresponding reduction in just the workflow for our managing crews. They're working hard out there, and it's not easy. And we're committed to making a difference.\nMike Flores: Next up is Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Perhaps looking outside the U.S. for a moment, Steve you mentioned China and what sounded like encouraging commentary all around in terms of new leaders and their initiatives and how they're pretty keen to accelerate unit growth and what will be your largest market outside of the U.S.? I'm just wondering if you can provide any more color around that in terms of performance maybe the comps this quarter or just broader sentiment because whether it's in comps or consumer behavior or all the headlines we hear about is this caution. And I would have thought we might have heard more of a tempering tale around the China growth story. So maybe you can provide any insight into anything you're hearing whether the qualitative or quantitative that might indicate that?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. Absolutely, it was -- as I mentioned in my comments, I was out there earlier this month actually, I managed to spend two or three days in Beijing with our partners, with our management teams out there and obviously getting into a restaurant. So to give you a sense on the quarter, sales were marginally up in China for quarter three, guest counts were up stronger than that. So they -- the number of initiatives to drive customers into restaurants and that just gives us a marginal positive sales comp. I felt really good about the fundamentals of the market. I mean the 3000-ish restaurants now, 75% of those have being remodeled to the full EOTF standards. They are system leading for us in terms of delivery, both the combination of the McDonald's delivery service, MDS as we call it, which was the original system we adopted there. And then, the use of number of third party operators. Now, it is a dramatic to experience. And I was in one restaurant in Beijing where they created a -- more dedicated delivery area in the front of the restaurant where they were able to just take the riders, and the drivers would come in and we could just service them independently, so it didn't distract from in-store dining experience for our customers. I mean they continue the remarkable journey on the digital platform for example. So we've seen -- got about 60 million app downloads for example, therefore building this rich database of customer behaviors and understanding on the same purchase patents. But also encouraging, just the interaction with our partners, they've got a good long-term perspective. They have already previously announced the ramp up in new restaurant openings from 375 this year, reached, it will be just over 400 in '19. And it won't surprise me to see that kind of rate of acceleration will continue as you look into the out years. Under the new ownership and our management team have settled into a good constructive working relationship. And so I think overall we feel really strong. We were in a very strong position in Tier 1 cities in the most developed cities, it's a bit tougher in the lower tier cities. And again, we are going to keep working on the best positioning for us, the investment levels in the restaurant, menu prices and restaurant sales expectations as we opened more restaurants in those lower tier cities, so we still have a lot more to learn there. But, we have got the right partners in place, you got a deep understanding of the Chinese consumer and Chinese marketplace. So overall, I left China feeling really encouraged that a year 15 months into the new ownership structure that we've made a great decision. And also I'm going to say the -- what was also encouraging is that we're not really seeing any meaningful anti-American sentiment given some of the geopolitical issues that clearly exist between the countries. So I think increasingly, we're being seen to be a local business -- a locally owned business of a global brand and that's also encouraging as well.\nMike Flores: So we have time for one final question. And that would be Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAndy Barish: Yes. I was just wondering as you go through your kind of operating plan and look out towards '19, your competence in reaching kind of your normalized target that you've outlined before any puts and takes that we should be aware of it at this stage after what was termed kind of a choppy 2018?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. I can talk about the financial targets obviously. I think we talked about that we're progressing on operating margins. So I felt very good about our sales target, our operating margins, our ROIIC target and our EPS target as well as achieving our G&A target that we've set. So as I think about all the things that we've set out there going into 2019, I think we feel pretty good about all of those. Obviously, the U.S. continues to be a very competitive market, but as we look overall, I feel really good about all those. And I feel certainly good about achieving our cash return to shareholders target by the end of 2019. So I think we entered 2019 with pretty good confidence in the business knowing that as Steve said we still got a big street fight to continue in the U.S. just for us to continue getting all of our projects done while in the same time trying to achieve comp scale to increase and turn around the outcome growth there.\nSteve Easterbrook: And then, just to add to that, I mean, momentum is a very important psychological helps guide behaviors of our teams. I think as we -- as winning is contagious from market-to-market. I think with our new simplified structure previously, and then, the way we are going to adopt it into the new year. Just the visibility of what working for market-to-market is only getting better and the speed with which we are lifting, localizing and then launching these initiatives has never been greater. We've been through -- clearly we go through our annual planning processes, as we exit or look to exit 2018. I think 16 of our top 18 markets are in positive sales comp territory and some of them are quite -- have incredibly strong sales momentum as well. Certainly as we go through the early look-up plans for next year, I would say our Managing Directors in the markets are confident that momentum continuing. Clearly we are planning to grow in each and every market around the world. So I think the next year -- the next four to six weeks we shape up the detail of the 2019 plans. If there is a mood of optimism amongst the Managing Directors and our field leaders and I share that. But, obviously, none of this is taken for granted. There is not a single market out there, where there is easy growth that just simply is not. Even though what have typically been the hyperinflationary countries where you have a lovely tailwind the likes of a China or Russia historically though. So these are now much more mature markets, much more competitive and we've to sharpen our games in those markets as well. But we are confident in the direction we're heading and excited about what's more to come.\nMike Flores: Thank you, Steve and Kevin, and thank you, everyone for participating. That will end our call.\nOperator: This concludes the McDonald's Corporation Investor Call.

And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter of results as we continue to execute our Velocity Growth Plan. Our customers tell us they value and appreciate the moves we're making to elevate the McDonald's experience. As we discussed a quarter ago, we're confident in our strategy as we continue the day-to-day work of running great restaurants and as we put in place of the most promising platforms for long-term sustained growth. Our International Lead markets offer an important illustration of the successful approach which reinforces the belief in our plan. Markets such as UK, Canada and France continue to perform well with strong sales and guest count growth. These markets began establishing the foundation for today's success several years ago. They developed realistic plans guided by rich local insights about our customers and initiated programs to offer delicious food, compelling value and great running modernized restaurants. They also gained alignment with franchisees and enhanced engagement with restaurant employees, vital steps toward integrated and effective execution. The result is that our customers visiting these restaurants today can easily see our commitment to providing them with a great experience. With a solid platform in place, these markets also have been more effective in activating additional initiatives for growth, such as digital and delivery. We've demonstrated our ability to transfer winning ideas across our markets and that's another reason for the continued confidence in our business. As I mentioned last quarter, the U.S. is in the first year of executing an ambitious and holistic three year plan aligned with the Velocity strategy. Many of the initiatives in the U.S. have been key drivers of the success in our international markets. The U.S. business completed over 1,300 more Experience of the Future, or as we call it, EOTF, restaurant conversions in quarter two. While this aggressive pace comes with some limited downtime, it essentially means we're providing customers with an improved and modernized experience in roughly 10 additional restaurants every day. To-date, we have a total of over 5,000 EOTF restaurants, which is more than one-third of the U.S. estate, offering elevated hospitality and convenience to our customers. While EOTF brings dramatic improvements to our restaurants, it is not the only major initiative the U.S. business executed during the quarter. We also successfully completed the rollout of cooked right when ordered quarter pound burgers using fresh beef, continued to redefine convenience with delivery and refined our value offering, including our $1 $2 $3 national value platform. We know the combination of key initiatives to improve the experience for our customers makes a difference. Restaurant success saw in executing multiple elements of the U.S. plan are achieving high sales, guest counts and cash flow. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to join our U.S. President, Chris Kempczinski, and several hundred of our U.S. Owner/Operators, who are meeting here in Chicago. We're not yet where we need to be with regaining more customer visits, and the front and center focus of the discussion was growing guest counts in our largest business segments. Together, we're taking on a lot, and own Owner/Operators are working with our U.S. leadership team on the greatest opportunities to strengthen and grow our business. The U.S. business recently made changes to its organizational structure to better support the way we work with Owner/Operators to run great restaurants. We've removed layers from the field organization whilst increasing resources in key areas, such as technology and field consulting. A key element of the restructuring includes providing more consulting and better support for Owner/Operators we execute together on the many initiatives of our bigger, bolder Vision 2020 U.S. plan. We expect to see improved speed to market and decision-making as the U.S. becomes fit for purpose. And that better alignment enables us to provide a great experience for our customers and unlock the full potential of the plan. This gives a high level of view what's driving our business. And now, we'll share details of our results for the quarter. Globally, comparable sales increased by 4%, during the quarter, marking our 12th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. Global comparable guest counts declined slightly during the second quarter, dropping by 0.3%. Guest counts grew in all of our international operating segments, but in the U.S., quarterly guest counts decreased from a year ago. And now, Kevin will walk you through more details about our sales and guest count performance during the quarter.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Our strong global comp sales performance for the quarter reflects positive results in every business segment, led by the International Lead markets in Japan. This quarter also marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive guest count growth in all international segments. Taking a look at the U.S., comp sales increased 2.6% for the quarter, with a positive GAAP of 90 basis points versus QSR sandwich competitors. A higher average check drove sale due to favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. The product mix shifts were a result of several factors, including a trade-up to higher priced items such as our fresh beef quarter pound burgers and $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu add-ons resulting in higher basket size. An important part of our U.S. plan includes delivering a balanced mix of both higher average check and comparable guest count growth. As I just mentioned, we've seen positive benefits in average check. However, we remain intensely focused on increasing customer visits. As we've said in the past, we must be competitive on value. We don't strive to win on value, but we won't lose either. With a sluggish IEO market and the introduction of our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu at the beginning of the year, we've seen our competitors increase their attention on deals. Therefore, we know that we need to be more aggressive to compete effectively. While our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu is driving incremental sales and guest counts with our budget basic value customers, we need to do more to attract other customer groups. In addition to the delicious food that customers can get at a low price every day, we know that certain customers are looking for a great deal in the marketplace. We need to better meet the expectations of these deal customers and give them reasons to visit us more frequently. As I mentioned earlier this year, while we will maintain our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu as our everyday value platform, we'll also pulse in deal offers from time-to-time. For example, in second quarter, we featured the 2 for $4 breakfast sandwiches. And beginning in early August, we'll have a 2 for $5 Mix & Match deal with some of our iconic sandwiches that we know our customers love. Turning to the International Lead segment, comp sales were up 4.9% for the quarter, with all markets posting positive comp sales and guest counts. The UK continues to lead the segment with high single-digit sales increases for the quarter. And continued momentum in France helped them achieve their highest-ever market share. Comp sales for the High Growth markets increased 2.4% for the quarter, driven by both Italy and Poland's double-digit sales increases, partially offset by continuing challenges in South Korea. Our Growth Plan accelerators of digital, delivery and EOTF have been critical contributors to these markets' success. As our Experience of the Future incubator market, Poland is demonstrating what a difference it makes for customers when our restaurants successfully integrate all EOTF elements. And across the Foundational markets, comp sales were up 6.8%. Each geographic business unit within the segment contributed positively to results, with continued strong performance in Japan leading the segment. Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. The philosophy strategy is working because it's grounded in evolving our business on the customers' agenda. McDonald's customers have high expectations that we will offer them great tasting food, value for money and an experience offering enhanced convenience. As we make significant progress in each of these areas, we are continuing to see customer satisfaction scores improve in most of our larger markets. Our UK market, for example, continues to be one of our best performers as the market achieved robust sales again during the quarter. Sales were the second highest on record in May, and April set a best-ever mark for guest counts. Many elements are coming together to drive this performance. In addition to the success of iconic menu items such as the Big Mac, our Signature beef premium sandwiches continue to be popular with our customers in the UK. France also found success with promoting sandwiches from the core of our menu, such as Big Macs, premium sandwiches like Le Big Tasty and the McFirst, a Petits Plaisir, which continue to provide customers delicious food at a compelling price point. And, as I mentioned, the U.S. also made strides in improving the taste of our food. The cooked when ordered Quarter Pounders made with fresh beef are hotter and juicier. We're pleased with the high customer awareness and enthusiastic responses. Sales are up and market share gains indicate that within the large classic burger category, customers are choosing McDonald's more often. Value is essential to what many of our customers expect from McDonald's. Kevin offered details earlier about the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu and how we're optimizing the U.S. value platform. Our markets across the world also have value at the core of their strategies, utilizing extended always-on, compelling everyday value platforms plus rotating deals. We are finding that the McDonald's mobile app is an increasingly effective way of extending appealing deals to our customers. We've talked previously about markets successfully using a digital activation approach that customers appreciate, with daily deals offered over several weeks or a month. Our velocity accelerators are continuing to gain traction and contribute to our business. They represent significant opportunities to enhance the customer experience with greater convenience. Today, I'll offer up an update about the progress we've made with the delivery accelerator, the business impact we're seeing and what we expect in the future. The delivery market continues to grow. With the power of proximity, McDonald's is well positioned to be a leader in delivery. Across the globe, there are more than 1 billion people living less than 10 minutes from a McDonald's. That gives us a significant advantage in quickly bringing delicious food to our customers in their homes, offices and college dorms. We've been moving at a pace that is unprecedented in the McDonald's System. Last July, delivery was available in about 7,800 McDonald's restaurants around the world. We've continued expanding and now delivery is available from more than 13,000 restaurants through 60 markets on 6 continents. Customers are responding. Delivery's becoming a meaningful contributor to our sales. And in several of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. Delivery requires virtually no additional investment and is tremendously effective in bringing profitable and incremental guest count. We're continuing to see delivery orders of about double the size of the standard restaurant average check. Our biggest opportunity remains in driving awareness. When more customers learn they can get their favorite McDonald's food delivered right to their door, we're confident we'll see delivery sales continue to grow. With McDelivery Day earlier this month, we celebrated the success of enhancing convenience to our customers with delivery. During the day, we engaged with customers around the world and saw a surge in delivery activity in the markets participating in the campaign. In the U.S., for example, we had the highest number of delivery transactions ever in a single day. We were also able to leverage our FIFA sponsorship during the World Cup to raise awareness about delivery. A number of our markets, including Portugal and the UK, ran fun and effective promotions that reinforced the convenience of delivery. Our strong relationship with Uber Eats is one of the reasons delivery has been so successful for our business. Over the past year, we've worked effectively with Uber Eats to optimize the delivery process. We've taken steps to protect the quality of the food as it travels from restaurants to our customers and improved operational efficiencies so orders are delivered as quickly as possible. We're continuing to work closely with Uber Eats to elevate the customer experience and introduce marketing promotions that should stimulate even more growth. Delivery, like other elements of velocity plan is contributing to our success now and offers untapped potential for us to capture in the future. We'll look forward to sharing updates as we make additional progress. Now, Kevin will discuss more financial highlights from the quarter.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.90, a 9% increase in constant currencies. These results include $92 million of strategic charges, primarily related to reorganizing our U.S. business unit, which Steve mentioned earlier. Excluding these charges and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share was $1.99, a 12% increase in constant currencies. Business performance from comparable sales growth offset the impact of refranchising, while the quarter also benefited from a lower tax rate. As I talk about our operating performance, I want to remind everyone that our second quarter results are compared against results last year prior to refranchising China and Hong Kong. This was the most significant refranchising transaction in our history, which we completed last July. As I've mentioned in the past, we measure the efficiency of our business by our operating margin and this serves as a comprehensive gauge of our overall performance. We've taken significant steps to capitalize on the strengths of our business model, achieve efficiencies with our G&A and stabilize our P&L, all of which are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin as we continue to progress towards our target of mid-40s. Year-to-date, our operating margin was 42%, up from 37% last year. The largest and most important component of operating income is our franchise margins, as over 80% of our total restaurant margin dollars now come from our franchise business. For the quarter, every segment grew franchise margin dollars, led by the International Lead markets, while global franchise margins totaled nearly $2.3 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies. Refranchising benefited the quarter, along with positive comp sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to our EOTF partnering contributions in the U.S. Consolidated company-operated margins declined 80 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter. That decrease was primarily driven by continued labor and commodity pressures across key markets. Moving on to pricing and commodities, second quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up about 2%, which was below food away from home inflation of 2. 8%. Commodity costs in the U.S. for the quarter were also up around 2% versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase 1% to 2%, as we anticipate commodity cost pressures will lessen in the fourth quarter. For the International Lead markets, commodity costs were also up about 2% for the quarter. And we expect commodities to be up a similar percentage for the full year. ILM menu prices averaged about 2.5% higher year-over-year. Continuing on to G&A, G&A for the second quarter increased 2% in constant currencies as a result of higher restaurant technology spending, along with costs associated with our worldwide convention in April. We continue to expect our full year G&A to decrease about 1% in constant currencies. Our effective tax rate was 26% for the quarter. While we may have additional adjustments this year as the guidance on tax reform continues to evolve, we still expect our full year tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range. Finally, looking at foreign currencies, EPS benefited $0.05 per share for the quarter due to foreign currency translation. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and based on current exchange rates, we now anticipate FX will be a headwind of $0.02 to $0.04 for the third quarter, with a full year FX benefit of about $0.07 to $0.09. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year. Now, I'll turn it back to you, Steve.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: The momentum in our business shows that the Velocity Growth Plan continues to gain traction. We're still in the early stages, and we're confident there is plenty of growth left in this plan. We recognize in the U.S., we're experiencing the challenge of a highly competitive environment while executing an ambitious and complex multiyear plan. We know we have a strong and an agile leadership team and committed Owner/Operators working together and moving quickly to take the right actions for our business. While we focus on business performance, we also continue to take steps that strengthen our brand. During the quarter, we completed the transition of entirely moving our global headquarters from the suburb of Oak Brook to the heart of Chicago. We marked the occasion with a grand opening in early June, when we were able to honor current and former leaders of our company who have done so much to help build the McDonald's brand. This move has continued to energize our teams as they experience a more open collaborative environment in our new headquarters and enjoy the dynamic neighborhoods of such a vibrant city. Also in June, we generated brand excitement with our customers as we moved forward with the first in a series of cross-promotional campaigns in the U.S. with Disney. We featured Happy Meal boxes and toys themed with Disney's summer hit movie Incredibles 2. As you can see, the broad-based success across our business illustrates the strength of our overall approach. We look forward to sharing additional progress in the months ahead. And I will hand it back to Mike and we can take some questions.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Thank you, Steve. We'll now open up the call for analyst and investor questions. Now, the first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to just ask about the emphasis on value. And I guess twofold, one is to the extent that maybe the value platforms that you had the beginning of the year weren't quite as strong as they needed to be, I guess are you confident that you've gotten ahead of that now because presumably there will be competitive response to anything new that you bring out? And the second question related to that is the issue tension with franchisees, because, again, it seems pretty apparent that value was going to be a very competitive space. But your McOpCo margins have come under pressure. So I wasn't sure if maybe that's what has kept you from being more aggressive.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Hi, Sara. I'll take that one. Here's what we did. As you know, at the very start of the year, we launched the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu and that was established as our kind of everyday entry value level. And we always said it was going to take us a quarter or two to fully be able to analyze consumer response to see the dynamics across our business, whether it was from a top-line sales, whether it's from guest count and also the margin implications. We continue to be confident that platform is resilient and is delivering what we expect it to do. However, I would say because we have been aggressive, we have seen more competitive activity in the area of value broadly. We've been able to decompose our trading performance to actually analyze the opportunity we believe we have in the area kind of meal deals. That's where the competition has been particularly strong. So we believe that the $1, $2, $3 entry level, if you've just $1 or $2 in your pocket, it works. If you want to add on to your meal combinations, it works, whereas the meal deal element where we think we need to be more competitive. And both Kevin and I steal from the phrase that Chris Kempczinski uses with the U.S., which is we will remain competitive on value. We're not looking to win on value. We will remain competitive. I can tell you as recently as this week, and having spent a good deal of time with a few hundred of our leadership Owner/Operators, we were able to analyze the detail. We're able to galvanize ourselves together. I'm not going to give a whole heap of detail about it, but you can expect us to be reactive and far more agile in the way that we respond in the marketplace. And the Owner/Operators are absolutely consolidated and behind that decision because they want to grow guest counts because they know that's the ultimate lifeline of our business. So is there work to do? Yes. Are we happy with where we're at right now? No, not entirely. Are we confident that we've got the right plans in place and the support from the entire U.S. Operator system? Entirely. So we're going to keep pushing on and competing hard.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great, thanks. You called out 90 basis points outperformance versus quick service peers versus a roughly, call it, 200 to 400 basis points level you had been running over the last five quarters. And so, you kind of touched on it a little bit with the meal deals, but what do you attribute to a narrowing of outperformance versus quick service peers as Q2 did offer compelling value between $1 $2 $3 and the two for $4 breakfast sandwiches?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I would say we're taking share on a sales point of view, but we're not taking share on the guest count. So I mean, it still comes down to driving the guest count. So yes, we put some activity in the marketplace. What we are looking to do, I mean, there's a number of initiatives that we have agreed upon across our U.S. business. So, for example, when you look at our breakfast performance overall, that's an important part of our overall sales mix, as you know, and it's been a stronghold for us for many, many years. But we've just begun to lose a little bit of share at that daypart, in particular. And, as we've also explained in the past, we have changed our approach to how we market across the U.S. We moved a little bit more out of the local marketing dollars into the national marketing. We believe, for example, that for getting the breakfast share back, that's more of a local market activity. The tastes and wants of consumers around the U.S. are pretty vastly different at that breakfast daypart. Some are: coffee-led markets that are food supported; others, food-led markets that are beverage supported. So we believe putting the power back into the local co-ops is the right way to go. So, yeah, there's multiple facets to it. We have taken share on the sales level for 72 of the last 78 weeks in the U.S. and that's a trend we expect to continue. We want to get the traffic share back as well. So we want to be greedy. We plan to be greedy and win on both sales and guest count and that's where we're galvanizing ourselves around.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next question will be from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. Just touching on the company-operated and, I guess, maybe more importantly, the franchise profitability, I think you said all constituents are behind you in terms of being more nimble. But with the continued pressure on labor and, I guess, to a lesser degree, food costs, it seems like you want to keep pricing below food away from home. But do you think the franchisees are okay with the near-term margin pressure or do you think maybe that this inflationary environment is unusual and, therefore, justifying a further bump in the pricing, whether or not that's on premium or still keeping the value? I'm just trying to gauge the franchisee sensitivity to this aggressive value push and their profitability.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well, Kevin, can certainly follow up. I'll have the first stab at this one. There are multiple dimensions to what grows, obviously, cash flow. And, at the moment, the average check growth is strong. Not a lot of that's coming through pricing. A lot of it's coming through mix. With the increasing take-up of customers take-up self-order kiosks, we get a higher average check there. As we continue to roll out delivery, we get twice the average check there. So I'm not so concerned about the average check increases as long as it's not being too forceful through just price itself, because the consumer is still sensitive out there. People are a little tentative. They're a little cautious and you got to stay in line. We are very transparent with our Owner/Operators. We engage with them day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month. And we share with them exactly what they can expect from food costs and commodity increases, and what we can expect from utility increase, what we can expect from new product margins. I mean, would we all like to grow income? Well, of course. Are they still entirely unified behind the plan we have and believe in its long-term strength? Absolutely, right. And there's nothing we want to do more than grow operator cash flow, because that's such a great motivator for future investment and future confidence. So in the immediate term, they are pragmatic, but we certainly have a desire to be growing, not just our own income and margins, but also their cash flows as well.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next up is Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Just following up on the conversation, you kind of keep saying this thing on value, that you don't want to win on value, you just want to be competitive, but I think, arguably, a large reason why sales trends have been so solid for extended periods is because you've been winning on value. So I guess the main question is, why not have a strategy to continue to win on value? Is it because of the margin structure of value and the headwind it presents for franchisee profits? Or is there some other reason why you don't want to necessarily win on value moving forward?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well, I'd slightly dispute the fact that the sales growth has come from winning on value. I think it's been multidimensional. I think, yeah, we're selling more premium products at the top-end of the menu with the Signature Crafted. When you have a investment in a restaurant, we see the pickup in sales from the EOTF conversions, which are still delivering what we have seen elsewhere in the world. When it's a full modernization EOTF here in the U.S, we're getting mid-single digit sales uplifts. When it's just adding the EOTF elements on modernized restaurant, we're still getting 1% to 2% uplift. So I think there's multiple levers at play that are driving the top line. And the reality is, we are looking to build a moat around the business. And the more we invest in food quality, the more we invest in our employment proposition and enhance services, the better the technology relationships we have with our customers, the more modernized our restaurants become, the harder it will be for people to compete with us. And therefore, we're not intending to lead any race to the bottom here. We just want to be competitive on value. And I retain that and we stand behind that.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next caller is David Tarantino from Baird.\nDavid E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. A couple questions about the U.S. comps, so, first, could you talk about how the launch of fresh beef did relative to your expectations prior to that launch? And then secondly, I was wondering if there were factors outside of this value discussion that might have hurt the comps in Q2. And specifically, lower throughput following the launch of fresh beef, given the operational change there or disruption from the remodeling activity, if you could just comment on those last few factors as well. Thank you.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah. Again, I'll try and address these as best I can, David. So, fresh beef has been a significant operational rollout for us. Let's, first of all, just recognize what we're doing here. Really it is a material change to the operating system on our largest beef patty. And the great news is because the buzz became so strong, the awareness levels at launch were around 80%, which is kind of way on the top end of any sort of promotional or launch activity you can normally expect. Consumer sentiment has been really high. And we believe we're taking share in that sort of bigger burger sort of category. That said, it has been a slight operational complication to us. It's added a few seconds to service time. The teams are on to that. I mean, first of all, there's familiarity in a restaurant, which will help bring that down. But also, we're looking at other things we can do to simplify the operation to help bring our service times down. So I think there's a marginal increase, particularly in the drive-thru. It's less of an issue in store. It's almost mainly through the drive-thru. And our teams are looking to address that. Go on, Kevin.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: I'll take a little discussion on EOTF downtime that you mentioned, David. I guess, just to give a perspective, EOTF downtime, obviously, depends on exactly what we're doing in any particular restaurant. But roughly, a week, five to 10 days or so, would be kind of normal downtime. But you also have to think about there's a little bit of an impact on what I'll call collar days, kind of right before and right after that. So that you actually get a little bit more impact than just the days it's down. Now, that does have an impact on current quarter comp sales, guest counts and margins, because, as you would expect, labor becomes a little bit less efficient when you have a week of downtime. So those stores that go down do have some near-term impacts. I think it may be a little bit more than we even thought, I think as we're getting into some of the projects we want to make sure we're doing all the right things and getting in once and getting it done right. We feel pretty good about when they come out of that downtime, though, when they reopen, what we're seeing is the markets or the restaurants increase sales similar to what we've seen internationally, which is the mid-single digit sales for people who do a full remodel and, obviously, less than that for people who just add the EOTF elements.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Just to add to that as well. I mean, yeah, we're a large business and sometimes our numbers can be in millions and billions. And kind of, we just get used to that. I want to put in context, we converted 1,300 restaurants in 90 days. And that means across that quarter, 14 or 15 communities are waking up every day to a dramatically modernized restaurant and a much better experience. So is there a little drag through this conversion period? Yes, there is but I wouldn't swap it for anything because the upside for the long-term, actually the medium, but also the longer term, is so evident to us, as is evidenced by the performance out of Canada, out of UK, out of France, out of Germany, out of Italy, out of Spain, out of Poland. We know these are sales kickers and sustaining sales growth. So we'll take a little short-term bit of pressure on that, but we're unflinching in our desire to modernize the estate here in the U.S. And I'm proud of the team because 1,300 restaurants in a quarter is quite remarkable.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on U.S. store margins, in prior quarters, you've talked about some pretty explicit almost one-time investments in training and getting the stores ready for a lot of the initiatives that are in the pipeline. Could you give us a little bit of color for what that sort of investment or what that sort of pressure in the quarter could have looked like?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Karen. I think that pressure is dissipating. We now have fresh beef in all of the locations. So certainly, you would have seen for the first half of the year for several months of the year, some training and investment as we were kind of ramping up to get fresh beef in everywhere. I'd say that's starting to dissipate. Now, we will still see it here and there as we do EOTF restaurants, because once a restaurant goes through EOTF, it generally takes a little bit of time to settle back in kind of normal because it is a change for the restaurant also. So we'll see some of that continue as we convert EOTF. But I'd say overall, the overall investment, if you will, is starting to dissipate from where it was at the end of last year, beginning of this year. From an overall margin side, I'd say labor costs continue to be a pressure. Commodities this quarter were still a little bit of a pressure. And that EOTF downtime, as well as depreciation, will be another pressure in the near-term as we go through these EOTF projects.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. You've talked about this gap, right, of either in the U.S., who's done it early, or the international markets that have done Experience of the Future or value delivery, et cetera. And it's at the higher comp than what the U.S. comp is. So how important is the field management streamlining and change and support you can offer the franchisees in closing that gap and capitalizing on these opportunities?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: So that's a great question. I'll take that. I mean, the reality is building a strong aggressive multidimensional plan is one thing. Executing it is everything. So what Chris and the team have done is taken a look at how can we best reallocate our resources to where it's needed most. And we are now in execution mode. And I tried to paint that picture a little bit last quarter and you can expect me to continue paint it probably the next six or seven quarters, in all honestly. We're in execution mode. Now, we will finesse the plan a little bit along the way. We'll be agile. But fundamentally, we know have the right drivers in the right place. And what we want to do is best support the Owner/Operators and help them execute to the highest level. And I typically said I will take an 80% quality plan executed 100% every time over a perfect plan that's executed 80%. Because ultimately, it's the customer experience that really, really matters. So the reorganization and the reallocation of resources to help get stability and consistency into our technology platforms to make it easier to run the restaurants, and also just provide that consulting support. We've got project management offices set up. We've got what we call tiger teams that will go and find the little hotspots anywhere and just help with the execution. Actually, it's the boots on the ground, experienced field consultants who can help support and guide the Owner/Operators through this quite a significant transitional phase that we're going through. That's the whole purpose of it. And I'm confident that it's really going to be well received by the Operators and they're excited to receive more support.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh - Stephens Inc.: Yeah, thank you. I had a question on the International Lead markets and other growth markets as we could maybe translate those to what's happening in the U.S. or what may happen in the U.S. Can you talk about the evolution of average check and guest counts that you've seen over time as you've undergone modernization and various value initiatives in those international markets and now, obviously, we're seeing some benefits of those? How should we translate that success to what we're seeing in the U.S. and maybe what potentially we will see?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well I think it does differ by market because the competitive environment differs by market. But if I was to take a broad swipe at that, I would say historically, what we've tended to see and, again, this is a generalization. With sales growth, typically around half of that over time has come from guest count growth and about half from average check. And the majority of the average check growth has typically come from pricing. What I do tend to see now in the International Lead markets is, yes, there's absolute guest count growth. Actually, the average check growth is a little higher, but not because of pricing. People will price in line with the market, in line with food away from home, in line with the competitive environment. But once you get those platforms in place, you tend to be able to leverage more at the premium end of your menu. As I mentioned before, the more customers that choose to order through the self-order kiosks tend to dwell a little longer and spend a little more because the average check's higher there. And as we roll out initiatives such as delivery, we're getting an average check kicker there as well. So I think what we'll tend to see is we still want that guest count growth. It wouldn't surprise me if the average check growth becomes a little more significant than the guest count growth, but we just absolutely not want to do that through price. It's really through leveraging the investments we've made. And once you get that quality base in place, that gives you a lot of opportunity to get your mix right, your basket size right and customers tend to do a little more and spend a little more.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Alton Stump with Longbow.\nAlton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you and good morning. Back to your comment about the breakfast first half of the year, outside two for $4, both your platforms, $1 $2 $3, of course, fresh beef were certainly an indicator focused on, of course, the lunch and the dinner dayparts, So I think by your comments I understand the fact that a lot of it should be local marketing. But is there an opportunity from a national perspective to put more focus behind your breakfast offerings during the back half of the year?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, I can take that or start that, Alton. We talked about breakfast has been a little bit of an opportunity for us for a little while. I think one of the things that happened was breakfast was really carried locally, primarily last year. And we kind of had an abrupt change at the end of the year where were really moved almost all of it to national. And so I think what we've been spending the last several months is just make sure we have the right balance. You will see there's obviously breakfast products on $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu. As we've talked about, we will likely tweak $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu as we go through the year, so you could see little changes. So there will be a big piece of breakfast that is included in the national platform, the $1 $2 $3. But in addition to that, we need to make sure that we carry some important breakfast messages locally, because there is a difference, certainly maybe even more so in breakfast than other dayparts, places like the South that really like biscuits. It's going to be very different than the Northeast or Northwest. And so, we just need to make sure we've got in the night national value platform related to breakfast as well as the right local messages that can resonate with the individual local customers in each place. The only other thing I'd say is breakfast guest counts remain negative. So we still got an opportunity for that. We did have positive comp sales in breakfast in the second quarter. So we have seen at least a little bit of the trend start improving. We still have a lot more way to go. But we did see breakfast comp sales finally positive in the second quarter.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Well, I think you can also probably at a national level, expect to see us continue to invest and support the McCaf\u00e9 brand more broadly. I think that has national \u2013 a universally supported nationally across the U.S. with our stripped coffee or the more premium coffees now with the investments we've made in quality equipment. So, I think that one lends itself to national, but certainly food-led breakfast in particular, we think is a more localized support, as Kevin has already have mentioned.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. I just have a housekeeping one and then another question. Just on the 4,000 remodels you're doing this year, how many of those are full versus partial? And then, of the ones you're going to have left after this year, how many of those are going to be full versus partial remodels? And then, my other question is just, Steve, you talked about the average check being driven more by mix. Is that a conscious decision you're making to take the brand a little more upscale over time or is that sort of not how you're thinking about it?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: I'll take the first one.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Okay.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: The question about how many are modernized versus non-modernized or full versus partial, as you called it, I'd say this year should be relatively representative. It's about a third of what you'll call full are the complete and then about two-thirds of partial or where you just need the EOTF elements. We will probably and we're a little more skewed to McOpCo probably this year, so about half of our McOpCo estate or company-operated, are complete at this point. So it may be a little bit more front-loaded on the company-operated sites. But in general, it should be similar between the about a third full and about two-thirds partial this year and going forward.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: With the second half, no, I wouldn't describe it as a conscious effort to take the brand up-market. I mean we don't want to alienate anyone. And we will always stand for value. But as we continue to invest in the brand, as you invest in quality and the properness of our food, you invest in the physical real estate, as you invest in technology, what you tend to do is broaden your customer base. So I think really what we end up doing is appealing to a broader range of customers on more occasions, more often. That's what it's all about. We want to do the things that positively impact the most people in the most areas as possible, but I wouldn't say it's a conscious effort to take the brand up-market. Continuing to reinvest in the brand and keep it relevant for customers today is what it's all about. And it's a competitive marketplace. We want to differentiate ourselves from the competition and we believe we have some initiatives in place that will help broaden the gap between us and the others.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. I just have a follow-up on that and then also just want to know about \u2013 I know you don't like to talk about current trends, but there's been some news about these salads and things like that. I was just curious how that might have been resolved, impacted or how that might manifest itself in trends. But you also just mentioned about alienating a customer. Obviously, I don't think you purposely would want to ever chase away people. But could you sort of narrow down the drag that was referred to from the conversion? Is that manifesting itself in less frequency, you think, from your customers, or could you narrow that down to a specific cohort maybe of that lower income demographic that perhaps the value message has been a little bit diluted as you've been elevating the brand? And they could come back or have you just seen simply less frequency from your existing customers?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I'll take the salad one. Yes, I mean, obviously, I mean, food safety and the customer's well being is our absolute number one priority, first and foremost. So, as you know, we've been contacted by the public health authorities from Iowa and Illinois about certain infections across produce in those states. We have removed existing lettuce blend from the identified restaurants. It impacted around 3,000 restaurants, but as of July 23, so when was that? That's three days ago. All those restaurants have been fully replenished with a new supply and we continue to trade fully. So I wouldn't say that has a material impact on our trading performance. It's something you don't want to be associated with, so we take it very seriously. But from a trading perspective, it really hasn't been something that is particularly material.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: I'll take the second one. I tried talking in my script a little bit about kind of these two different customer groups. There is one customer group that we call, or that are called, budget basics, that are really looking for kind of everyday predictable low prices. And our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu has been successfully dealing or addressing those customers. Where we've had a little bit of gap, if you will, is these deal customers, who are people that love fast food, but they will go to several different outlets based on who's got the best deal or who has a really compelling deal. And I think that's the area where we haven't been as competitive as we've needed to be because some of our competition has stepped up on their deal side. And so we've talked about we need to make sure on the deal side that we're competitive so that those customers are \u2013 that's where we would have lost, I'll say, some frequency of customers, as you talked about. So it's really just having those customers come back to us more frequently because we've got the compelling deals on a regular basis.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Two on comps, first, just on the global comp or the global traffic, it declined for the first time in several quarters. And I know you called out the U.S, but I'm assuming U.S. is somewhat similar, at least on a comp basis, versus last quarter. So are there other international markets where traffic is still positive but maybe has decelerated worth calling out? I know you said South Korea. But are there other places that you're starting to see some traffic deceleration that would account for that global deceleration in traffic? And earlier this year, I think you reduced the advertising spend in the U.S. as part of the rollout of the $1 $2 $3 Menu. Do you think that's at all a root cause of perhaps some of the weaknesses or said another way, is there a need to reinvest in some advertising dollars in the U.S. as a way to drive traffic?\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I'd say from a guest count perspective, I mean, clearly the U.S. has come to be our largest market. And therefore, if that goes weak or goes negative, that tends to drag things down. Other somewhat more noticeable trends over the last, I would say, three months to six months have been China, where we're still getting like-for-like sales growth, but the guest count growth has gone negative in China through the quarter. The impact within that market on the uncertainty of the trade discussions has \u2013 I mean, clearly, it's hit the markets, which, in turn, hits consumer confidence. And so, we're keeping close to that and adjusting our plans, so we can be competitive there. And Russia continues to be hard work for us. So we're getting negative guest counts there at the moment and now we're making some changes with our team there, but also with our strategy there. So we can compete slightly more fully. On the advertising side, you're right. We reduced the contribution here in the U.S. for both Owner/Operators and the company. I don't think our issue is around the percentage contribution. I think what it takes is a little bit of time, that when you move from 180 co-ops down to 56 co-ops, when you move from 44 local marketing agencies to a roster of five local marketing agencies, there's just a transition time for it to settle down. So are we running at peak performance year-to-date in terms of just the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing? Probably not. Do we believe we have the structure in place where the contribution we make now, we believe should be certainly sufficient from a share of voice for internal marketing spend and, therefore, basically be more effective and more efficient? So there's no plans to change the marketing contribution. It's just what we do with it, which is most important.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. I know you don't comment or maybe can't control, I should say, staffing levels for franchisees in the U.S. or what franchisees pay their labor, but I just want to have a sense of the overall staffing environment that the franchisees are facing on a market-by-market basis and if you think the current labor market in any way is affecting some of your execution levels that maybe you alluded to in terms of fresh beef being a little bit slower through the drive-thru or any other factors in terms of processing peak hour transactions.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, John, it's Kevin. That's a good and fair question. I'd say labor staffing, it's a tight labor market out there. I think it's fair to say. And so, labor staffing is a challenge, both for us and the franchisees. But that's the industry. So I don't know that we have it any worse than anybody else. And I don't know that we can or should or do use that an excuse. I do think it is a tough labor market right now to make sure you've got the right staffing levels. And maybe because we're going through EOTF and all these other things right now, that you see a little bit of impact of that. But long term, we have to figure out that equation. We've got to be able to figure out how to be efficient with our labor and be able to operate effectively. Near term, I think it's a fair point. You know unemployment is obviously very low. And so, certainly, depending on state-by-state or area-by-area, it does have an impact. So we're trying to do everything we can to invest in our employees, to invest in training to make sure that we can attract the right labor force. But it's a challenge right now in the industry, I think.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: I think part of what we're doing because there is a fight for talent and it's not just the U.S., actually. It's in a lot of our mature markets, partly because there is less mobile labor. Let me put it that way. So there's less migration across Europe. With the impacts of Brexit, means there been an exodus of, if you like, service sector workers out of the UK. We can begin to see that impact here in the U.S. So we've got to fight that little bit harder to first of all, gain the talent and then retain it. So that's why we committed $150 million over the next five years to Archways to Opportunity, for example. We're actually providing education and training opportunities and career development and personal development opportunity to our people. So whatever we can do to try and differentiate ourselves from others in the service sector is really important to us right now. So we're doubling-down on, if you like, the added value that we can offer our employees as well as the day-to-day hour-to-hour work.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: The next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Kevin, it sounded like from your comments that the D $1 $2 $3 Value Menu may evolve to include some regional variation. I wanted to see if that was true. And then, also, is the plan to design local meal deals to be more competitive in lower cost markets where you see competition priced to that local market rather than a national level?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, Chris. Let me try a couple of things there. D $1 $2 $3, it's a national platform. There are and will be some options, if you will, that local markets, depending on where they are, can draw down and put on the $1 $2 $3 Menu. So you will see some items that are on in certain markets, depending on where they're located. So the general platform is national. There will be certain products that will be on nationally. But locally, people will have an option of, I'll say, either adding or swapping out a couple products, here and there.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: Deal.\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: The second part about deal, most of the deals will likely be national deals, so things like the two for $4 breakfast that we had. The two for $5 sandwich that we're going to have starting August and other deal platforms that we are anticipating, will generally be national platforms. So I think most of the deal will be at a national level.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: Okay. We've got time for one more question and that will be Matt McGinley with Evercore\nMatthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. My question is on the International Lead and looking at the level of comp you've had over the past handful of quarters and then looking at not a whole lot of margin flow through. Given your farther along with EOTF, and I don't think the investment levels are the same there, but I believe delivery is becoming a bigger part of the mix there. I'm curious if that could be having a bigger drag on the comp than perhaps other initiatives or other investments that you're making. And if that sort of spend continues, do you think that that same level of overall rule of thumb in terms of the comp growth would have the same level of impact on the earnings on a go-forward basis?\nKevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.: Yeah, Matt, I'll take that. I'd say we're really pleased with the comp growth that we've been getting in the International Lead markets because it's been pretty broad based. You see all five of the main markets in that International Lead segment doing pretty well. They're all in pretty good shape with Experience of the Future. Some of them, Germany and France, probably have a little bit ways to go, but the restaurants look really good. We're getting sales. In general, those markets, I guess from our perspective, we're throwing up franchise margins of 81% and McOpCo margins this quarter of over 21%. So I think, in general, we're pretty pleased with the level of margin. Now you do see a little bit of percentage hurt, I'll say, because of delivery, to your point. As delivery percentages and sales grow, the percentage margin on those is a little lower percentage because you've got commission to pay. But I'll certainly take the additional dollars we're getting from those sales to give up a little of that percentage. So I think we're pretty pleased with the margin flow through in those International Lead segment.\nStephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.: All I'd say on some of that is we're taking share in each one of those markets as well. So, yes, we want it to carry to the bottom-line. But from a competitive position perspective, we just got stronger and stronger compared to the rest. So it's the share gains, we know, are the long-term winner for us. But they are returning pretty good profitability and some great top-line and solid guest count growth as well.\nMike Flores - McDonald's Corp.: So that completes our call. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-04-30 17:54:06", "content": "Executives: Mike Flores \u2013 Investor Relations Steve Easterbrook \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ozan \u2013 Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Sara Senatore \u2013 Bernstein Andrew Charles \u2013 Cowen John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan David Palmer \u2013 RBC Brian Bittner \u2013 Oppenheimer David Tarantino \u2013 Baird Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Guggenheim John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Peter Saleh \u2013 BTIG Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Greg Francfort \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Alton Stump \u2013 Longbow Nicole Miller Regan \u2013 Piper Jaffray Jeff Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo Brett Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nOperator: Hello and welcome to McDonald\u2019s April 30, 2018 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.\nMike Flores: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I would like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter business performance as we continue to build momentum and grow customer visits with delicious food, compelling value, and enhanced convenience. We are managing our business for the long-term and with our Velocity Growth Plan, I am confident that our strategy and actions we\u2019re taking will position the business for sustained growth. The U.S. market has embarked on an aggressive plan and one of the most significant transformations in our history. Since the start of the year, the market has modernized and improved hospitality in nearly 1,000 restaurants, setting the pace to bring the Experience of the Future to an additional 1,000 restaurants every quarter this year. This is an aggressive pace. 1,000 projects would be like modernizing every McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Australia and we\u2019re doing that each and every quarter in the U.S. We\u2019ve introduced cooked right when ordered Quarter Pound burgers using fresh beef in thousands of our restaurants and trained hundreds of thousands of restaurant crew on our new procedures along the way. And we\u2019ve transitioned the entire market to a new value platform, offering our customers greater choice and variety. All of this has been accomplished while streamlining our marketing structure. We reduced our advertising co-ops from around 200 to just over 50, allowing us to be more agile in decision making and execution. Also we\u2019re becoming more efficient and effective as we shift to a more natural market approach. Our International Lead segment once again delivered strong results and they executed foundational elements of our plan in a majority of restaurants. These markets are providing better food, value, and convenience for our customers and capturing more of the potential from their growth initiatives. So what do I mean by this? The markets established a solid foundation that starts with strong local leadership and franchisee alignment and also leverages delicious food at the core of our menu, effective value strategies, rooted in deep consumer insights, and great running restaurants. These markets then layered in multiple platforms to accelerate and sustain growth with modern and appealing restaurant designs, both inside and out, that signal to our customers we care about our business and care about them. Optimized kitchens have expanded our capacity to serve more customers more quickly in a more productive and enjoyable work environment. Digital menu boards, self-order kiosks, and mobile apps that build awareness of the breadth of our menu and quality of our food. Enhanced drive-thru is helping us quickly serve more of our time-pressed customers whilst creating a culture of hospitality with table service that unlocks the potential of the investments in technology for capacity optimization by creating a low-stress, personalized experience. It\u2019s the layering of these foundational platforms which has strengthened the brand in these markets whilst building the capacity and capability to drive growth. We\u2019re seeing the results and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so confident in our ability to sustain momentum in these markets and it\u2019s what I look forward to in the rest of our system. Globally, we marked our 11th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales with growth of 5.5% in the quarter. Guest counts grew by 0.8%, marking our 5th consecutive quarter of positive global guest count growth. We\u2019ve listened to what our customers are saying by millions of surveys each month and they are telling us that we\u2019re getting noticeably better with fast and friendly service and great-tasting food. Satisfaction scores rose in 2017 and the positive trends continued into 2018. The most significant improvements were in Japan, France, Australia, and Canada, where in many cases we\u2019re seeing double-digit increases in the key measures of customer satisfaction. With these improving customer perceptions, guest count growth, and market share gains, we are building brand strength which fuels future growth. Now Kevin will walk you through more details about our sales performance during the quarter.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve. Our comp sales performance for the quarter was strong. Steve and I talk about the size and scale of McDonald\u2019s. To put our 5.5% comp sales increase in perspective, it equates to over $1 billion of growth across the system for the quarter. Each of our operating segments contributed to this growth, with the first quarter also benefiting from a shift in the timing of Easter and related school holidays. U.S. comp sales increased 2.9% for the quarter, with a positive comp GAAP of 270 basis points versus QSR sandwich competitors excluding McDonald\u2019s. Sales were fueled by higher average check, driven by two primary factors; menu price increases as part of a broader strategic pricing reset of the menu board, and favorable shifts in product mix, consisting of trade-up to new premium products and a higher number of items per order for $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu transactions. One of our challenges in the U.S. is consistently growing comparable guest counts, especially when current overall industry traffic is negative. U.S. guest counts declined in the first quarter due to the very competitive breakfast day part and our conscious decision to simplify our value platform, eliminating most local value offers. We remain focused on executing our plan to deliver guest count growth through offering the appeal to customers, as well as taking actions to grow our breakfast business. In the International Lead segment, comp sales were up 7.8% with positive comp sales and guest counts in all markets. Leading the segment, the UK maintained momentum and posted its 48th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. That\u2019s 12 years of uninterrupted quarterly growth in one of our largest and most competitive markets. Germany delivered its best guest count performance since 2005. Drivers of this growth included a fun digital Easter Countdown Calendar promotion and the successful Taste of McDonald\u2019s campaign, featuring products such as the Big Mac and Royal TS Burger. And Canada continued to gain market share across most day parts, supported by continued success of all-day breakfast and premium products such as the Seriously Chicken lineup. Comp sales for the high-growth markets increased 4.7%, led by continued strong performance in China and Italy. Italy experienced its best quarter in both comp sales and guest counts in the market\u2019s history, driven by digital engagement and the My Selection platform, featuring local ingredients on our premium burgers and chicken sandwiches. And in the Foundational segment, comp sales were up 8.7%. In addition to Japan\u2019s continued strong performance, comp sales were positive in each of the segment\u2019s geographic regions.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks, Kevin. Our strong broad-based performance illustrates the traction we\u2019re gaining across the system with our Velocity Growth Plan. This gives us confidence we\u2019ll continue to drive business momentum as we scale what\u2019s working. We have strong market leadership teams which have effectively adapted the plan based on local customer insights, driving greater relevance and impact with the food we serve, the value we offer, and the experience we provide. We are reclaiming leadership and serving great-tasting burgers through product innovation and elevating our core offerings. This year, around the system, we\u2019re celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Big Mac. We\u2019re reenergizing the brand and rekindling the passion our customers have for this iconic and delicious sandwich. Many markets are extending the line, offering a limited time trio of Mac Jr., the classic Big Mac, and Grand Big Mac. In the UK, this was a key growth driver for the quarter, with Grand Big Mac sales far exceeding any promotional beef sandwich previously offered in the market. The Quarter Pounder with Cheese is another iconic core burger with tremendous potential. The U.S. is going after this in a big way with the national launch next week of Fresh Beef, cooked right when ordered in our quarter pound burgers. We have already been serving these sandwiches in select markets throughout the U.S. and the response has been very encouraging. In our pilot markets of Dallas, 90% of customers who tried the burgers said they\u2019d buy them again. These initiatives, on top of the improvements we\u2019ve made to our core chicken products and the scaling of all-day breakfast in Australia and Canada, reinforce the notion that our core menu remains a strong growth driver for our business. Additionally, most markets grew traffic and check with strong premium burger offerings, like Gourmet Creations in Australia and Mighty Angus in Canada. Across the McDonald\u2019s system, value is foundational to our business and an integral part of our growth plan. Our strategic brand of iconic and relevant value platforms and high-impact deals drove traffic during the quarter. The $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu is the platform that anchors our value strategy in the U.S. With the introduction of this menu at the start of the year, we\u2019re offering customers choice and variety for a simplified menu at multiple price points. It\u2019s performing in line with expectations as customer awareness continues to grow and, as Kevin mentioned, $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu was a key factor in higher average check for the quarter. In France, the market is providing great taste at a low price with P\u2019Tit Dej\u2019 and complete lunch meals under \u20ac5 with Menu McFirst. With this successful varied approach, McDonald\u2019s France achieved a 6th consecutive quarter of guest count growth and an all-time high per share in the IEO market. During the quarter, we also drove sales, traffic, and brand excitement with the continued expansion of our velocity accelerators. As we enhance the customer experience and provide greater convenience for our Experience of the Future, delivery, and digital initiatives, we\u2019re learning more about what is most important to our customers and rapidly scaling what works. Table service, which was developed in France, and enhanced hospitality, which was perfected in Canada with their guest experience leader program, have proven to be critical drivers of customer satisfaction. This has helped us unlock the potential of our self-order kiosks to build capacity, frequency, and average check. We\u2019ve achieved a critical mass of POT at deployment in Australia, Canada, and the UK and are well on our way to being there by year-end in Germany and France. The U.S. remains on pace to have POT at deployment in about half of the market\u2019s 14,000 restaurants by year-end, integrating the best approaches that we\u2019ve learned from the International Lead markets. Regarding another of our accelerators, more than 11,500 restaurants now offer delivery. Whilst we continue to expand the base of participating restaurants, we\u2019re working closely with Uber Eats and our other partners to optimize the model, building awareness, trial, and more frequent repeat orders, and, most importantly, customer and career satisfaction. In most of our major markets, delivery is already a meaningful contributor to overall comparable sales. With mobile order and pay now active in over 20,000 restaurants, we\u2019ve turned our focus to building customer awareness, encouraging more app downloads, and driving active usage. One great example of this is Germany. As Kevin previously mentioned, the market had great success as it launched the McDonald\u2019s mobile app with an Easter Countdown Calendar, offering 32 straight days of different and compelling offers only available through the app. This generated over 5 million downloads, making it the most downloaded app in Germany in February, and it drove business results: double-digit comp sales increases and the best guest count growth in 12 years. The success we\u2019re already seeing across the system reinforces my confidence that we still have significantly more potential in our plan. Our market leadership teams are focused on what works and we\u2019re sourced to execute for impact. Now Kevin will provide additional financial highlight for the quarter.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Steve. As I mentioned earlier, our comp sales growth for the quarter reflects our broad-based strength around the world. Earnings per share for the quarter grew 12% in constant currencies to $1.72. EPS was impacted by $0.07 for some adjustments to amounts we recorded in 2017 as a result of tax reform. Excluding this impact, EPS was $1.79, an increase of 16% in constant currencies. Sales leverage offset the drag of refranchising activity and we saw benefits from a lower tax rate and FX, which I\u2019ll cover in a few minutes. As we review our operating results, I want to remind everyone that for the first half of this year, we\u2019re comparing against China and Hong Kong results prior to refranchising those markets in the third quarter last year. As we anticipated, we\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of our more heavily franchised business model in our operating margin, as it grew from around 36% in the first quarter last year to nearly 42% this year. Looking at the components of operating margin, the impact of positive comp sales growth, coupled with refranchising, drove a 60 basis point increase in our franchise margins, which now represent over 80% of margin dollars. Where the most significant refranchising activity in 2017 was developmental license fees, we expect that most of the refranchising this year will be conventional franchising. We also expect that most of this activity will occur in the first half of the year. Looking at 2018 and beyond, we still have a few markets that we\u2019re exploring to potentially refranchise via the developmental license model. Moving along to company operating margins. Consolidated margins declined 150 basis points to 16% for the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the China/Hong Kong transaction in 2017 along with wage increases in most of our major markets. In the U.S., company operating margins increased 50 basis points to 15.8%, driven by positive comp sales, a lower advertising contribution rate, and refranchising activity, which helped us overcome higher wage rates and commodity costs this quarter. Turning to pricing and commodities, our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was slightly below food away from home inflation of 2.5%. I mentioned that commodity costs were higher in the U.S. for the quarter. They were up just over 2% versus last year. We continue to expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase about 1% to 2% for the full year, reflecting less commodity pressure in the back half of the year. Similarly, we expect commodity pressures to ease in the International Lead markets in the back half of 2018. While commodities increased about 3% in the first quarter year-over-year, we continue to expect costs for the full year to increase about 2%. Our menu prices in the International Lead markets were up just over 2% for the quarter. Continuing on to G&A, G&A for the first quarter was down 1% in constant currencies. We expect our G&A to increase around 5% in the second quarter as a result of costs related to our worldwide convention earlier this month and our corporate headquarters move in May. And we continue to expect our full-year G&A to decrease about 1% in constant currencies. Our effective tax rate was about 27% for the quarter, reflecting $52 million of adjustments as a result of tax reform that I mentioned earlier. Excluding these adjustments, the tax rate was around 24.5%. While we may have additional adjustments this year as the guidance on tax reform continues to evolve, we still expect our full-year tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range. Turning to foreign currencies, for the quarter, foreign currency translation benefited EPS by $0.08 per share. At current rates, we anticipate a slightly lower benefit from foreign currency for the second quarter and about $0.19 to $0.21 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year. Our broad-based strength is a reflection of the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and we\u2019re confident that the actions we\u2019re taking will continue to drive growth, both for today and the long-term. And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: During the quarter, we made a series of announcements intended to help us maintain and build trust with our customers. With our Scale for Good framework, we are elevating a select group of global priorities where we believe we can make the greatest difference and drive industry-wide change. McDonald\u2019s is stepping up to address major social and environmental issues that matter most to our customers, franchisees, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Scale for Good is not a separate corporate responsibility platform, but rather an initiative embedded in our growth strategy. We\u2019ve set goals to reduce packaging and increase recycling, take bold actions related to kids\u2019 nutrition, and support producers in developing more sustainable approaches to raising beef. McDonald\u2019s is the first global restaurant company to address climate change by setting a real target to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. And we\u2019re expanding on our longtime commitment to restaurant crew and managers. Last month we announced that we will increase our investment up to $150 million over five years to our global Archways to Opportunity education program. With Scale for Good, our goals extend beyond our direct reach. With initiatives such as beef sustainability and operating more energy-efficient restaurants and offices, we\u2019re working across our supply chain and collaborating with thousands of franchisees, suppliers, and producers. Whether it\u2019s with Scale for Good or other partnerships, McDonald\u2019s possesses a convening power like no other company in our sector. A prime example is the announcement during the quarter of a new alliance between McDonald\u2019s and the Walt Disney Company. Building on our goal to offer more nutritionally balanced Happy Meals, Disney and McDonald\u2019s will collaborate with cross-promotional campaigns involving movies from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studies, Disney Live Action, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm. This alliance combines two of the most iconic and beloved brands for families and we\u2019re excited by the fun and innovative opportunities it will create for engaging with customers. Over the past couple of years, you\u2019ve heard us talk about our higher appetite for calculated risk, greater personal accountability, and growing ambition. We\u2019re asking a lot of everybody in the McDonald\u2019s system. As is certainly the case in the U.S., where we\u2019ve developed an ambitious plan over the past year with our franchisees. It\u2019s going to be hard work and we\u2019re taking on a lot at once. This is what it takes to keep pace with today\u2019s rising customer expectations. The McDonald\u2019s system is up for the challenge, we\u2019re fit for purpose, and we\u2019ll continue to get better. We\u2019ve seen the results when our other markets have executed strong plans and we\u2019re confident about the U.S. Let me tell you why. Franchisees, suppliers, and corporate staff are energized and enthusiastic about our future. As I talked with many of them recently at our worldwide convention in Orlando, Florida, I was struck by their deep sense of commitment to our customers and robust determination to maintain our momentum. The convention was an occasion for the entire McDonald\u2019s system to reflect on the progress of our business over the past two years and a large amount of the strategy guiding our future. The 15,000 people attending our convention were eager to share and learn the best approaches in our top-performing markets and restaurants. We have one of the world\u2019s most powerful brands and with the Velocity Growth Plan, confidence is growing throughout the McDonald\u2019s system that we can make it even stronger. We\u2019re ambitious and hungry to unlock even greater potential remaining in our plan. As we look to maintain this pace in the quarters ahead, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on track to strengthen our leadership position. The McDonald\u2019s system is fully aligned and engaged, from the crew members in our restaurants to our franchisees to our suppliers and corporate staff, we are committed to showing our customers every day how we\u2019re becoming a better McDonald\u2019s. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike to lead Q&A.\nA - Mike Flores: Thank you, Steve. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] And now the first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Thank you very much. Just on the U.S. comp, if I may, you pointed out that traffic is a priority. There was some softness in the breakfast day part. And also just in terms of the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu, since it\u2019s driving average check, it sounds like maybe it\u2019s adding to existing customer orders but maybe not bringing in new customers. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the tweaks you might be making. Is it on the value side? And, if not, in terms of breakfast, where do you think you\u2019re losing the customers? Is it to kind of coffee shops? Is it to other QSRs? Just trying to understand the complexion of the U.S. comp.\nSteve Easterbrook: Sure. I\u2019ll start, Sara. I think the reality is footfall is down. So I\u2019m not sitting here thinking that there\u2019s share going to any particular competitor. It\u2019s just a market share fight overall. So as you say, we\u2019re going to continue to sharpen our plans. And if you want to talk about, for example, the value platform, this is the most significant value platform launch we\u2019ve had in probably more than ten years. So it takes a while for the customers to get familiar with the new menu. And we\u2019ve got three or four items each at $1, $2, and $3. And, yes, we\u2019re getting a better understanding now of how customers are buying from that menu. And as we\u2019ve seen, we know it can build average check, so we\u2019re selling more items per order than we were previously. But we\u2019re also still very keen just to get that single dollar customer come in at the real value end as well. So I think you\u2019ll just see us continuing to make sure that we can highlight the range we have. But actually we\u2019ve got some absolute knock-out products on our $1 and $2, like our $3 Happy Meal, for example. So I think we\u2019ll keep finessing it. There is flexibility there. We\u2019re changing media weights. We\u2019re changing some of the creative work as well on the marketing side, to better have some of the stronger items just pop out a little bit more from a customer perspective. But we\u2019re satisfied with where we\u2019re at. Although we don\u2019t want to get the guest count piece moving again and we\u2019ve never made any secret of that.\nMike Flores: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. Two parts to my question. Just a follow-up on the first question. What\u2019s the diagnosis behind the soft morning sales and did the two for $4 Breakfast promo meet your expectations given the backdrop of softening morning day part? And then I know you\u2019re not prepared to discuss the lift you experienced from Hot off the Grill, the fresh beef initiative in the test markets, but from a timing perspective, did this initiative lead to a faster lift in sales in test markets relative to what you saw with the $1, $2, $3 rollout earlier this year? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: So the two for $4 Breakfast meal was \u2013 the first thing I want to do is highlight something that really encourages me, which is how nimble the U.S. system now is. We have sometimes been a little bit slow to be able to effect change and the guys could see where the market was going. Breakfast was competitive. With the owner/operators, they created a device, the two for $4 deal. And we\u2019re satisfied. We think that makes us much more competitive in the breakfast day part so I can see continued enthusiasm for that. For fresh beef, we really have not put any advertising weight behind it yet. So in the test markets, what we were getting more of was the understanding of the operational consequences, so we could best train our people, and certainly the customer feedback at a restaurant level was absolutely fantastic. So we haven\u2019t attempted to drive sales with it yet so we haven\u2019t put the marketing dollars behind it. But that\u2019s going to change soon now that we\u2019ve rolled this out across the entire state. We\u2019re ready to go. And if you haven\u2019t tried it, you\u2019ve got to try it. It just tastes great. Honestly, it\u2019s a hotter and juicier Quarter Pounder and customers are really enthused about the noticeable difference it makes.\nKevin Ozan: Hey, Andrew, the only other thing I\u2019d say is, just as perspective that two for $4 breakfast that you talked about didn\u2019t go in until mid-March. And so it really didn\u2019t have a meaningful impact on first quarter results. It\u2019ll really have more of an impact related to second quarter.\nMike Flores: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Great. Thank you. First, how much was the calendar shift a benefit, I think particularly to International Lead, which is where I would suspect it would be the highest? And then secondly, for the main question, what can we learn from International Lead in terms of various initiatives that that collection of markets may be ahead of the U.S. that could be a leading indicator to future U.S. sales and comp performance? If you could just highlight a couple and where we are in terms of rollout for International Lead versus U.S.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I\u2019ll start with the calendar shift and then Steve can talk about learnings from the IL. It\u2019s actually different by market. Certainly Europe had a bigger impact than places like the U.S. Germany, for example, has one of the bigger impacts, more related to school holidays actually than the Easter timing, but they obviously are correlated. So it was certainly a benefit in the first quarter and we\u2019ll see that benefit, if you will, reverse in the second quarter.\nSteve Easterbrook: John, I\u2019ll take the second one. Because you\u2019re absolutely right. I think what\u2019s really created the confidence to put such a bold plan together for our U.S. business has been what they\u2019ve seen and what we\u2019ve all seen with the International Lead markets. So one of the benefits we do have here now is, as we are rolling out thousands of projects per quarter \u2013 so, I mean, it really is a phenomenal project management exercise and change management exercise. We have so much learning now from Australia, Canada, and UK, in particular, the most advanced, the sort of details that we can get into and share now, which helped the U.S. from a learning perspective. Things like the real nitty-gritty stuff. So with the self-order kiosks, what\u2019s really important about the self-order kiosk is not just the customer-facing user interface but actually physically where you position them in a restaurant, for example. So you can better understand customer flow. It provides another ordering option for a customer apart from the front counter. So the devil is in the detail, as you expand as rapidly as we do and we\u2019re investing as much as we are. But things like training programs. Understanding the best way we can train both kitchen crew and also front of house and the hospitality. So part of what we have committed to, to our U.S. business, is we will literally just pick up and share the best practices. And we still think there\u2019s more the International Lead markets can get out of some of the initiatives of Experience of the Future. So we\u2019re going to continue to really squeeze it hard and get as much out of it as we can. But I think what gives us confidence is the U.S. doesn\u2019t need to make any of the mistakes that we made in some of the early days as we\u2019re learning some of these initiatives. We have a proven model now and we can just get into that groove of 1,000 projects a quarter and we\u2019re excited about what it\u2019s going to do for the business.\nMike Flores: Next is David Palmer, RBC.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on that phenomenal momentum in your leadership markets. Perhaps you can make a highlight on the UK market, why that one is so particularly strong. We\u2019ve heard about such tough weather conditions there. I would imagine that you\u2019re outperforming the eating-out market there, particularly by a wide margin. But a separate question on the $1, $2, $3, I\u2019m just trying to understand where you\u2019re coming from on this one. You said it\u2019s performing in line with expectations but that traffic was negative in the quarter. Are you going to probably keep the architecture the same on the $1, $2, $3 going forward, confident that it will build in momentum and acceptance with the help of some of the premium innovation that you have coming? Or do you think that this is something that you\u2019ll continue to tweak along the way? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks, David. So, the UK, they\u2019re on a real roll. And we do call them out from time to time because they\u2019ve really gathered some fantastic momentum. I think ultimately what they\u2019re benefiting from is not just the motivated owner/operators and the investments we bring into our restaurants, but actually for many years, they have really been very good at putting attention to building the brand as well. It\u2019s a competitive marketplace. It\u2019s facing many of the societal challenges and business challenges that we face elsewhere in the world. But they really are beginning to reap the benefits of long-term sustained investment in the brand, as well as just in the core business. And, yes, they\u2019re taking plenty of market share. They\u2019re in a very dominant position and I think it would be tough to be a competitor of McDonald\u2019s in the UK. They really are firing on all cylinders which is great. For the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu, I think the architecture, you could expect to see it pretty much the same. Yes. As I say, we\u2019re understanding more about how customers are buying from it and what they see. Could we rotate one or two items on and off it? Yes, absolutely, that was always part of the plan so we can always keep it fresh and have got something new to talk about. But fundamentally we\u2019re satisfied with where it is. Overall, we\u2019re not satisfied with guest counts being down. But the role the Dollar Menu plays and the way it \u2013 the influence it has on our overall product mix is where we want a value platform to be.\nMike Flores: Next is Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just with fresh beef in the U.S., surely it must provide a tremendous perception with the quality of your Quarter Pounders. But the question I have is, is there any risk that it puts a shadow on the rest of your beef menu at all? Or are you just simply not seeing this anywhere where you\u2019ve tested it?\nSteve Easterbrook: Brian, it\u2019s a good question. It was actually one of the things we were very mindful of when we actually established the test in the first place. And we wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any other sort of, as you say, shadow or reflection on the rest of the menu. But customers really did not create any concern for us whatsoever in the way that they interpreted what we are doing. They were just saying if you could help make the Quarter Pounder taste even better, good for you. You\u2019ve got our backs. So we didn\u2019t see anything to cause us any concern. That\u2019s why we did have a robust test. I mean, we\u2019ve been testing this for about 12 to 18 months so we\u2019ve got a really good read from a customer basis now. And they\u2019re just saying good on you. If you can just make this taste better then bring it on.\nKevin Ozan: And what we actually saw in our test markets was sales of Quarter Pound burgers went up but also sales of our overall burger lineup increased. So even the burgers that weren\u2019t using fresh beef in our test markets of Tulsa and Dallas saw an increase during the pilot test phase.\nMike Flores: Next up is David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Just one clarification on the U.S. comp for Q1 and then a question on mobile ordering. So the first, a clarification, I know you don\u2019t like calling out weather issues but the winter was pretty tough in the U.S. So did weather impact the Q1 comp and, if so, do you have an estimate for that? And then secondly, on mobile ordering, I was just wondering, Steve, if you could give us an update on the adoption rate you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. It seems fairly modest from my view so far but I guess where are you on that and what\u2019s the plan to drive better adoption given that could be a pretty big unlock for throughput? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I\u2019ll start with weather and then Steve can take the digital stuff. You\u2019re right. We generally don\u2019t like to call out specifically weather. It did negatively impact first quarter. I guess I\u2019d say maybe a little over a half a point would be approximate quantitatively. But we\u2019re generally not big plans of calling plus or minus the weather. But it certainly impacted us here. And surprisingly it actually had an impact in Europe, too, because Europe, for those of you who follow, had some rough weather during the first quarter also. But that\u2019s kind of quantitatively about how much it impacted us.\nSteve Easterbrook: We\u2019ve had a couple of relatively gentle winters prior to this as well. So I think this was just a little bit more of a typical weather pattern across it so we\u2019ve just got to get on with it. It\u2019s just the way it is. So for mobile ordering, current adoption is pretty low actually, David. So the platform is getting more reliable. We\u2019ve still got things we\u2019re trying to improve on our end, from the user experience perspective and training our teams in the restaurants and just getting the technology more reliable. But the adoption is still relatively low. We\u2019re certainly seeing the curbside pick-up being the most favored benefit that customers are seeing from it. But we\u2019ll continue to work away on it. It\u2019s not anything that we\u2019re going to put a massive emphasis behind, in terms of anything promotional, for example. However I think it\u2019s pretty inevitable that our customers will increasingly engage with us as a brand and as a business through their phones. So the fact that we\u2019ve got a product out there that\u2019s decent at the moment, I think there\u2019s a lot of upside. And we\u2019re excited about the potential but, at the moment, we\u2019re not seeing it drive significant business for us.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Just a bookkeeping question and then a question on delivery. Did you guys specify how much that is in the U.S.? And then just looking at the U.S. store margins from the company side, I wonder is that a good trend to follow, as far as if you wanted to look at what the franchisees are experiencing, as far as the margin fall off in the U.S. stores? Or is that just more of a difference in mix? Because it sounds like the value menu that you\u2019re launching would be favorable. Given what it\u2019s done to the check and other methods through the income statement, if that would be favorable to the franchise margins?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I\u2019ll take this. We won\u2019t quantify exactly what delivery \u2013 I\u2019d say delivery certainly contributed to the U.S. comp in the first quarter, as it did at the end of the year last year. We would hope and expect that to continue to grow as sales grow on the delivery side. So it\u2019s a meaningful contributor to the comp. On margins, a couple things relate to the U.S. margins. One, and you just mentioned this, but most of the comp or effectively all of the comp is really driven by check, which by definition brings with it then a positive impact on the margin side, because you get a bigger flow through, certainly from price than on the guest counts. Although that\u2019s not the way we\u2019d want it to work long-term. So the fact that check is driving comps is helping margins. That would also be helping the franchisees margins. The lower advertising contribution rate that we mentioned, that would be helping both us and the franchisees also. One of the things that helped us specifically was some refranchising that we\u2019ve done, really over the last year in the U.S., where we sold some underperforming restaurants, as the franchisees can generally run those better than we can. Obviously that piece wouldn\u2019t add to the franchisees margin. And then the other piece certainly is labor wages that are impacting both of us. So, in general, most of the benefit that we saw in margins would also be helping them. Again, other than the refranchising benefit which, to us, was a significant benefit that they wouldn\u2019t realize.\nMike Flores: Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. My question is on the Experience of the Future. And Steve, you mentioned you\u2019re accelerating the rollout of it in the U.S. So, first of all, is there a risk or did it impact at all same store sales in the first quarter, as either restaurants are closed or maybe crews are somehow distracted? Can you maybe talk about how you frame that potential impact to the business on the short-term? On the long-term, it seems like, if you\u2019re doing about 4,000 units this year and maybe therefore another 4,000 units next year, you might be able to get this done faster than you thought. Is this an acceleration, I guess, is the question versus the prior pace or is this just about where you thought it would be?\nSteve Easterbrook: No, we have upped the pace a little bit, John. I think we spoke about it actually over the last \u2013 earlier quarters as well. I think with some of the benefit we have seen from tax reform, it enabled us to, if you like, frontload the project and we\u2019ve got our orders lined up so we expect to make significant headway in basically the next two years, 2018 and 2019. And we will have a substantial amount of the estate complete by then. In terms of the impact, yes, it does hold back the like-for-like sales a little bit because we\u2019ve got 1,000 projects. And it depends how long the \u2013 depending on how the restaurant currently looks does dictate how long the project lasts. And it\u2019s one of those \u2013 I should really have mentioned that earlier. One of the benefits we\u2019re seeing from the International Lead markets is we\u2019re getting pretty good about scheduling these restaurants so you can minimize the downtime. So you can get the maximum effect for the customer, minimize the downtime. But the restaurants can be shut for 10 days to 14 days for some of the more significant investment. So, yes, that does slow us a little bit on the like-for-like. It\u2019ll be fine once we start to get into the routine year-on-year because we\u2019ll be doing another 1,000 next quarter, another 1,000 first quarter of 2019. But this current year, it will hold us back on the comp side a little bit, yes. But as I say, we\u2019re playing the long game. We know what the upside can be. It\u2019s a small price to pay for the benefit we believe the business will have.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh: Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask on average check, globally and in the U.S. as well, and just your comfort level with what looked like globally, I think, a 4.7% increase. And I realize there are a lot of moving pieces across the globe in that number, considering the pricing rebasing that you\u2019ve done, but could you generally just talk about your comfort level with running an increase in check of that size? And is there any sort of longer-term check growth goal that we could think about for the business, either in the U.S. or globally?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I\u2019ll take that. Some of that is U.S. obviously and some of that\u2019s outside the U.S. Our general goal is to optimize menu prices across all our price tiers within a market. And we look at various factors within each market, including things like food inflation or food away from home, other cost pressures, whether that\u2019s labor or any other costs. The biggest thing is kind of what customers will accept based on that market, based on competition. And so it\u2019s really an attempt to balance guest count growth and average check growth. And like I talked about in the U.S. right now, we\u2019re a little bit more skewed on the average check side versus guest count than we would want. So we\u2019d like to make sure that we get the guest count growth. But, in general, we generally try and stay a little bit below food inflation as kind of an overall guide.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just to add another perspective to what Kevin\u2019s just said. What we\u2019re seeing, particularly once we\u2019ve made the investments in the Experience of the Future, clearly a number of those are customer-facing, but what we\u2019re also doing is adding some firepower to the kitchen as well, which means we can offer a different range and particularly at the Signature end of the business. So part of what we\u2019re seeing is, with a better invested restaurant, great hospitality, we\u2019re launching premium ranges more consistently across our lead markets and that\u2019s also driving average check as well. So there\u2019s a product mix piece. But it\u2019s the permissibility we get on price is \u2013 if you run a great restaurant, it looks great, and it\u2019s welcoming, great hospitality and table service, then people are willing to pay a little more as well. So I think we\u2019ve got a bit of that helping.\nKevin Ozan: And then the one other newer aspect, I\u2019ll say, over the last year or so would be delivery. Delivery check size is generally one and half to two times kind of our regular in-store check. So that\u2019s also helping drive average check up, kind of on a global basis.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the conversation around the Experience of the Future. I think historically you had discussed a mid-single digit sales lift in the first year. But now that you have a critical mass of restaurants, both domestically and internationally, can you talk about the comp performance and the margin performance in year two and beyond?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I can start on that. Certainly in the U.S., we wouldn\u2019t have year two and beyond. But internationally, what we\u2019ve seen historically that we\u2019ve talked about is generally mid-single digit sales lifts for restaurants that convert to the Experience of the Future when you compare it to the rest of the market that maybe hadn\u2019t put it in yet. And most of those markets also see continued comp growth in year two after that. So it\u2019s not a one-time benefit but kind of builds on itself. In the U.S., it\u2019s obviously much earlier days right now so we don\u2019t certainly have the year two. But even in the early days, right now what we\u2019re seeing is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen internationally, which is kind of that mid-single digit sales lift for the projects where we have full modernization, where we do a full remodel and add in all the EOTF components, if you will. The projects that have already been modernized and only add in the EOTF components, that\u2019s a smaller lift, more around 1%. But the ones where we have full modernization and EOTF, it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen internationally, which is that mid-single digit lift.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just maybe a two-part question on the refranchising and the ultimate worldwide operating margin that you referred to in your prepared remarks. On the refranchising side, it looks like you had close to $100 million in gains in the first quarter and it hasn\u2019t been that far off from that number in most of the quarters in 2017. So I\u2019m just wondering whether we should assume these type of gains continue or are we now in the very late innings of the refranchising and therefore the gains should moderate? And the related part is just as that impacts the broader operating margin. I think you mentioned your operating margin is right now at 42%, which was up 600 basis points, and that was in the first quarter. Presumably that\u2019s led by the refranchising but I\u2019m just wondering where you think that ultimately settles as you wrap up refranchising and what type of growth rate we\u2019d assume once the refranchising is done off of that. Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, thanks, Jeff. I think I mentioned in my remarks that we\u2019ll have more conventional \u2013 more of our refranchising in 2018 will be the conventional type versus a lot of the developmental license that we had certainly last year. And I also mentioned that most of that activity will happen in the first half of the year. So to your point, we had about $100 million of gains in the first quarter. I would expect relatively similar, maybe a little bit less, in the second quarter. And then it\u2019ll start easing off a little bit in the third and fourth because most of the activity this year is in that first half of the year. By the time we get to the full-year, it\u2019ll be a little bit \u2013 we expect it to be a little bit lower than what we would have seen last year. So I think earlier, in the last quarter, we said about $30 million to $40 million less. We\u2019re actually seeing gains on each transaction a little bit higher so it may turn out to only be $20 million less than last year. But it should be a little bit less than last year. And then it will kind of ratchet down more than that next year then. Sorry, then the operating margin. So what you are seeing in operating margin, a couple things. You\u2019re seeing the benefit of refranchising as we certainly converted China/Hong Kong last year in the big transactions. When we refranchised that, certainly it benefits operating margin. And then you\u2019re also starting to see the benefits of G&A management and the rest of our P&L. We\u2019ve talked about our long-term goal beginning in 2019 of being in the mid-40s on operating margin and in our mind we\u2019re still on track for that.\nSteve Easterbrook: I think the only thing I would add to Kevin\u2019s comments was, given the way that we\u2019ve restructured ourselves as a business now, with our International Leads markets, with the high growth, those are typically the markets that our company owns still. We actually have, literally restaurant by restaurant, we have a very clear understanding of our franchising plans, who would we be selling to and which restaurants we want to keep and operate ourselves as well because that\u2019s an important piece for us. So we really have got a very granular look now and we can drill down country by country to have a very, very clear and, I guess, strategic franchising plan looking forward now.\nMike Flores: Next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGreg Francfort: Hey, guys, two questions. Just one is on the macro backdrop in the European markets and can you talk about what\u2019s going on there and then maybe how sustainable you think that is. And then my second question is on the U.S. marketing side. Can you talk about your marketing weight during the quarter, whether or not you pulled forward any spending around the $1, $2, $3 and whether or not \u2013 we\u2019re hearing, I think, that the industry margin weights are up pretty substantially. How sustainable do you think that is? I know there\u2019s a lot there.\nKevin Ozan: There is a lot there. So what we\u2019re seeing Europe. I mean, typically we do want to look at mainland Europe, where we\u2019ve got clearly France, Germany, two very important markets for us. We\u2019re getting some really good momentum out of some of the mid-size markets, kind of the 500 restaurant style markets, like Italy and Spain. The Netherlands is growing strong. Typically we\u2019re not seeing any particular headwinds but nor are we getting any great tailwinds. There seems to be a little bit of calm has entered the markets after the kind of shock from the Brexit decision maybe a couple of years back. But it doesn\u2019t appear to be quite as disruptive as perhaps people feared. We are seeing differences in labor movements. There\u2019s less migration going on across Europe and we see that here in the U.S. as well. So there are some dynamics we\u2019ve got to pace into but, as a business environment, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly calm and our success is really just because of what we\u2019re choosing to do and we\u2019re being aggressive in each of those markets. In terms of our \u2013 yes, we did shift some of the media weight. The quarter was a lot more than just $1, $2, $3 here in the U.S. But, yes, we wanted to make sure that we \u2013 we wanted to get the awareness of the items, the awareness of the menu at really good levels quickly. Customer awareness of what the items actually on the Dollar Menu wasn\u2019t quite what we wanted so we did shift the emphasis a little bit on that. But I think there was a lot of competitive spend in the quarter as well. So I think we feel pretty good that we battled through a tough quarter. We\u2019ve certainly got plenty of gunpowder we can throw out as well and, if the others have struggled over their spend, then I guess that\u2019ll be something they\u2019ll deal with.\nMike Flores: Next is Alton Stump with Longbow.\nAlton Stump: Good morning or good afternoon. Congrats on the result. I guess just a question. It isn\u2019t difficult, of course, to get a higher ticket when you roll out new value platforms. So can you just kind of walk through what is driving that? I presume that means that the $3 bucket items are selling well or is there anything else going on there that is driving the higher ticket off $1, $2, $3?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I can start talking about that. A couple of things. So we\u2019re seeing people use the $1, $2, $3 Menu in a variety of ways. Some people will create a meal using some items from the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu. Some people will buy a combo meal that isn\u2019t on $1, $2, $3 then add an item from the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu as an add-on. So we\u2019re seeing people use the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu in various ways. And one of the things we\u2019re seeing is that the items \u2013 when people use $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu, the items per transaction in those transactions is higher than our average when people don\u2019t use that $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu. That is helping drive average check for those transactions. And so that\u2019s, in general, what we\u2019re seeing. And as Steve talked about earlier, we like the construct of that menu. And so it allows people to use it in various ways. And, again, we need to make sure people are aware of all the specific items in the menu, but general awareness of the menu is pretty good.\nSteve Easterbrook: And clearly we\u2019ve stayed pretty close to customers when you launch something like this. We\u2019re getting high satisfaction and value perception scores as well from the Dollar Menu, which is obviously important to us. So, yes, above average checks run a little higher is clearly helping support the business. But from a value perception point of view, customers are feeling good about it and are playing that back to us.\nMike Flores: And our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you. Good morning. My question is around commodities. So what pieces are, in the U.S., inflating that cogs basket up closer to 2% to 3%? And if that persists, will you address value differently? And was that any contributing factor to removing some of those local value deals that you talked about earlier? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Most of the increases for 2018 that we expect are in the main categories that you would expect: beef and chicken, primarily. Right now, those increases aren\u2019t enough that it would change any of our marketing plans or product plans or anything along those lines. Like I mentioned, the first quarter was probably \u2013 right now, it looks like the first quarter increase would be the highest increase in the U.S. that we\u2019d see for the year. So we anticipate that increase kind of dissipating as the year goes on. But it isn\u2019t to a level where it\u2019s driving any change in marketing or product plans for the year.\nMike Flores: Our next question is from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer: Thanks. Just following up on the U.S. restaurant level margin, does that 1Q margin fully reflect the cost headwinds from I guess both the wage rate inflation and your investments in labor? Or will those headwinds further build out into 2Q and the back half of the year?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. It does reflect certainly the wage rate, the cost, I\u2019ll say. What we have started seeing, to be fair, is that some of that labor initiative investment is starting to dissipate a little bit. Some of that related to training as we got ready for the fresh beef rollout and so now that we\u2019re kind of coming upon that, we\u2019re seeing some of that labor training investment starting to dissipate. So it\u2019s fair to expect that that will continue \u2013 that piece will continue to dissipate as the year goes on.\nSteve Easterbrook: And I think the other piece to add as well, this is kind of a shout out to the operations guys out there, is working really hard to minimize crew turnover as well. So we\u2019ve got the 90-day turnover down to a really good level at the moment because that\u2019s where hidden costs can sometimes come in if turnover gets out of hand a little bit. So the guys in the field, while there\u2019s a lot of change in the restaurants, we\u2019re working really hard with the investments we\u2019re making both on the pay side but also the training and education side for our crew and managers, and we\u2019re beginning to see that with the turnover being well managed as well.\nMike Flores: We\u2019ve got time for one last question and that will be Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Levy: Great, thank you. If we can revisit Greg\u2019s question on the competitive landscape in Europe and if you can share a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of IEO growth and competitors\u2019 rational or irrational behavior. In other words, how much of what we\u2019re seeing from McDonald\u2019s successes are coming solely from what you\u2019re doing and how much of it might also be a little bit of a tailwind? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. I\u2019ll start and Steven can chime in. What we\u2019re actually seeing in most of the international markets is that we\u2019re gaining market share. And just about all of those are big, major markets, I\u2019ll say. Competitive landscape certainly varies by market. Some of the markets are a little bit more competitive than others. I\u2019d say overall IEO market in most of those countries is relatively muted. You\u2019re not seeing gang busting growth in any of those countries. So it\u2019s relatively muted which makes it competitive to have to gain market share. And in most of those we are seeing improvements in our market share.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, if there is any growth in the sector at all, it\u2019s typically on new units. And we have been a little bit more modest on new additions because we prioritized the reinvestment in the existing estate. But I think really that it\u2019s a zero sum game. It is literally a market share fight, I think, in all of our major markets. There is no one market, whether it\u2019s Australia, Canada, UK, Italy, Spain, none of those markets have macro tailwinds that\u2019s helping us lift. We\u2019re just literally scrapping hard, working hard, and taking share. So I think our gain is typically someone else\u2019s pain.\nMike Flores: Well, we\u2019ve reached the top of the hour so that concludes our call. I want to thank everyone for your great questions and we\u2019ll sign off.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation Investor Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-29 16:53:04", "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to McDonald\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2019 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us a little earlier this quarter. With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will open the queue for your questions. I ask that you please limit yourself to one question and if you have more than one please ask your most pressing first and then reenter the queue. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I will turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike and good morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. It\u2019s great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald\u2019s. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations from my first few months in this role. For the past 3 months, I have been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers, and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we are seeing behind our velocity growth plan. Our people are energized. They are proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction. This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system. We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald\u2019s gathering, there is a story to tell of the crew person, who is also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter in life working for McDonald\u2019s or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now in a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald\u2019s can change lives. We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald\u2019s whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you are entering more than just a restaurant, you are walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate, share stories, enjoy simple, but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has held friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress. Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions. As we have grown, we have recognized our responsibility as one of the world\u2019s leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe\u2019s most pressing challenges. It\u2019s the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald\u2019s to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world. Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results. Before that, I would like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone, $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we have seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. To put that in perspective, McDonald\u2019s and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours and owner/operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets and in the U.S. it\u2019s at an all-time high. Turning to segment highlights, our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. Importantly, our three largest IDL markets, China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we are now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history. For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5.0%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago. Across the country, we are seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018 putting a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization and more, were met with strong approval by our customers. This led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world, execute our strategies with such care and conviction. I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry and I am equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company is now Head of our U.S business, where he is responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returned to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated Markets, where we had oversight for McDonald\u2019s wholly owned markets outside the U.S. With Joe\u2019s transition, Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald\u2019s career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and has spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America. In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It\u2019s an important role for McDonald\u2019s as we maximize the full potential of our three-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth, while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture. I am thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles. Now, I will turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?\nKevin Ozan: Chris talked about our impressive full year results. So let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter. Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we have seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results. Our International Operated Segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter with strong performance across the segment. France and the UK drove the segment\u2019s growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings. The UK reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it. Turning to the U.S., comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing. Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world famous French fries continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners like DoorDash and GrubHub drove incremental orders and the deployment of Dynamic Yield\u2019s suggestive sell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point. Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributors to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies, when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year. Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion in the impact of refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard. Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter, primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1% and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF related depreciation. Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year. We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth. As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth. We increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. This also speaks to the progress we have made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we have evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. In 2019, our free cash flow $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buyback shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Now, I will turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we are headed in 2020.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. No word is the power of the Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. There I saw an engaged owner/operator who knew her customers by name and had made our modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs, some having a full meal, others just having coffee. With the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great tasting food with good value convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner/operator and many others across France and other international markets are growing visits. A similar dynamic is playing out in the UK, where our system is doing a great job meeting customer\u2019s expectations for convenience and speed, while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery. This dynamic is playing out in Italy where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all three peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It\u2019s a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver. At the same time, there is a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our three accelerators: Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery. With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests. Meanwhile, our digital journey, another critical accelerator is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald\u2019s by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we have significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2020. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences. Throughout the year, we made target investments to accelerate our capabilities. A suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we are using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want. There is no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald\u2019s by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So, we know there is great potential with digital, but there is also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. I recently announced the creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading corporate strategy and business development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry leading digital experiences for our customers and they will partner with our global technology team to build new product roadmaps and technology solutions to fuel growth. With our third accelerator, we are bringing more customers the McDonald\u2019s they love with the convenience of delivery, today, about two-thirds of our restaurants worldwide nearly 25,000 offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald\u2019s Company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets including the U.S for the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth and the UK, where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial and we are doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention. As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we have reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. For this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019. Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond. Yet, we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption. The topics we have shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first, with great tasting food, convenience and value means collaborating with our franchisee community for successful local execution. That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth and provide new opportunities for McDonald\u2019s. To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: We head into 2020 from a position of strength. The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we will host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer term expectations. With our efficient business model in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid 40s range which includes the following: higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins. With most of our major refranchising effects complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019 with most of the gains in the second half of the year. And as we have become more efficient with G&A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, R&D spend and costs related to our Biennial Worldwide Convention. We expect G&A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year. Moving on to capital, we ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion in line with our expectations. As we have previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects. Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year substantially all in markets outside the U.S. We will spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets and our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China. So, while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we have shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher returning investments. As we enter 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver sustained, long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders. Now I will turn back to Chris to close.\nChris Kempczinski: We have been on an ambitious journey the last few years from turnaround to transformation. And through it all, we have made a path forward even as the landscape changes. With these changes, customer expectations evolve, placing new demands on the world\u2019s leading brands. We are ready for that challenge, embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make McDonald\u2019s a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve. As we enter 2020, we do so from a position of strength of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our Velocity Growth Plan, the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble, agile and open in new innovations and new possibilities. We have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020, including Worldwide Convention in April. On a final note, I would like to offer heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald\u2019s system who helped us achieve this milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales this past year. It\u2019s the sum of many things done right, everyday by every employee, supplier, franchisee and crew member around the world. I am proved of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we began a new year. With that, let\u2019s begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Chris, I know you and Joe are prioritizing U.S. traffic growth in 2020, but can you help outline your confidence this can be achieved? On the one hand, there\u2019s better alignment with operators at the start of this year versus a year ago, which is aided by the simplification efforts that you guys have put in place. But on the other hand, breakfast competition is set to intensify shortly here, will the same-store sales benefit from Experience of the Future likely to be lower in 2020 versus what you saw in 2019?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Andrew. So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the number 1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. One of the things that\u2019s, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. owner operator basis, it\u2019s largely a franchise \u2013 or it\u2019s largely a family business in the U.S. Over half of our franchisees are second and third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that\u2019s an important part of this. And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it\u2019s going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that\u2019s seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There\u2019s obviously a lot of focus and attention that we\u2019re going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest-of-day deal or rest-of-day value, that we need to be competitive on that. So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that, we did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not \u2013 it\u2019s too early to call a trend on this. We\u2019ve got to see this happen over four or five quarters. And so it\u2019s going to be something we\u2019re going to be paying attention to and I\u2019m sure you guys will be asking us about it as well. So more to come on that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: It seems like the industry has become a bit more promotional since the start of the year. Would you agree with that or is that typical for this time of the year? And then has your view changed at all in response to the current competitive environment in recent weeks as your competitor gets closer to rolling out breakfast?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, Eric. January is always a highly competitive time of the year. So I think the activity that we\u2019re seeing right now, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as being unusually pronounced. I think, again, this is always something that happened at the beginning of the year. But I think what you\u2019re talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share. Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There\u2019s very little traffic growth. In fact, if you\u2019re not growing units, you\u2019ve got a headwind there. So I think that\u2019s one recognition and certainly, you are seeing, I think, just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds. So I think between those two things, it has been a competitive environment, it\u2019s going to continue to be a competitive environment, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m seeing an uptick right now.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: My question is on some of the investments you made on the technology side. You made some pretty big bets across the last year or so, and it looks like you\u2019re sort of staffing up to support that technology investment with your G&A spending. So just wondering, one, are there more big investments on the horizon that you see as needed? And then two, have you considered recouping some of those investments or sharing some of the cost of your franchisees through a technology fee or something similar that others have put in place?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do two acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don\u2019t foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we\u2019ve got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with a drive-thru. It\u2019s fully rolled out in Australia. And we\u2019re seeing a comp lift, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done. Similarly, with Apprente, we\u2019ve got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. So I think what you\u2019re seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on \u2013 we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that\u2019s always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we\u2019re certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent and service on that. So I\u2019d say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth, and when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service. On the ongoing costs, the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee, we kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees. So that\u2019s been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don\u2019t see that model changing.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Just following up on that, in the U.S., Chris, how comfortable are you with the check growth that you\u2019ve experienced in 2019? It\u2019s more than 100% of the comp. Is it possible we would see the same kind of check growth in 2020? Or are you less comfortable given that it may hurt the value proposition for the brand? And if you are willing to share, what is the comp lift that you modeled for Dynamic Yield that you\u2019re experiencing currently?\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, John. One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the check growth that we\u2019ve gotten, it\u2019s really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We\u2019re seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you\u2019ve got a number of factors that are worked there. You\u2019ve got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order. You have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order. You have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk. You\u2019ve seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, D $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add-on activity. So I think, for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we\u2019re seeing out there, particularly on the labor side that does get priced through and so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we\u2019ve been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we\u2019ve just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that\u2019s what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now.\nKevin Ozan: And then regarding kind of quantifying the Dynamic Yield lift, we generally don\u2019t quantify specific components of our comp. What I would say is it will be potentially different in different countries. So right now, we\u2019re certainly getting a bigger lift from Dynamic Yield in the U.S. than in Australia. In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put a Dynamic Yield, there wasn\u2019t as larger a lift as we\u2019re certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately, so that we need \u2013 can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Can you just talk a little bit more about the CapEx strategy moving forward? When we met in December in New York, it sounded like there was somewhat of a pivot happening in how you were thinking about the CapEx strategy even past 2020. I believe you were really starting to see areas you could invest in moving forward that would maybe keep CapEx elevated. Can you just talk about this? And ultimately, what does your steady-state CapEx look like? And what year do you expect that to occur?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, Brian. So as we talked about, we always said \u201819 and \u201820 would be similar. So we had $2.4 billion in 2019, we\u2019ll have a relatively similar amount in 2020. And as we\u2019ve indicated, we expect CapEx to come down some in 2021. The one area that we\u2019re currently reviewing and evaluating is our international business and potential unit expansion there. As you know, our international business is very strong, we see very high returns on investments in new restaurants in those markets, and we believe there\u2019s further potential for unit growth in many of those markets. So we\u2019re currently evaluating the opportunity to invest in some of those new units outside the U.S. You\u2019ll see that we have gone up a little bit in our openings in 2020, growing about 1,400 new units that should, between those and the ones we opened in 2019, contribute roughly 1.5 to our sales growth. So that\u2019s the one area we\u2019re currently evaluating. I think as far as longer term, we want to get through this evaluation, then we\u2019ll talk further about that when we have our Investor Day later this year.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel.\nChris O\u2019Cull: My question is about value. It sounds like everyday value will be necessary to improve the systems\u2019 relative market share this year. And I believe franchisees are only required to feature a few items on the D $1 $2 $3 value menu. So how does the company convince franchisees to be more aggressive with everyday value given the cost pressures they\u2019re facing?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. I think it\u2019s not just everyday value that are \u2013 is part of the equation, there\u2019s also what we would call deal value, which is sort of the post on and off type of value. And so I think from our vantage point, it\u2019s probably going to be more of the latter in terms of how do we smartly and in a disciplined way, pulse deal value throughout the year on this, and where are there opportunities for us to do it that, in a way, can drive both traffic and can protect margins. So we\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations on that. As you would imagine, I\u2019m not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it. But I think back to a couple of the earlier points that we\u2019ve talked about here, there is strong alignment with the owner/operators the U.S. that we need to be in a situation where we\u2019re getting both transaction growth as well as check growth. And so it\u2019s up to us now to deliver on it, but I do think there\u2019s good alignment to it. And it\u2019s probably going to come more through deal than it is necessarily everyday value. I think we\u2019ve got a good everyday value platform embedded already.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: There has been some reports about you guys closing some stores in China. I wonder \u2013 I know you guys don\u2019t give specific guidance for the year, but can you sort of at least help us understand how much exposure the MCD shareholders have to that market, whether that\u2019s in a worldwide revenue or your operating income?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure, yes. Well obviously, the situation in China is fluid and it\u2019s concerning. Right now, as you would expect, our priority is really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we\u2019ve been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed, but 3,000 that are still open. We\u2019ve also, with the China team, we\u2019ve put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we\u2019re doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it\u2019s everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers in hospitals. We\u2019re doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it\u2019s really an \"all hands on deck\" effort from that vantage point. China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it\u2019s probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it\u2019s about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it\u2019s only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us and we\u2019re very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming, again, that it stays contained to China.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: A question and also a follow-up please. So just on the outlook for G&A, I think at the investor event last month, and certainly you reiterated just now, the sort of very case-specific reason to make acquisitions. But I mean, how should we think about tech spend going forward? I think the guidance for G&A this year was a little bit higher than I would have expected. I know some of that is the owner/operator convention. Maybe you could quantify that? But just from the perspective of should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward, sort of in that mid-single-digit range, more similar to labor than to other investments just trying to anticipate that? And then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner/operator cash flow this year in the U.S. Does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address or are franchisees more looking to kind of protect that after having had a couple of years of declining cash flows?\nKevin Ozan: Alright. I\u2019ll talk about the G&A first, and then I\u2019ll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&A, a couple of points, we have talked about how we\u2019ve gotten more efficient with our day-to-day G&A, and we\u2019re investing in technology and R&D, so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente. And the things we\u2019re investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials. So that\u2019s how we think about kind of some of these specific investments. We have decreased our overall G&A as a percent of sales from around 2.8% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2019. And roughly \u2013 today, roughly more than 10% of that G&A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend, so a chunk of that G&A is non-cash as it relates to prior year spend. We do \u2013 as you indicate, we expect full year G&A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments. But that\u2019s \u2013 because I\u2019m lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we now will have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we\u2019ve talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. And then I guess, the only other thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019re in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&A. But so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&A long term. So we don\u2019t think about it any differently today than I did a couple of years ago. But I do have \u2013 obviously, to your point, we had an increase in \u201819, we have a little larger increase in \u201820. But certainly, we don\u2019t expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward.\nChris Kempczinski: On the point about or question about franchisee cash flow, it\u2019s exciting when you see the system set a record for franchisee cash flow. And in 2019, in the U.S., they did so in kind of a resounding way. I mean, they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another $50,000 or something like that. So it\u2019s a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business. Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant and some of the capital investments that we\u2019ve been doing, it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about. So to me, it\u2019s more about the point that our U.S. owner/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that\u2019s also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going. And so that\u2019s going to require staying aggressive on the business, and I\u2019m confident they\u2019re going to do that.\nKevin Ozan: Sorry, Sara. The one other thing you asked about was convention, and I forgot about that, but convention \u2013 our operator convention that we have every other year is roughly $25 million to $30 million.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: So the question as we think about the 2020 financial performance, Chris, I know you mentioned you\u2019re starting the year strong from a top line perspective. On the flip side, I guess, you\u2019re talking about maybe some elevated G&A in the short term. So I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that in relation to your thoughts on achieving your long-term algorithm, which is for high single-digit EPS growth, I know you don\u2019t necessarily guide specifically to any one year, but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out, whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long-term growth. And within that, that return of cash that you mentioned, I know you finished your three-year target. I\u2019m just wondering whether, going forward, we should now just think of it as you\u2019re going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Let me hit \u2013 it\u2019s a couple of different things. Let me first talk about 2020. If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we\u2019ve given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020. Regarding cash return, we\u2019re fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a three-year period for cash return, but there is \u2013 but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChris Carril: So with so much attention focused on the morning daypart given the rollout of breakfast by a large competitor, how do you assess the opportunity to strengthen your competitive position in the other dayparts as breakfast becomes more of a focus for the industry?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. I think as you look at our business and you think about our 2020 plan, when I look at it, there is a good balance. I mean, we certainly have, I think, a pretty strong breakfast plan. We have a combination of menu news at breakfast. We have some service, things that we\u2019re really looking at driving at breakfast. And then certainly, we plan on remaining competitive from a value standpoint in breakfast. But there is a lot of other things that we still have on the calendar. And so if you think about a couple of years ago, we talked about really focusing on food and it was going to be a focus on burger, chicken and coffee. And I think you\u2019re going to see for us, in 2020, that there\u2019s going to be burger news, there\u2019s going to be things that we\u2019re doing there that continue to keep driving our QPC business, which really has been a standout performer for us the last couple of years. Obviously, a lot of discussion about chicken, don\u2019t want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there, but we\u2019re committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment, so you should expect something there. And then we do see opportunities as well around beverages, desserts. So as the year unfolds, I think you\u2019ll see us staying strong on breakfast, but it\u2019s not going to be at the expense of rest of day.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Just wondering if you could touch a bit more on operations and throughput and the opportunities there specific to drive-thru times, I think you touched on globally, perhaps how that\u2019s been progressing. So specifically in the U.S., maybe how much of an opportunity that is in 2020, and perhaps what part technology plays in improving the operations and those throughput times.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, I think in the U.S., I\u2019m really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019. As we talked about in our comments, we\u2019re at record customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. driven by operations, and we\u2019re seeing it broad-based across a number of ops metrics that we\u2019re looking at. The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. But I think what we\u2019re also excited about is we think there\u2019s more that we can do there. We think that there\u2019s certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it\u2019s a combination of activities. It\u2019s a combination of menu simplification moves. It\u2019s a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We are doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. And then technology is a component to that. I\u2019d say right now, in 2020, I don\u2019t see technology necessarily being a huge part of what\u2019s going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service, rather. We have ZOOM timers, which is an internal thing that we use, that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thrus. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that\u2019s now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it\u2019s going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. Longer term, we\u2019re obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we\u2019ve done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we\u2019re able to get that commercialized and deployed, that\u2019s certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future.\nMike Cieplak: We have time for one more question from Greg Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGreg Francfort: This is kind of a two-parter. But just in terms of the check, I know I might be beating a dead horse here, but just can you quantify how much of that is spend per customer versus customers per ticket, as we try to think about maybe framing up like 7% check is not actually that much on a per customer basis? And then the other question, I know you just touched on it on chicken and you don\u2019t want to get into timing of new launches, but can you maybe talk about what your competitors are doing that McDonald \u2013 I guess, I would think that there\u2019s nothing that McDonald\u2019s couldn\u2019t replicate that your customers are doing. Is it a space constraint of getting new equipment? Is it getting the right flavors? Or is there something else that you\u2019re focused on in trying to improve the chicken quality.\nKevin Ozan: So I\u2019ll cover the check real quick and then Chris can talk about chicken. A couple of things on check, so roughly right now, 60% of check is mix and 40% is pricing. And that\u2019s been relatively consistent, I\u2019ll say, throughout \u2013 I think we probably said roughly two-third, but it\u2019s in that range really throughout the year for 2019. We are seeing \u2013 in general, we\u2019re seeing a little bit higher customers per ticket. If you think about the way the business is evolving between things like delivery and the kiosks, we generally now have a little bit higher number of customers per ticket. So that is a piece of it. But even knowing that, we have been able to grow guest counts in many of our international markets, so I don\u2019t want to imply that, that would say that we should be able to grow guest counts in the U.S., the dynamics are changing, but we believe we can still grow guest counts even with those change in dynamics.\nChris Kempczinski: And on your chicken question, you\u2019re right, we have a very detailed and intimate understanding of what our competitors are doing there. I think, for us, it\u2019s really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants. And so that has an operations component. Our menu, as you know, is much more broad than some of our competitors. So that\u2019s something we need to be mindful of in terms of how \u2013 what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service. And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have. What we have been out testing \u2013 we are in a test right now, as you probably know. But we\u2019re testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint, but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint. So like anything with menu in McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s a little bit of a Rubik\u2019s cube of what\u2019s the customer looking for, what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that. But I think I feel good about where we\u2019re going to net add on chicken. I think we\u2019re getting close to having something that we\u2019re excited to bring to customers.\nMike Cieplak: Thank you, Chris and Kevin and thank you everyone in joining the call today. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-22 17:30:40", "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to McDonald's Third Quarter 2019 Investors Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning we will turn the call over for your questions. I ask that you please limit yourself to one question and if you have more than one, please ask your most preference first and then re-enter the queue. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Broad based momentum across our markets resulted in a 5.9% increase in global comparable sales for the quarter and our 17th consecutive quarter of global comp sales growth. This was complemented by gains in global guest counts. Across every country function and level in our system we're seeing improving discipline and robust levels of execution that are guided by our velocity growth plan. Performance that is punctuated by culture that is embracing and leveraging innovation across every facet of our business. Every quarter, I spend several weeks visiting restaurants and speak with franchisees and market leaders around the world. I come away from these visits inspired by how our actions resonate with customers, never more so than today when our global economy presents many economic, social and political challenges and uncertainties. Across markets, our success follows a consistent formula; for the customer-first, strive to understand their needs and desires, and constantly find ways to improve their experience. Then empower our people to pull the levers that create delicious, feel-good moments for customers every visit every day. And that is start with strong corporate leadership and system alignment around the vision; engage local franchisees in bringing entrepreneurial mindset, a unique understanding of how to drive growth in their markets and skill at developing innovations that improve efficiency and the customer experience. Leverage the delicious food that is the core of our menu. Run effective value strategies rooted in deep customer insights and provide outstanding customer experience by running great restaurants. And finally, layer in initiatives to accelerate and sustain growth. Visiting markets this quarter, in St. Petersburg I saw examples of how the team is pulling velocity growth plan levers across Russia. In a tough economic environment we're meeting customers' needs for taste, quality and value. At the same time, we're empowering our crew to complement McDonald's delicious food with hospitality and convenience for our guests. Our Russian customers have taken notice we're serving more guests and delivering a better experience in our restaurants. In Portugal, we're seeing balanced growth across all day parts and all menu platforms. Year-to-date our core products are driving roughly half of comp sales growth and McDelivery is providing a meaningful comp sales lift. In Taiwan, which recently celebrated its second anniversary as a Developmental License or DL led market, the results are showing the benefit of the DL model. Our partner brings strong local leadership, a passion for our brands, greater insight at a local level and financial strength to invest in a purposeful roadmap for growth. Finally, in Japan, where an aging population, declining labor force and softening consumer confidence are combining to create unique market pressures our team has made strong gains by offering menu items that tap into local tastes, table service that resonates with guests and continued promotion of our digital capabilities, we've grown comp sales in Japan for the last four years. Across global markets, we're serving up a prudent formula that signals to our customers we care about them. In my visits with franchisees across the U.S., it's clear to me that excitements return into the system with execution of Bigger Bolder Vision 2020, the ambitious plan we build with our franchisees. Average franchisee, restaurant cash flow is moving in the right direction with 11 consecutive months of cash flow growth through September. We expect this trend to continue through the rest of 2019. During the quarter, I spent time with next generation franchisees. These are children or grandchildren of franchisees who grew up in the McDonald's system and as adults share a long term perspective on McDonald's proud heritage. In Minneapolis and Louisville, as in global markets, they are executing the velocity growth plan formula successfully. They're running great restaurants, capturing the benefit from growth initiatives and anticipating new ways to best serve our customers and crew in the future. Across the U.S., we're getting back to basics with the goal of running fast and friendly drive-thrus. We're providing tools in the kitchen to help prepare our food fast and with the highest quality standards; running national drive-thru challenges which have resulted in improving speed of service; deploying new technology like drive-thru timers, which are now installed in 60% of the U.S. system to ignite crews' competitive spirits and making bold decisions to reduce the complexity of our menu. And it's working. Thanks to these and other efforts we're seeing continued operational improvements. Customer satisfaction scores reaching all-time high in quarter three and seconds at that drive-thru have dropped by double digits year-over-year. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper dive into our performance around the world.\nKevin Ozan: We're pleased with our continued top line growth momentum. As Steve said global comp sales increased 5.9% for the quarter and each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. We also grew global guest counts. In the US, we delivered another strong quarter of sales growth. Comp sales were up 4.8% despite the increased competitive environment. While US traffic was negative for the quarter and remains our biggest opportunity, we benefited again from a healthy average check increase, driven by both product mix changes and menu pricing. Our iconic core menu continues to fuel results from the fresh beef QPC and QPC deluxe line extension to core items featured in the buy-one-get-one-for-$1 national promotion. Our customers are showing us that our investment in fresh beef is paying off as we continue to grow burger share. Additionally, our worldwide favorite's promotion that launched in quarter two and carried into quarter three resonated well, and customers especially loved the strip waffle McFlurry. The sales benefit from our modernized restaurants also contributed to our overall US comp performance for the quarter. We've converted about 1500 restaurants to EOTF this year, and remain on track to complete about 2000 projects by year end. The US now has over 9000 EOTF restaurants or roughly two thirds of the US estate. Turning outside the US, the international operated market segment once again delivered strong balanced results. Comp sales were up 5.6% with every one of the markets growing comp sales for the quarter and nearly all of the markets also growing guest counts. The UK, which delivered its 54th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth continues to gain market share across nearly all day parts despite an increasingly competitive marketplace, and declining consumer confidence. The market's performance was highlighted by a promotional food event, featuring double Quarter Pound burgers and spicy McNuggets along with growth in delivery, driving record high monthly sales and guest count volumes in the quarter. France, marked its 10th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all time high market share. The market is successfully accelerating on premium and core burgers, a continued focus on their value platform and family business and delivery expansion. Germany, also marked its 10th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. The quarter benefited from strong value messages and mobile offers along with maximizing contributions from EOTF. Looking at the international developmental license markets, which is now our largest segment by restaurant accounts, comp sales were up 8.1%. Each geographic region grew both comp sales and guest counts with Japan, China and Brazil as the largest contributors to the segment's performance. I recently visited Latin America and had the opportunity to meet with Arcos Dorados our strategic DL partner. Arcos has expanded McDonald's footprint across the region by opening new restaurants and they're also making great progress on modernizing existing restaurants to EOTF. Using local expertise and innovation, Arcos is successfully executing their strategy of delivering an enhanced customer experience, providing the most relevant menu offerings and running great restaurants, despite the geopolitical and economic challenges they face. Now I'll turn it back to Steve to further talk about the growth accelerators driving our business.\nSteve Easterbrook: As we've shared on prior calls, we're moving with purpose to bring the biggest benefit to the most people in the shortest possible time. This means taking bold actions designed to serve more customers tomorrow than today. Historically, we've achieved sustained compounding growth when we offer new customer experiences on top of a strong base of operational performance. When we launched our velocity growth plan in 2017, we committed to three such new customer experiences, which we call our growth accelerators; experience the future, digital, and delivery. That all about giving customers more control over how they order, how they pay and how they receive their food. In a short period, we've moved from deployment to real business impact with each of these accelerators. Through our EOTF deployments, we've created more inviting dining environments, easier and faster ordering, and greater hospitality with guest experience leads focused on serving our customers' needs. These efforts are clearly connecting with guests. With digital, we're working hard to fulfill customers' desire through simpler, smoother and more personal engagement over our digital platforms, including kiosks drive-thrus and our mobile app. Now here was the power of our emerging digital ecosystem on display during the third quarter than in China. The market drove strong comp sales growth, in part by delivering tangible members-only benefits to our digital community, which now stands at 100 million registered members. Additionally, we benefit from the halo effects of promoting delivery to our growing digital network. We continue to move quickly to deploy dynamic yield, which technology improves our ability to offer customers what they're likely to want, using machine learning to make suggestions based on time of day, weather and popular menu items. The business case is driving rapid adoption. Dynamic yield technology is now in over 9500 U.S. drive thrus with full rollout to nearly every US restaurant with an outdoor digital menu board expected by year-end. And we're just getting started. Deployment across our existing drive thru restaurants in Australia will be complete by year-end. And we're scoping future deployment for additional markets and applications, eventually including kiosks and our global mobile app. Ultimately, dynamic yield will facilitate a range of personalization benefits, where we can leverage knowledge of the customer, and order patterns to provide a tailored experience in restaurants, at the drive thru and on our app. Another milestone on our journey to embrace technology to provide simpler, smoother and more personal customer engagement over our digital channels is the creation of McD Tech Labs, which was fueled by our acquisition of apprentice. Our new team based in Silicon Valley brings first mover advantage and a must-with-area for our system voice technology. Apprentice talent and technology comes with the promise of more efficient and accurate ordering at the drive thru and a better experience for our customers. At the same time, we expect the technology to reduce complexity for our crew. Whether we look across the tech or consumer world we see voice technology playing an increasing role in all our lives. For McDonald's, this is particularly significant because the importance of drive-thrus to our portfolio. Delivery is another area where we've moved rapidly to capture changing consumer habits around service and convenience. Once again, customers are responding, in fact they're now placing 10 McDelivery orders per second on average globally. So whilst we're on this call, customers will likely place 36,000 McDelivery orders. For 2019, we expect delivery to drive $4 billion or roughly 4% of global system wide sales. That's up from $1 billion just three years ago. And it's now available from about 23,000 restaurants in over 80 countries. Of note our McDelivery global average check remain steady at two times the average restaurant check. Year-over-year, we continue to see double digit or higher McDelivery comp sales increases across many of our major markets. In the U.S., we saw an increase in average restaurant McDelivery orders in the restaurants where we recently introduced DoorDash as an additional delivery partner. This result is consistent with our experience in other markets. The addition of multiple delivery partners in markets such as Italy, Canada, Russia, and Spain help these markets reach new customer pools by appealing to customers primarily loyal to other apps, and expanding coverage to geographies where existing partners may not have had a presence. As we add new delivery partners globally to reach new customers, we're also keeping pace with an evolving delivery ecosystem. Delivery remains a big frontier for our business and we still have a long way to go even with our existing customers to encourage awareness and trial. This year, over 50 markets participated in our third annual celebration of McDelivery, themed McDelivery Night In doubling the number of participating markets from last year. McDelivery Night In generated a 25% plus global McDelivery sales lift that Thursday. A halo effect on the following day drove the most ever delivery orders on a single day for us. As we prioritize awareness and trial, we are encouraged by data showing that new or lapse users accounted for a significant portion of the global sales lift. We still have a lot of work ahead of us but we're moving forward with great speed, energy and excitement within McDonalds. We are confidence there's plenty of road ahead for success with McDelivery. Now, I'll turn it back over to Kevin for a deeper dive into the financials.\nKevin Ozan: In prior quarters, I've talked about the franchising we've undertaken to stabilize our business model. The capital, we're investing in EOTF alongside our franchisees to modernize our restaurants and the additional technology investments we are making to grow the business. I also discussed earlier this year that these strategic moves have created some short term financial headwinds, like lower gains on sales of restaurants, and higher depreciation and G&A expenses. As we're setting up our business for long term growth, I want to take a minute to put our strong operating results for the quarter in perspective. We grew global comp sales by nearly 6%. We grew system wide sales by 7% in constant currencies. That's well over a $1.5 billion of growth across the system. We grew constant currency revenue across each of our operating segments for the second consecutive quarter. Our franchise margin dollars were $2.5 billion growing $150 million for the quarter or 6% increase in constant currencies. We achieved an operating margin of 44% and EPS for the quarter was $2.11, with growth in margins being offset by lower gains on restaurant sales and a higher tax rate. This performance reflects the strength and stability of our business model, as well as the ongoing actions we're taking to position our business for sustained long term profitable growth. In addition, consolidated company operating margins increased 20 basis points to 18.6% for the quarter. US company operating margins increased 280 basis points to 15.6%, benefiting from comp sales growth and improved operational performance. IOM company operating margins declined 60 basis points, but we're still a healthy 21.3% as continued labor and commodity pressures more than offset comp sales growth. In the US, third quarter pricing was up nearly 3% while commodity costs increased about 2%, primarily due to higher beef costs, we still expect the full year US grocery basket to be up about 2% to 3%. Turning to G&A. Steve mentioned earlier that we're committed to investing in our business for the long term. As we become more efficient with our day-to-day G&A to run the business, we're choosing to invest in technology and R&D, such as our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield, Apprente. The creation of McD Tech Labs, and an increased focus on back of the house efficiencies for our restaurants. Our year-to-date G&A spend is up 1% in constant currencies, and given our strategic investments, we expect full year G&A to be up about 1% to 2%. Our effective tax rate was 25.3% for the quarter, and we expect our full year tax rate to be relatively similar. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our third quarter results by $0.03 per share, given the continued strength of the US dollar. Based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact Q4 earnings by $0.01 to $0.03, which would result in a full year headwind of $0.20 to $0.22 cents. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year. And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved an 8% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5 annually. This marked the company's 43rd consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders and reinforces our confidence in the company's long term strategy. Through third quarter, we returned a cumulative $22.5 billion against our three year cash returns shareholders target of about $25 billion, which will be completed this year.\nSteve Easterbrook: As we talk about change and embed a culture of innovation and how we work is important to connect these efforts to our iconic global brand. For over 60 years, the strength of the McDonald's brand has been our ability to offer a compelling menu of delicious and affordable food made with high quality ingredients, and complementing that with hospitality and convenience for our guests. An integral component of that brand magic is meeting consumers on their terms, in places where they congregate, whether it would be in small towns or urban centers, on the sidelines of work or play or on the various other places where communities come together. A brand on its essence is a promise and our promise has largely remained unchanged over the years. What has changed are the ways in which we fulfill that promise. The world is different than it was in 1955. Different today, even it was four years ago, when we launched our turnaround. We're keenly aware that we have to be out ahead of these changes, investing, executing and growing with a deep sense of urgency and purpose. Our strong performance in the third quarter and over the past 17 quarters didn't happen in a vacuum, is the result of our people firmly committed to our velocity growth plan, and the culture of innovation that is driving that plan. That culture of innovation is rooted in a relentless focus on the customer experience, making the jobs of our restaurant employees simpler and more rewarding, and building an operational foundation for long-term growth and competitive success. Operational and marketing innovations have been embedded into our DNA since the opening of store number one Des Plaines, Illinois. Each time we innovate collectively with our franchisees and supply chain partners, whether by founding Hamburger University in 1961, introducing the Big Mac in 1968, opening the first drive-thru in 1975, introducing extra value meals in 1991, launching all day breakfast in 2015 or accelerating delivery in 2017, we plant seeds that result in sustained growth for our business. Indeed, it is through this approach that we've been able to grow guest counts, strengthen our three legged stool of employees, suppliers and franchisees and build an enduring brand for the legacy of sustainable growth. This is not to say our company and our industry going to face challenges ahead. We have before and we will again. But by having the right people in the right places, supporting them with resources and investments they need and embedding a culture of innovation to how we work, we know we can deliver on our brand promise in any environment and sustain the growth trajectory, which has defined this business for over half a century. With that said, let's begin our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nMikeCieplak: Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEricGonzalez: Hey, thanks for taking the question. You have a large hamburger competitor announcing its intention to enter the breakfast day part with the big ad campaign and promising to drive a 10% sales mix almost immediately. I was just wondering, if you can comment or discuss your thoughts on how that might impact the industry in 2020? And if you see the industry shifting, again towards heavy discounting in the morning? And I recognize you might not want to give too much away, but if you could comment on how you see this playing out among your competitors, as they try to protect its share, it will be really helpful? Thanks.\nSteveEasterbrook: Thanks, Eric. Steve, here. By the way, apologies to everyone if I'm coughing a little bit through this call, I'm just a bit under the weather at the moment. But yes, so breakfast is a competitive day part, I mean, we've seen competitors ramp up their activity during this year as well actually. So having another entrant in next year will just ensure that market share fight remains as competitive as ever. I'm not sure if it's really going to be anyone's huge best interest to have it too much value or discount led. But it is an important day part for us to protect and grow. I think for us, we are encouraged this current quarter, because breakfast has been a little behind the rest of the day's performance until this quarter, and we've seen our breakfast sales growth, pretty much in line with the sort of sales growth we are seeing across the rest of the day. So I think that gives us encouragement that the actions that many of our local coops are taking to fight this on a local level and beginning to get some traction. So -- but we operate in a competitive market, whether it's breakfast or all rest of day. So we\u2019re used to fighting for our share and we'll carry on doing that for next year for sure.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrewCharles: Great. Thank you. Kevin, you talked about year-to-date SG&A growth of roughly 1% with 4Q implied obviously step up to make the full year guidance of 1% to 2%. And I guess just given the accelerating exit rate of G&A in 2019 and the creation of McD Tech Labs to evaluate future technological opportunities. How should we think about what this means for 2020 G&A with street broadly has you pegged at flat G&A dollars?\nKevinOzan: Yes, thanks, Andrew. So as I mentioned, our full year spend is expected to be up 1% to 2%, we're up basically 1% through year-to-date. So obviously, you can do the math for fourth quarter. But, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are more efficient on our day-to-day G&A, we're choosing to invest in certain areas of technology and R&D, Dynamic Yield, Apprente, McD Tech Labs, and back in the house some efficiencies that are increasing the G&A certainly slightly this year. And my expectation is that the G&A would be higher in 2020 than is in 2019, mainly because as you know, our acquisitions of both the Apprente and Dynamic Yield happened midyear this year. So we'll have kind of full year impact of those in 2020. I'd say we believe these investments are really important to help set us up well for long term growth. And so we believe that the right thing to do, as you know over the last several years, we've lowered our G&A, both in absolute dollars as well as significantly as a percent of sales. As a perspective in 2014 G&A was 2.8% of sales, this year will be about 2.2% of sales. And really what we're focused on is driving growth and operating margin. And our belief is that we're going to have to spend some money in order to be able to drive operating margin that certainly has grown significantly, again from about 29% to 30% back in 2014 to mid-40s now. So you should expect the G&A will be a little higher in 2020 than is in '19. But to us, it's really about driving top line and bottom line growth.\nSteveEasterbrook: Just to hook on that as well. I think if we take Dynamic Yield as an example, clearly, we've absorbed the incremental G&A that comes with the acquisition. I think part of how we challenge ourselves here is to generate the return on that investment as fast as you can. And I think we've been encouraged by the fact we have the Dynamic Yield technology now in 9500 drive-thrus in the US. And we're pretty much rolled out across the entire Australian system as well now. And with other of our larger international markets lining up. So we think it's -- we challenge ourselves in terms of being physically responsible, but growth is kind of the primary driver of all of our ambition. And I think these investments are enabling that for sure.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from Katie Fogertey with Goldman Sachs.\nKatieFogertey: Great, thank you. You guys started to test out the beyond plant based burger in Canada. I'm wondering, as you saw the quarter unfold did you guys think that not having a meatless burger was a headwind to your sales? How are you thinking about that opportunity here? Thanks.\nSteveEasterbrook: We're interested in this clearly. We've taken the plant based product to Ontario, Canada. We've got 28 restaurants now. We only launched it with a couple of days of the quarter to go. So very early days. Clearly, there's been competitive activity, which you will all be aware of, which I'm sure has helped create some more immediate interest or some shorter term, certainly response, consumer response. I guess what we're interested in is really how best to position this, get a sense of the, as they call it them the Flexitarian customer really what is their appetite for this, no pun intended, but would it drive incremental visits, is it option just to switch out from time to time. We want to get the taste right. We want to get the marketing right. We want get the operations right. So there's a number of important factors that we're learning quickly. And we think Ontario's a great spot because it will give us a good read across North America frankly, but also into the developed markets in Europe as well. So we think the read across will be beneficial and help us speed up our intelligence on this. So more to come clearly. But it's an area of interest for sure.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSaraSenatore: Hi. Question about technology spend. And then just a quick clarification on what Kevin just said. First, I guess you're spending a lot of money on technology as you pointed out. And certainly makes sense to leverage scale to make these investments. But our sense is that a lot of your competitors, at least in the U.S. are doing, are also doing well perhaps without as much of an investment and to your point about traffic. So a little bit of a headwind for you. So I guess, how do we have confidence that, the amount that you're spending or the magnitude is the right amount that it isn't perhaps too much or that there is an ROI on this over time. And then just a clarification wise, Kevin, you mentioned you want to see growing margin rate. So it sounded like you - or growing margin, it sounded like you were talking about rate as opposed to margin dollars. So should we expect margin rate to continue to expand from here? Thanks.\nKevinOzan: Yes. Let me start with the last one first, take care of that one, and then I will come back to the tech spend. When I talk about operating margin, I was talking about kind of the mid 40% range. But certainly you should expect that operating margin dollars will grow. Just as a perspective, if I think about kind of our restaurant margin dollars through year to date, through September, we've grown restaurant margin dollars, about $450 million in constant currency. So you should expect that our ambition is to continue to grow those margin dollars as we continue on. And our expectation is to continue growing those margin dollars. Some offset to that will be G&A, obviously. And as I mentioned, we think G&A will go up some in 2020, but certainly not anywhere close to offset growth and margin dollars, which should mean that our expectation is that operating margin dollars would continue to grow. Relating to tech spend, I'll say a couple things. And then if Steve wants to chime in, he's certainly welcome. It's an interesting question, but I don't know how to prove to you or convince you, let's say that we're spending exactly the right amount. I'd say a couple of things. One, I think we have certainly proven internally and hopefully externally, that we have put discipline around our G&A processes, and that we are investing in things that are driving growth for the business. As Steve mentioned, the way we look at our spend is to determine what kind of return we expect to get on that spend. And that helps drive a determination of what we will spend. We were, as you know, certainly a couple of years ago, a little behind on our technology spending so that we did have to spend some in the last couple years. I'll say just to get infrastructure and things set up the right way. And then finally, I'd say our intent is to set ourselves up for sustainable long term growth. And that's why we're investing in technology today. Our belief is those who aren't investing in technology, at some point will be behind and will need to catch up. And we'd rather be a little bit ahead of the curve and spend the right amount that we think will drive future growth.\nSteveEasterbrook: And I just pull that I think the part of the performance that we're showing, say through 2019, is a result of some of the technology spend that we've invested the last two to three years. And if I was a backtrack, say four or five years, the majority of our tech spend was backup house type spent just to keep the restaurants operating. That we've really got much more consumer facing. So that's kind of a new era to spend for us. But we begin to see the results that we want. As we see the cell phone or kiosk usage increase around the world, we see the average check growth that comes with it. As we invest in the outdoor digital menu boards, and then you can plug in, dynamic yield capabilities, we start to see, again, average check growth come from there. Or even just as simple as getting our infrastructure setup to enable us to meet home delivery, for example. And now integrating those apps into our global mobile app. This all takes investment, but it either makes you see the driving visits or driving check, but it's also driving some efficiencies. But it's not always about acquisitions either. So obviously, we've made a couple of acquisitions this year, which clearly gives us an incremental G&A, which we just spoke about. But again this is also just ongoing investment, through our innovation center around modernizing the equipment stack, if you like and getting that kind of ecosystem functioning more effectively to help our management crew run the restaurants better. So I would say some of the proof points are out there already. But we're excited about continuing to drive efficiencies through technology and also grow through technology. So more to come.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavidPalmer: Thanks. Good morning. Question on earnings. Obviously 2019 is not going to be a year of earnings per share growth, but there's been significant drags in there, lease accounting tax rate, G&A step ups, currency, maybe seven plus points of drag and all those things to all together. You mentioned G&A being somewhat higher for 2020. But just thinking about what you should do in 2020, in terms of earnings versus that high single digit algorithm? What are some gives and takes aside from G&A that we should be thinking about? And then on free cash flow, is your CapEx outlook still the same with your CapEx dropping from about $2.3 billion in '19 to about half that by 2023? Thank you.\nKevinOzan: Thanks, David. Okay, let me try and going through all of that. So, regarding 2020, I guess let me first say this, we still have strong belief in our long-term algorithm and target. So I'll start with that. Regarding 2020, if I think about this year just to put this year in perspective that obviously leads into 2020. Year-to-date again September right now, we've put up a 5.9% Global comp, 5% in the US, 7% system wide sales growth in constant currencies. And as I mentioned to Sara's question, that has resulted in about $450 million of restaurant margin growth in constant currencies year-to-date. We do have higher G&A this year because of the dynamic yield apprentice. We will have higher G&A next year because of those as well as just the amortization of some of the tech investments we\u2019ve made. As I think about the gives and takes, the other couple things will be this year we\u2019ll have nearly $200 million lower of restaurant gains. We will likely have some lower gains even next year, certainly not to the extent of this year. We will have continued incremental EOTF depreciation, again, not to the level of this year's increase, which was roughly or a little bit over a $100 million dollars on franchise margins. We don't expect the incremental to be as much in 2020, but we will still have some incremental depreciation on those. So that's some of the pieces. What I would say is, we feel good about -- well, let me go to CapEx first, I guess. CapEx as you mentioned, it'll be roughly $2.3 billion this year, roughly similar amount next year, and then it should fall bit below $2 billion after that. So that regardless of that we believe that free cash flow will continue to grow year upon year. That's how our model shows it right now. And I'd say based on our algorithm, and the way we've looked at it. I feel good about the business model. I feel good about our ability to grow margins and drop back to the bottom line. I certainly feel good about our strategy. And I feel good about the investments we're making in technology and R&D that we think will help set us up well for long-term growth.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohnGlass: Thanks very much. If I can just come back to maybe the current quarter in the US and the comps which is 4.8, were strong, but they weren't as strong as the prior quarter at least and you've got building EOTF momentum. You talked about dynamic yield, you talked about expanding your aggregator networks, so all those would point to better results. And they were slightly softer, at least sequentially. So what were the offsets? Where are you seeing, how did traffic fare relative to last quarter? I think you were sort of optimistic traffic was a little better last quarter, but maybe it wasn't sustainable. So was it being just a relapse then to normalization? A little more color on what changed in the business third quarter in the U.S. versus the prior quarter?\nKevinOzan: Yes. I'll start and then I will let Steve chime in just so he can save his voice a little bit. Traffic for the third quarter, I'll say there wasn't a meaningful change in traffic trends in the third quarter for the U.S. versus the first couple quarters. So it's still negative. As I mentioned, it's still our largest opportunity, but not a meaningful change in trend in the third quarter versus second quarter. You will recall as we mentioned on our second quarter call, we had a couple benefits in second quarter, one related to the timing of Easter holiday, one relating to some promotional activity we had related to Filet O Fish that helped second quarter I'll say be a little bit above trend, if you will. So third quarter -- if you think about two years stacks, third quarter is relatively similar to first quarter. And the other thing I'd say related to within the quarter, because I know there's been some chatter out there about how the quarter got weaker for us as the quarter went on. All three months were relatively similar in terms of comp sales. So each month was between a 4.5 and 5.5 comp. So it's not like -- it's not like the worlds fell off in August or September or anything like that. And the other thing I would say is, there is certainly was some competitive pressure mid-August, probably through mid-September. That seemed to lessen as we ended the quarter. So I think all of those factors kind of impacted our net result in the order. As you mentioned, EOTF, is a benefit -- third quarter benefit was relatively similar to second quarter benefit. And I would expect that to be similar in the fourth quarter before it starts leveling off for next year.\nSteveEasterbrook: I think the only thing I would add is if we kind of drill into our detail of points ones here and points one there. Some of the work we've done on simplifying our menu as I mean we've had a little bit of resistance when we move away from say signature crafted. Now the flip side is helping us run better restaurants and we saw our drive-thru service times in the U.S. improved by around 20 seconds across the quarter year-on-year. So I think we're still making the right decisions for the long term. But Yes, there's going to be a little bit of short term resistance when you simplify the menu. So little bits and pieces but no fundamental shift in momentum. I mean, it really was balanced sales growth across day parts and across the menu, actually, which I think is what's giving us confidence. And some of the accelerator initiatives that we've launched are delivering consistently the sorts of performance that we've shared with you in the past.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohnIvankoe: Hi, thank you. Actually a follow up on that as well. You obviously mentioned improving drive-thru times, which is obviously important in record guest satisfaction scores. I mean, these are things that would normally have driven a positive traffic comp, for McDonald's, maybe in the past. The comments that you made on franchisee store level cash flow. 11 months, I think, a positive year-on-year cash flow. How much of that was due to some of the changes that you made, from a promotional perspective. And, what's the post mortem on giving more of the value back to some of the local partners? Are you in the place where you think you're optimizing profitability and traffic? Or might there be kind of a shift in balance, if you will in 2020 where we might see more value in words to drive traffic maybe into some extent, at the sake of profitability?\nSteveEasterbrook: Yes John, it's. Actually it is that delicate balance, so I mean, to get the consistent top-line growth, and having profitable growth for our enterprise is clearly critical. We want that drives their motivation and drive their confidence, it drives their ability and willingness to keep reinvesting in the initiatives as we've identified. But we don't want to give up customers. And it's fair to say that the guest count declines we do see. There's a couple of things I'll share with you. One is the lower average check level. So clearly there is a value component in there and it's just a case of how do we address that? Is that more of a local level? Is it a national level? I don\u2019t know, our U.S. team's working through that. Another way we've cut and diced this is across the US we have 56 co-ops. And if we look at the fourth quarter the most challenged performing co-ops. See clearly 25% of our cost but actually more than more than half of our guests count declines explained in those 14. So we're putting more support and activity into those co-ops to see if we can just pull up that tail which says multi will lift us collectively as well and we're beginning to see traction there as well. So there's a number of different ways we're approaching this, but we want to remain competitive on value clearly. Getting back to the drive-thru service times, we will see incremental visits as we continue to improve service. Fundamentally we are a quick service restaurant and all trends had been heading the wrong way for too many years. And I'm delighted at how much traction we're getting there given the focus you put on it this year. And we know customers will notice 20 seconds, particularly the time press customers, those busy peak hours well, that's the breakfast rush or lunchtime. Those savings that they don't necessarily notice it on just one visit. But as we consistently run better restaurants, we believe that will be a strong competitive position going forward.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavidTarantino: Hi, good morning. And just a question on the technology investments you made in specifically dynamic yield. I guess what I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing so far as you roll it out and in terms of the customer response or the business impact? And how you see that evolving as I guess customers get more accustomed to using the technology?\nSteveEasterbrook: At the moment we've effectively rolled out from core capability of dynamic users. Kind of what we would say suggest itself. The beauty of this is there is nothing that customer has to adjust to, they almost don't know that this experience is happening for them as we've got dynamic digital menu boards. And effectively as they start to place their order, the menu boards respond to that to that ordering process and therefore are more likely to suggest items a customer will want and less likely to show items that customers are less likely to want. And of course, machine learning helps you improve that and particularly given the transaction levels we have across our business we can learn pretty really -- very quickly. But there's further capabilities as we're learning so for example, there's an area now where they can offer trending now which will actually pick up items either in a restaurant or a local group of restaurants that are proven to be particularly popular at that point in time. So there's kind of get another level of dynamic interaction going there. And again, at this point, we're only really talking about having it on the outdoor digital menu boards. But suffice to say the team -- part of the investment we're making in the business with talent and expertise is to look how can we integrate that into the cell phone or kiosk and perhaps ultimately the global mobile app as well. So I think we're at early stages already very encouraged about the results we're seeing. The speed with which we can execute and roll this out, deploy this is really giving us a lot of confidence that we can get this across. I guess we've now got an outdoor digital menu boards in over 10,000 restaurants in the US. And the majority of our full length international lead markets are pretty much fully deployed as well. UK has got a little bit of cash enough to do. But as I say, this is encouraging operators to invest in the technology because they're seeing the return. And as I say, this is just for the core basic capability and there's more we can add to it.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMattDiFrisco: Thank you. I just had a couple of follow up questions. I guess, can you just comment on how that 3% price should look, going forward, is something that is going to be held in? And then I think in previous quarters, you described how much that was contributing to the check. And 2Q was about third of the check or so. If you could just sort of draw that line for us? And then a clarification. I think you mentioned on the prepared remarks, hamburger share was gained or you gained hamburger share, but your traffic was negative. Does that imply then there was some near term increased competitive pressure around chicken and you lost a little bit of business and on the chicken side in the near term in the US?\nSteveEasterbrook: Okay, I'll start. Price, Matt, let me start with how we think about it. I think we've talked before, but we look at various things. Certainly food-away-from-home is one guidepost. But also, we look at, and the pricing we talk about is pricing system wide which as you know 95% of those restaurants are run by franchisees determining that -- determining that pricing. But certainly I think if they consider their pricing, they're also looking at cost pressures, whether that's labor, commodities, et cetera. And it's really about trying to strategically balance, offsetting some of those cost pressures with kind of what a customer is willing to pay. So, there isn't a pure formula, that 3% that -- and I think we said nearly 3%, actually it is a little bit below 3%, but close to 3%. And they impact at our comp is actually a little bit less than that, because while the pure price -- what I quoted are pure price increase, but you hit a little bit resistance. And so the actual contribution of the comp ends up being a little bit below that. But it still is roughly that third, two-thirds, about a third, from price, roughly two-thirds from product mix for various reasons, including dynamic yield, the kiosk usage and delivery, all the things that we've been talking about. So that's the -- that's the story on pricing. Related to the burger share, so as we said that in the U.S., we did gain hamburger share in the quarter. I think it's fair to assume with everything going on in the quarter with chicken that we did go a little bit the opposite way on chicken. So I think that's a fair conclusion. So that, if we look at the top 11 markets, we actually gained IO share and QSR share in all 10 of the largest markets beyond the U.S. as well, including some extremely strong gains in markets like the UK, Russia, Australia, France as of all time market share high for example. So I think we are we have proven to be competitive and driving the broader market dynamic around the world actually, which is helping underpin the sales momentum and business momentum.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChrisO'Cull: Yes, thanks. Steve, there's been a lot of discussion about how dynamic yield tech support suggestive selling. But I would think the new digital menu boards would also allow the company to do a better job of price optimization meaning, stores could be able to adjust prices more frequently. Can you describe how the new menu boards or digital boards will change kind of the company's approach to pricing?\nSteveEasterbrook: Yes, we typically try to avoid that. And partly just because I think it's part of the brand promise we have the customers is just that reliability in knowing what their typical meal or combination costs. So it has been discussed sometimes through and I know others out there. And that's kind of, if you like ultimate dynamic pricing capability. But that's not really kind of underpinning the business the way we want to do business and to stay away from that. We try and have a careful thoughtful approach with our kind of pricing consultants if you like. And we just make periodic adjustments and just give customers that that kind of assurance and reliability.\nMikeCieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrianBittner: Thanks. Good morning. First, just a clarification on David Palmer's question on 2020. Kevin, should we be interpreting your answer in a way that we should be modeling 2020 as a below algorithm year for earnings or no? And just on the store level margins in the U.S. a meaningful trend change in the margins there up 280 bps this quarter. Can you just dive a little deeper on what specifically changed in the margin dynamics this quarter for the U.S. versus last several quarters and should we expect it to continue? Thanks.\nKevinOzan: Yes. Let me talk about the U.S. margins first. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned kind of what I called operational performance improvements. And really what that means, as I'm exciting as this may be is kind of the basics of running better restaurants. We keep talking about just running better restaurants and getting more efficient in running restaurants. But it's things like reducing complexity in the restaurant, simplifying procedures, focusing on efficiencies and the derive thru, being more diligent with our labor, scheduling and staffing, basic food control. So it's all that stuff that we talk about when it's just managing a restaurant really well. And I think putting more of a focus on that has helped our company operated folks focus on that. To be fair, I think the other piece, I would just throw in there a little bit. Is there is less disruption going on this year than there was last year from a couple standpoint -- couple pieces. One we're almost completed with EOTF in the company operated restaurants. So by the end of this year we will have all of the EOTF projects in our company operated restaurant completed. That's one thing that does, is a distraction and disruptions to the restaurant. The other thing as you know is we have been re-franchising over the last several years and that becomes a little bit of a disruption certainly to the company operated business. So the fact that that's more stable and we have kind of settled in where we are now, I think helps just the stability of running the restaurants on the company operated site. So all of those things I think go into play into why you certainly saw some of that improvement this year. I think as we look forward in the near term in the U.S., we still do have some pressures like the EOTF depreciation, some labor costs. But I think kind of similar range that we've been in the 15% to 16%ish range in the US is probably a reasonable way to think about it going forward. Regarding 2020 in the fourth quarter we will give more detail and go through our actual outlook that will provide more detailed guidance. I'll leave what I said for now as general guidance and it certainly we will get into more detail as we get to year end. We\u2019re in the midst of going through our detailed planning right as we speak. And so I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead before we actually complete that process.\nMike Cieplak: That completes our call this morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. Have a good day.\nOperator: This does conclude the McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-07-26 18:59:09", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Second Quarter 2019 Investors Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: Good morning. We're pleased to be speaking to you today from our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago, where we recently celebrated our one year anniversary in this contemporary urban facility. Returning to Chicago was a deliberate move to get closer to our customers and the trend shaping business and society today. Our new facility was designed to be a modern and inspiring environment, a catalyst for our evolving culture. Our move is also a metaphor for the momentum we're seeing across our business. Momentum has been building since we first launched our turnaround plan. As we've recently passed the four-year mark, I thought, it would be important to spend a few minutes reflecting on our journey. Back in May 2015, I announced our initial steps to reset and rebuild our business, including our three-fold priorities of driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brands, and unlocking financial value. At the time, we were keenly aware that the pace of change inside McDonald's is being eclipsed by the pace of change outside our business. We knew, we had to evolve with our changing market and consumer dynamics, and we knew incremental progress wasn't going to cut it. Returning to a growth company was going to require big, bold steps and greater personal accountability. We knew success would be determined by the fast beating the slow, by choosing progress over perfection, and moving with a sense of urgency. So, we set out on the journey to become faster, smarter and more responsive to changing consumer expectations. We restructured to be closer to customers and faster at the point of impact. We refranchised to drive growth and bring greater insights at a local level. We increased accountability and financial discipline and returned cash to shareholders. Most importantly, we returned to operating growth. Indeed, within two years, we established a strong foundation, one that was fit for purpose, and brought the business to a place where we could begin accelerating growth again. That led to the launch of our Velocity Growth Plan in March of 2017. The plan is rooted in building on the fundamentals that have served our Company so well for over 60 years. It's about running better restaurants, offering a compelling menu of delicious and affordable food, and complementing that with hospitality and convenience for our guests. We know that when we create delicious, feel good moments for customers, every visit every day, customers recognize our efforts and reward us with repeat visits. We also know that we must continuously complement that work with big and powerful moves that keep us relevant and inviting for new generations of guests. We deployed three accelerators to help us do just that, our Experience of the Future or EOTF; digital and delivery. With these efforts, we have focused on actions that have the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time. That's the path to becoming a better McDonald's. Four years in, we did the hard work to put the Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators firmly in place, and we are energized by the broad-based strength in our results. For the quarter, global comparable sales increased 6.5%, which marks four full years of quarterly comp sales growth. This was complemented by positive global comp guest counts. During the quarter, we made strong gains in running great restaurants. We still have work to do, because speed of service is so important to our customers, seconds matter and impact decisions they make on repeat visits. We're leveraging the power of the system, franchisees, suppliers and employees to reduce menu complexity, improve operational procedures, deploy new drive-thru crew competitions and incentives, adopt best practices for staffing, and leverage new technologies to make it easier for our teams to take responsibility for performance. And we're encouraged by the results we're seeing. We set market level targets early this year and have dropped service times across many markets globally. They're providing a better experience for our customers, and with that seeing record high customer satisfaction scores this summer. Here in the U.S., the plan we built with our franchisees is ambitious. Collectively, we recognized the need for change, and knew it\u2019d be hard work. We spent 2018, deploying major initiatives, including a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization, and the restructuring of U.S. field operations. At the beginning of this year, we said 2019 would be a year to execute on running better restaurants and optimize the initiatives we deployed last year. In restaurant visits with franchisees around the country, I'm seeing the results of focused execution against the plan. Importantly, average franchisee restaurant cash flow has grown eight consecutive months through June, fully overcoming the decline we saw in 2018. Across our International Operated Markets or IOM, we\u2019re seeing continued success. Consistent execution against the Velocity Growth Plan is a winning formula. I had the pleasure to visit Italy during the quarter and witnessed firsthand a rigorous focus on operational innovations and improvements. Italy now has posted 10 consecutive quarters of comp sales and guest count growth with double-digit comp sales and guest count growth for the quarter. In fact, Italy has outperformed the local Informal Eating Out or IEO category for nearly two years now. I saw similar energy and focus when I went from Italy to Poland, which also posted strong comp sales and guest count growth for the quarter. This high-performing market was an early adopter of EOTF and digital. In Warsaw, I saw the positive impact our guest experience leaders have on hospitality, as they greeted customers with a special warmth that made guests feel welcome. Italy and Poland are great examples of markets where we start a best practice and replicate it at scale across other markets. Whether around EOTF rollout, hospitality, operations, or digital, ideas originate in one market and rapidly move to another, creating an environment where all boats rise. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper dive into our comp sales trends by market and performance drivers.\nKevin Ozan: Our top-line momentum remains strong. As Steve mentioned, global comp sales increased 6.5% for the quarter with each operating segment contributing meaningfully to our growth. In the U.S., comp sales were up 5.7%, our highest comp sales increase since the launch of all day breakfast back in the fourth quarter of 2015. And once again, we also grew comp sales across all dayparts. Performance drivers for the quarter included proven value and deals such as our national 2 for $5 Mix & Match promotion, featuring our core menu items, as well as other locally relevant offers. Our renewed focus on our iconic core menu, resonates well with our customers. Since switching the fresh beef for our Quarter Pound burgers just over a year ago, our sales results and positive customer response confirm it was the right strategic move. In the first half of 2019, we sold over 55 million more Quarter Pound burgers compared to last year. A combination of both deal offers and line extensions, featuring bacon and DeLuxe builds on our classic Quarter Pounder with cheese helped to boost sales. Similar to last quarter, the sales benefit from our modernized EOTF restaurants contributed to our overall U.S. comp performance, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2019. By taking learnings from completed projects, we've successfully reduced construction downtime, and we're also recovering sales quicker, after reopening. During the quarter, we converted an additional 600 restaurants to EOTF for a total of 1,000 projects completed in the first half of this year. We still expect to complete a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. Strong average check growth from both product mix and pricing continues to fuel our top-line in the U.S. We're seeing success with offerings that increase average check, traffic and cash flow, such as our current worldwide favorites, LTO. However, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains a top priority in the street fight for market share. Turning outside the U.S. Strong balanced results continued across the International Operated segment with comp sales up 6.6% for the quarter. Each of the markets within the segment grew comp sales, and nearly all of the markets also grew comp guest counts. Strong results in the UK, France and Germany were key contributors to the segment\u2019s growth. The UK marked its 53rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and increased market share versus our competition across all dayparts. Maximizing delivery was a key success factor for the market, along with menu innovation, such as the bacon roll breakfast sandwich and the Taste of America burgers LTO. France has been successful with both its premium and core burger offerings, balanced with a compelling value platform, helping the market to again achieve record high market share. France now has nine consecutive quarters of both comp sales and guest count growth. And Germany is maximizing contributions from EOTF, our core menu and strong value messages, all of which resonate with their customers. Germany also gained market share versus competitors, and customer satisfaction scores are up. In the International Developmental Licensed segment, comp sales increased 7.9% with sales and guest count growth across each geographic region within the segment. Results across our three largest markets drove the strong sales performance with double-digit growth in Brazil, strong comps in Japan and positive performance in China. Accelerated new restaurant growth by our strategic partners, primarily in China, led the segment to grow system-wide sales by 10% for the quarter in constant currencies. Now, I'll turn it back to Steve to further discuss the growth accelerators driving our global business.\nSteve Easterbrook: Over the past four years, we've seen unprecedented changes in the global consumer landscape. With this proliferation of change, consumers today expect more from us. Quality, service and convenience are more important than ever. And of course, delicious food served by welcoming people is absolutely essential. Accelerators of our Velocity Growth Plan are all about giving our global customers more control over how they order, how they pay, and how they serve their food. In the U.S., we've made significant progress in modernizing our restaurants through our Experience of the Future initiative. We have now modernized over 8,500 U.S. restaurants. Today, customers are much more like to visit EOTF restaurants than they were just a year ago. At the end of May, I was honored to join our team in New York for the opening of our new Time Square restaurant. Our three-storey restaurant is a major brand statement on how we're providing a better customer experience through d\u00e9cor, enhanced customer service and seamless order and pay technologies. Our major IOM markets have had Experience of the Future for some time and we\u2019re continuing to unlock this potential. For example, in Australia and our major European markets, over 40% of in-store customers now use kiosks when dining with us, taking control of how they order, customize their food and select how to be served. From New York to Sydney and most places in between, our restaurants are not just ready for the future, they are meeting customers on their terms today. Delivery is another area where we're taking bold action to meet customers\u2019 expectations for high quality food on their terms with increasing demands for convenience and speed. We've made significant progress on delivery the past two years and have room to grow in a largely untapped market with great upside. Driving customer awareness and trial about the McDelivery remains a top priority. Globally, we expect delivery to be a $4 billion business in 2019 for McDonald's and franchise restaurants. Across our major markets, we've maintained double-digit delivery sales growth in restaurants offering the service for more than 12 months. In the UK and Spain, delivery now accounts for greater than 10% of sales in restaurants that offer delivery. In the U.S. McDelivery with Uber Eats is now available in more than 9,000 restaurants, which is more than half of all McDonald's U.S. restaurants. They're also continuing to add new partners that allow us to scale and deploy delivery to meet untapped customer demand. We recently announced a partnership in the U.S. with DoorDash to expand the availability and accessibility for customers to receive our delicious food wherever they are. We will quickly scale with DoorDash across the U.S. to provide customers with a choice of delivery partners. In Canada, we've seen incremental strength in delivery with our second national partner, SkipTheDishes. We offer delivery in 850 restaurants in Canada, many of which offer delivery from both partners. Multiple delivery partners now are also the norm in Italy, Spain and Russia, where we're learning from our partners whilst driving increased delivery orders. We're also taking bold action on digital. Since closing the Dynamic Yield acquisition in April, we launched the decision logic technology on digital menu boards in drive-thrus across multiple regions in the U.S. Customers have responded to the point-of-sale suggestive selling by adding french fries, drinks, Chicken McNuggets and other favorites to their orders. We're already seeing an increase in average check by improving our ability to offer customers what they are likely to want with suggestions based on time of day, weather, and items already in customers\u2019 orders. We introduced Dynamic Yield technology in Australia this month, and we'll increase the number of drive-thrus in the U.S., using the technology from about 700 today to over 8,000 in the next two weeks. By year-end, we plan to integrate the technology in nearly 100% of our drive-thrus in both markets. This is another example of using technology to create more engaging experiences for our guests. The technology infrastructure we\u2019ve built over the past three years to support our Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators is fundamental to our transformation. It's a reflection of what our customers demand from us, and it's not static. Digital capabilities change by the day and impact what customers ultimately expect from us. The technological ecosystem we're building will enable us to meet these rising expectations, positioning us for new opportunities to elevate and transform the customer experience. Now, I'll turn it back over to Kevin for a look into the financial results for the quarter.\nKevin Ozan: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 grew 7% in constant currencies for the quarter when excluding impairment and other strategic charges from both the current and prior years. Our results have benefited from strong operating performance for the quarter. Revenue grew 3% in constant currencies as our comp sales growth more than offset the impact of refranchising activity. Adjusted operating margin for the first half of the year was 43.2%, an increase of 30 basis points versus last year. As a result of our franchising efforts over the past few years, the largest component of operating income is our franchise margin dollars. With growth of 9% in constant currencies for the quarter, franchise margin dollars now represent nearly 85% of total restaurant margin dollars. Our consolidated franchise margin percent declined 100 basis points as our strong sales performance was impacted by higher EOTF related depreciation in the U.S., as well as 70 basis points from the lease accounting presentation change that I discussed last quarter. As a reminder, this presentation change has no effect on our franchise margin dollars, but the impact to our franchise margin percent will be ongoing. Turning to our company-operated restaurants. Consolidated margins grew 20 basis points to 18.1% for the quarter. IOM segment company-operated margins were flat versus prior year, as our strong sales performance was offset primarily by higher labor and other costs, such as delivery commissions. U.S. company-operated margins grew 40 basis points to 16.3%, reflecting strong sales performance and refranchising, partially offset by continued commodity and labor pressures, along with higher EOTF-related depreciation. Second quarter pricing for both the U.S. and the big five markets in the IOM segment, was up about 2.5%, while commodity costs were up a similar amount across these markets. In the U.S., we expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat in the back half of the year and still expect our grocery basket to be up 2% to 3% for the full year. For the big five markets in the IOM segment, we expect a full year commodity cost increase to be up roughly 2.5%. G&A was 2.1% of system-wide sales for the quarter and flat to prior year in constant currencies. We still expect G&A for the full year to remain relatively flat in constant currencies versus last year, as we continue to invest in digital and technology capabilities. Our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, and we continue to expect a full year tax rate between 24% and 26%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our second quarter results by $0.07 per share, given the strength of the U.S. dollar. At current exchange rates, we expect the foreign currency impact to lessen to $0.02 to $0.04 for Q3 with further easing into Q4. Our estimated full year headwind remains at $0.18 to $0.20. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year. Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: I've begun my remarks this morning by talking about momentum. The momentum we're building is apparent to our customers who seek the convenience and value of McDonald's great tasting food. It\u2019s apparent to our people; it\u2019s apparent to industry observers who are watching our transformation.  Getting to these results wasn't easy. And we need to continue to work hard to sustain performance as we face macroeconomic and industry uncertainties around the world. While we remain confident in our strategies, customers are rewarding us for the investments we're making to offer them great tasting food, a modern and hospitable environment, and unparalleled convenience. We all want to be associated with companies, organizations and brands that engage and inspire us, brands that are inclusive, fun, relevant and successful, brands that strive to improve communities and societies at large. That's where we're headed as we continue to unlock the potential of the Velocity Growth Plan and these accelerators. And it is why you'll see us continue to focus on our innovation and technology pipelines. This is our version of success. We're building a better McDonald\u2019s for a culture of innovation focused on a better customer experience, a culture that strives to make the jobs of restaurant employees easier, and a culture that is focused on sustaining long-term growth. This is our mindset as we push ourselves to execute our Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators with the strong sense of urgency, passion, and commitment. With that, we'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. Steven, can you give a little more context to the mix growth in U.S. that seems to be accelerating? Certainly outperformance outside the lower ticket breakfast occasion that's continued, as well as lapping $1 $2 $3 from last year helps. But, I think investors are wondering about the endurance, the customers\u2019 ability to continue to pay up, absent any growth in traffic. Relatively, the most tangible driver may be Dynamic Yield as we look forward. In the 700 stores that have added the initiative so far, have you experienced the consistent lift to sales, particularly on mix, once the drive-thru adds the initiative, or have the lifts of sales been more varied? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks, Andrew. As you say, clearly, this is a check-driven sales comp growth in the U.S. What I think is encouraging for us and gives us confidence that we build more sustaining platforms. It's the balance of how that check is built. So, we're about two-thirds improved product mix and one-third improved price. So, I think that's a fairly healthy balance. When you kind of drill into it, I mean, there's a number of elements that play in it, so helping with this. So, if we just look at some of the menu activity and promotional activity through the quarter for instance, there was a good local co-op initiative, which -- menu development co-ops initiative, particularly for the Easter period on the Filet-O-Fish promotion, which gave us an incremental lift. We've been pleased with the way the Worldwide Favorite promotion has worked, and that's beating or maybe this one exceeding our targets and is giving us incremental business. As we continue to innovate around the kind of the heart of the group platform, the Quarter Pounder cheese with different options around lettuce and tomato, that also works along with -- we actually realized lift on the Happy Meal business, particularly now we've reestablished the relationship with Disney. So, I think, there's a number of elements through just the menu and marketing piece that have given us -- building on platforms that has taken us a while to invest in or operationally embrace, but is now beginning to deliver more consistent results. Also we\u2019re seeing, as we convert the EOTF restaurants here, we're getting an incremental sales lift from that, some of which will come through growing and increasing use of the self order kiosks where we generate higher average checks as we mentioned before. Alongside delivery -- don't forget delivery, remember, very much -- as that becomes a large part of our business, we\u2019re still seeing about twice the average check on the typical delivery order as well. So, there's a number of contributors. It's not a one single contribution, or if you look through right across the business, I think it\u2019s the culmination. A lot of the initiatives that we've been investing in the last two or three years are beginning to come together, which is giving us encouragement. On Dynamic Yield, we've been really pleased. I'm going to say sort of three months in, couldn't be more pleased with the integration of Dynamic Yield, both as a company and as a culture, but also, frankly, getting the capabilities into our restaurants. So, we've been running 700 restaurants now for the best part of two and a half months. We're seeing consistent trends across different dayparts, across different days of week, across those 700. And that's certainly encouraged us with the support of our owner/operators, of course, to quite significantly accelerate the rollout. We know the technology works, we can plug it into our existing outdoor digital menu boards. So, we're going to go from about 800 now to 8,000 by this time, in two weeks\u2019 time, which is fantastic. And we would expect to see -- we have no reason to believe that the kind of lifts we are beginning to see, and I'm not going to go into those details, but kind of lifts we're seeing at the moment, we expect to continue across obviously the accelerated rollout. What\u2019s also been really encouraging to us on that front, it\u2019s subject to Dynamic Yield. We've taken it into our first international market and have gone very, very quickly from that 20 restaurants to 150 in Australia. The reason that's important is because -- and I don't want to get too much into it, but the content management system, the kind of the brain, which holds all the data, which Dynamic Yield product works after that produce work, we can show on the digital menu boards. Internationally, they have one typical content management system, and the U.S. has another. And we've been able to prove very, very quickly that the technology works on both platforms, which really indicates this is ready for a global expansion. So, we'll be careful that we don't get over our skis on it. But, the pulse of the market is strong. The excitement of the owner/operators is great. And the most probably rewarding or one of the most rewarding elements, one of the business results is it just makes the managers and crew life easier in the restaurant as well. And order-taking process is a little quicker because we don't have to manually suggest to sell, the technology does it for you. So, that is a long answer. But plenty of -- wide variety of initiatives, are helping support that. And not least by the way, just the fact that we\u2019re actually running the restaurants better. The focus we put on the drive-thrus, which I spoke about the last quarter, we\u2019re seeing drive-thru times dropping almost all of our major international markets, and notably here in the U.S. as well. So I'm going talk maybe more about that later.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. And Steve, I guess, while we're on the subject of speed of service, I just wanted to ask, I guess at the opening remarks, you talked about having a philosophy of not focusing on incremental change but focusing on more step changes in your overall strategy. So, I'm just wondering, if there's something on drive-thru speed that can accelerate the progress you're seeing? It seems like it's been fairly shallow so far, but perhaps I'm mistaken on that. And then maybe one clarification at the end, I just wanted to understand the traffic growth or traffic decline in the U.S. and Q2. Did that change from what you saw in Q1 or did it remain around the same level? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Well, let me take the drive-thru one. Once a year, we get our leaders from around the world together, so probably 60, 70 strong, including the managing directors of our top 20 markets. And we got together at the start of March. And whilst clearly it's been a really strong performance across the last 3 to 4 years, there are some areas where we know we need to do better. And we kind of had a white of the eyes conversation at the start of March. And we collectively agreed that we were going to renew some emphasis on the drive-thru service times. They've been going the wrong way with most of our markets for 3 or 4 years for reasons we can understand, as we\u2019ve added more to our business, but we knew that wasn\u2019t a sustaining trend.  So, when you talk about progress in the drive-thru, I mean, frankly, it will improve. We want to get incremental improvement week-to-week-to-week. So, each time a customer comes back, say a week or two later, they can notice a few seconds difference. There's been a ton of things we've done. We've had some centrally led initiatives but also some market dynamic. All the stuff from many some of the menu simplification moves that you would have read about, particularly here in the U.S. where we streamline the late night menu, removing of the signature crafted, which was slowing down service times, and giving some of the local co-ops a chance to roll back some of the all day breakfast rollout from the second phase. So, those things just helped smooth the operation in the kitchens. But, we\u2019re also introducing -- increasingly introducing technology, and diagnostic tools. Our managers and crew can see in real time in the drive-thru lanes. They can basically decompose the various elements of a drive-thru visit for a customer into its constituent seconds. So, how long are we taking to take the orders? How long are we taking to take the payment? How long it takes us to gather the food and present it? How many cars are we asking to pull forward and bring the food later? And just with that attention, we\u2019re beginning to see notable changes. So, it clearly takes off really by start of this quarter. Just to give you a slight sense of what we're seeing already. In June, for example, in the U.S., we saw a 15-second reduction year-on-year in service times in the drive-thru, which I would say is more than incremental. I mean, that's notable. And clearly, that's rewarding for customers, it's a smoother journey. It also helps us with throughput as well. So, there's certainly a lot more to do. But, I'm really encouraged. And in certain other international markets surpassing double that type of production with the focus we\u2019re putting on. So there's more to come. Kevin, you may want to talk a little bit to traffic decline?\nKevin Ozan: David, regarding guest counts in the U.S. in the second quarter. I think, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful change in the underlying guest count trend in the U.S.. The actual number for the second quarter was, I'll say, less negative than the first quarter. But, there were some specific things in the second quarter, some of which Steve mentioned earlier, things like the calendar shift with Eastern timing this year versus last year that a little bit benefited the second quarter; as Steve talked about, the Filet-O-Fish. We had about 70% of our co-ops that offered a Filet-O-Fish deal in Q2. That helped drive sales and guest count. And then Worldwide Favorites obviously was an LTO. That helped the second quarter too. So, while the actual number was less negative in the second quarter, I'd say there really hasn't been a meaningful change in the underlying trends.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just following on that. One clarification, if you could just provide some color on the breakfast side of the business in the U.S. I got the impression last quarter that you were keen to see the breakfast had turned more favorable. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether there was any accelerating momentum in the quarter, where it stands, the percentage of sales and maybe how breakfast compares to the to the rest of the day? And then, I just wanted to ask one other thing. Should we expect, Kevin, an update on the return of cash targets as we now finish out \u201819 and we're going to get another three-year bucket as we look out through the next few years or how should we think about the outlook for that going forward? Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: Hi, Jeff. I'll take the first one. We did see a better trading performance in the breakfast daypart in quarter two, the combination of local activity with a local comp support, plus we did get to see some strong results out of the McCaf\u00e9 initiatives and the donut sticks that would be launched in the first quarter as well. So, on the daypart, we grew sales. It was still the slowest growing daypart amongst the day, but we're back to a solid sales growth. There\u2019s still guest count decline as I think we mentioned before, as there's been plenty of other entrants who are competing in the breakfast market, and we don't have it all our own way, the way perhaps we used to, back in the day. So, it remains competitive. We\u2019ve got sales growth. We're encouraged by that, but we know we\u2019ve got more work to do.\nKevin Ozan: And regarding returning of cash target. So, as you know, this year, we\u2019ll complete our three-years $25 billion target. We're on track to do that. So, we'll finish that this year. Later in the year, then, we'll provide an update as far as what that means going forward, perhaps beginning in 2020.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you just update us maybe on the U.S. franchisee relationships? In particular, I think you slowed down the EOTF rollout in concession to them. But now, you're talking about profits, for eight months rising? Is there a greater enthusiasm to embrace this maybe and pull forward some of the things you talked about in \u201821 and \u201822 and get it done faster? Can you also talk about maybe where they stand or where you stand on delivery? I think there was some friction around commissions and sort of the economics of that. Have you resolved some of those issues? And I think there were some adjustments you made -- plan to make in the back half, just what those adjustments to royalty or rent relief associated with that. Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes, thanks, John. As I\u2019ve said before, 2018 was a really hard work year. I mean, both the other operators, and the company invested a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of money in really kick starting the bigger, bolder vision, as the plan they built. And that does create tensions at a point in time, and that's natural. We worked our way through them. I would say that by easing off -- the speed of the EOTF -- those owner/operators who wanted a bit of breathing room, were able to select that and push one or two projects out which gave them a lot more confidence and comfort. That said, the results we\u2019re getting from the EOTF rollout are really strong, and they are similar -- very similar to what we've seen elsewhere in the world. So, you\u2019ll find, the majority of owner/operators are sticking with the original plan, the accelerated plan, really to complete their businesses by the end of 2020. It will be optional for owner/operators to pull their projects forward if they want to in 2021 and 2022. They're welcome to. We'll be ready for it. I think what it has also given us is -- I mean, we're a wonderful learning organization as a system. We're always driving curious to get better. And if we look at the performance of EOTF, as an example, because you mentioned it, the downtime of the projects, we're about 2 to 4 days better this year than we were in 2018, which clearly helps get the business back on track. The time to recover the sales as in when you reopen, getting yourselves back up to the levels, that recovery time is quicker. And also, the dip during the closure is a little less this year than it was last year. So, I think our execution around these 2,000 projects this year is sharper, but probably those 3 elements, which again builds confidence in the owner/operators that this is going to be a stronger business outcome for them. With delivery, yes, we\u2019re clearly keen to roll this out. The owner/operators know this is a great business opportunity. We have, around the world, with our owner/operators in each of our markets to find an arrangement with them as to how we can best take some of the heat out of the commission costs they face in order to make it encouraging. We want them to make money out of it and we, as a company, will make money as a result. So, I think we're in a far better place. I think probably the two indicators just here in the U.S. that will demonstrate the confidence the owner/operators have is that once we settled on this new rent arrangement with them, I think, it was within about a week, they voted on a national marketing campaign with Uber Eats to put marketing dollars behind delivery. And the eagerness with which they've embraced the second and third-party operator being DoorDash. I mentioned in my opening comments, we\u2019ve got around 200 restaurants in Houston on DoorDash at the moment. And that's just really making sure we integrate the technology and get the operation right. By the end of August, we\u2019re going to have probably two ways of around 4,000-plus restaurants. So, we\u2019ll be up at about 9,000 on DoorDash by the end of August, again, just showing you the speed we're going, and hence the owner/operator commitment behind it. And we've got already about 9,000 with our kind of our key strategic partners as Uber Eats. There's no perfect crossover. There\u2019s going be about an additional 1,200 restaurants that have either one or other depending on coverage. That means, there is about 8,000, which we\u2019ll have two third-party operators. And yes, we've seen around the world that gives us good incremental delivery business. Customers are typically, not solely, but typically are loyal to one third-party operator app. So, we know what we're seeing from Canada when we added SkipTheDishes to the Uber Eats platform. We\u2019ve also seen elsewhere around the world, such as in Italy where we\u2019ve got three, where we\u2019ve got Glovo, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. So, we\u2019ve got good experience of work in multiple delivery partners and we're confident the incrementally will come with it, and then, as a result, the cash flow to the operators. But ultimately, the mood of the operators, I think are feeling much more confident. By May of this year, their cash flow growth eclipsed the decline that they saw in 2018. So, as you can imagine, that gives people a great sense of satisfaction. June continued that. So, we now have 8 months in a row of cash flow growth. And they're confident and committed to maintaining that such trend forward, because they\u2019ve committed a lot to this plan, they committed a lot to our business and we want them to build business growth and success.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGreg Francfort: Thanks for the question. Just maybe going back to the drive-thru times, can you quantify how much those were up? And then, I guess, the question is, how much have you recaptured with the 15-second, and what percentage of what you have seen in increased in the last few years? And then, how much opportunity do you think there is going forward? And what's the key strategy to address as that as there are changes you have to make on the product front or menu front to kind of capture more time savings? Thank you very much.\nSteve Easterbrook: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t get into all the details of drive-thru service. They do differ by country as well, obviously, depending on how busy the drive-thrus are. I mean, we've got certain markets in Europe where drive-thru is only about 40% of the business of a drive-thru restaurant whereas here in the U.S., it can be upwards of 70% to 75%. So, that creates a totally different service time dynamic. I would say, across the major markets. As we sat down in March, we wanted to set ourselves abundantly to be about 30 seconds better, which we knew would be notable, and not to be notable to the customer and also then business enhancing as this eases up throughput, particularly in those peak service times. Obviously, that's the most critical time to do it. There's a number of different initiatives to it. I mean, some of it is just getting the focus, I mean, understandably with the aggressive rollout of Experience of the Future. There was a heightened focus in store, front counter dining area, we\u2019re just rebalancing that. So it's just the focus on the drive-thru, people positioning, making sure we\u2019re starting right training and the basics. But, there are certain things for example, on menu, and I think we've got a far more forensic ability through our global operations team and our innovation center now to analyze the complexity of our menus by market and identify those slower-moving items that really are not contributing much to incremental margin and certainly not selling in many volumes, but great barriers to service. So, those diagnostic tools and forensic tools we have now is providing the information into each of the markets, they can make smart menu decisions. But it's not just about the menus around technology as well, and actually just making it fun. I mean, we've had a number of service competitions around all the markets. And particularly now we're getting these tools to the restaurants, to the managers. When I first saw this, the drive-thrus timer tools in Canada probably 12 to 18 months ago and then saw them rolled out in Europe probably about 12 months ago. There is a majority in the U.S. drive-thrus now. Probably what captured my attention among anything else was the enthusiasm the managers and the crew had to that kind of local competition, how are you doing most of the drive-thrus in your area, drive-thrus in your owner/operator group, or the drive-thrus that have similar volume to you. So, we can use these tools in many ways to A, identify where the barriers are but actually just make it fun, incentivize and getting enthusiasm in management and crew. So, more to come. I'm encouraged with where we\u2019re at. We\u2019ve some markets which are actually 30, 40 seconds quicker now just three or four months in. So, they've got a bigger opportunity than some but they're making good headway. And the U.S., I'm proud of where the U.S. is at. I know they're focused on getting better than the 50. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. \nDennis Geiger: Thanks for the questions. I wanted just to ask a bit more about the U.S. guest counts. Maybe if you could just highlight a bit more where you're seeing progress and where the biggest opportunities are to continue to show that improvement? And then I guess within that context, Steve, I think you've talked in the past about a growth strategy to retain customers, regain customers and convert casual customers. Any update there you could give, specifically on the converting the casual customer, and if that's still how you're thinking about getting that discount up in the U.S.? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Dennis, it's Kevin. I'll take a stab at that and Steve can chime in. As far as progress or opportunity, I think, as we've talked about, certainly one of our biggest opportunities continues to be at breakfast. As Steve talked about, there's been a lot of new entrants into that space. So, there's not many players that are growing, comp guest count at breakfast, or really in most of the dayparts. But new entrants have kind of caused a scattering, I'll say, of the existing guest counts among just more units. As far as retain, regain convert, the convert strategy for us was always around kind of opportunities in either other dayparts or other areas that we didn't have our fair share, if you will. So areas like coffee and snacking and areas that are potential further growth opportunities, but we're not as strong in some of those areas. It wasn't necessarily taking some of our existing customers and just having them come more frequently. So, there still are opportunities in some of those areas, again, like coffee and like snacking. I think, the way, we think about it is, there's an opportunity, and this is what kind of one of the purposes of both EOTF and our digital is to take our existing relationship with customers, and expand that relationship through digital means, whether that's through apps, further loyalty program at some point. But, the whole customer relationship where we can get to know and personalize offers easier and better for existing customers. That's one of our big opportunities. The U.S. guest counts will continue to be a, we call it a street fight just because it's a very competitive environment here in the U.S. But, I think, there is more of a focus on what do we need to do in the various dayparts. Again, breakfast probably being the biggest opportunity for us to regain some of those guest counts that we lost. And it really is about, we call it losing guest count, but it's not losing customers, it's losing customer visits. So, it's customers that may not be visiting us as often as they were historically. And if we can regain some of those additional visits, especially a breakfast time, which is, as you know, a very habitual ritual. And so, if we can get those customers coming again at breakfast, it would be a huge benefit.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just to support Kevin's comments, particularly around the, if you like, the technology ecosystem we're building here. For us to have a personalized relationship with our customers, which I think will be valuable to us and also make it valuable to them, we've got to find ways for them to identify themselves, when they enter the drive-through, without slowing the drive-through process down, identify themselves at the self order kiosk. And again, even though this is less pressure on time there, you don't want it to slow them down. Or for example, if they're having home delivery, and when we get some route delivery through the McDonald\u2019s app and we're working with our partner of Uber Eats, we're going to be getting the ability to route those orders through the McDonald\u2019s app. Once we can start a link, a drive-through transactions, to in-store transactions to home delivery, we started to build a really good picture of our customers and eventually person-by-person. I think that will be incredibly valuable for us to make ourselves more relevant and more interesting to those customers. And from customer perspective, just make the experience smoother and more enjoyable. So, you'd expect to hear more, there are certainly some initiatives we\u2019ve been working on the markets right now on those. Nothing to say at scale yet, but I can assure you the culture of innovation that we've got going here is playing out. We've got a number of initiatives in number of our markets, we're learning very, very quickly how best to identify customers or customers to choose by themselves is a better way of saying it, at drive-thru and the in-store, we believe we've got the home delivery piece already initiated. I'm really excited about what they could offer to business.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower: Great, thanks. I just wanted to talk quickly on the unit growth. I think today, you bumped up your expectations for 2019 to 800 stores net. And over the past two years, you've seen a nice jump in absolute net numbers. So, can you discuss whether or not you expect this type of net openings to persist in the future? What's fueling this growth or franchisees in new markets, seeing better returns than in the past? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. Couple of things. First, related to the I'll call it change, slight change in guidance in the outlook section of the release. Really, what's driving that net additions number of about 50 higher than it was last quarter is less closings. So, our gross openings number for this year will be similar to what we thought it was going to be, but the closings that we originally anticipated, beginning the year a little bit lower. And about half of those are in our Developmental Licensed markets and about half of them are in the International Operated markets, half of the change in closing that is.  As far as how we think about unit growth, there's still a lot of potential, even in our mature markets. So, markets like Canada, France, Italy, Spain, have a lot of opportunity to continue growing new units, and the U.S. even long-term we believe. Now, what's helpful in the way we've changed our business model is what you actually see is right now substantially, the large portion of openings are in our Developmental Licensed markets, China and the other DL markets, which use their capital. So, it\u2019s a pretty efficient way for us to grow. So, you should expect to see continued growth in new units, again, both in the DL markets by our partners, as well as in our more mature markets that we own, like the ones I just spoke about.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just to add on to that. I just want to give a shout out to some of the mid-size operated markets. Recently I've been in Italy, Poland, Netherlands, I mean, these markets are doing double-digit sales comps on top of double-digit sales comps. And hence, that\u2019s creating clearly significant increase in volumes and throughput of restaurants and putting some capacity pressure on. So, I\u2019d tell you, desire in the market is to sort of pick up the openings a little bit. I'm heading out to Russia in about two months time to spend some time there with the team. And again with a strong growth at both guest counts and sales they are seeing, I know they have an ambition for growth. And if you remember, we previously called that segment the high growth segment, and that was because we expected them to grow units at a greater pace than the perhaps the more mature market. So, we're keeping a real close eye on it. And the stronger we grow the business, then the stronger the confidence level is to grow the units as well. So, more to come by the end of the year.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Can you guys talk a little bit more about your store level margins in the United States? It's the first time, they've expanded in five quarters, and certainly were much healthier level than all of us analysts were forecasting. I know you said refranchising with the positive impact, Kevin, but I think probably a similar impact, as you've seen in recent quarters. So, are the franchisees seeing a similar margin trend change this quarter? And if so, what drove that? And then just following up on the EOTF. Can you tell us what the net impact you believe EOTF was on comps this quarter and how you expect that to change into the second half? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Let me start with the store level margins. And I guess, I'll talk about company operated margins, because obviously, we have -- those are our restaurants. So, I can see a lot of detail related to those. I think, one of the big differences is -- certainly comps in the second quarter were higher than they were, let's say in the first quarter. And obviously higher comps definitely help that. But the other thing I'd say is there's a little bit more stability in the restaurants in 2019 than 2018. Steve talked earlier about kind of the hard work and all the things that we threw at the restaurant in 2018, including EOTF, a lot of projects, fresh beef, the restructure we did in the field, all those changes that kind of impacted the restaurants. And so, kind of as we've now kind of I\u2019ll say stabilize the business a little bit, and just have less overall initiative deployment, as well as slowing the pace or getting near the end of kind of our refranchising, the restaurants are now able to just focus on running the restaurants as efficiently as possible. So, we saw kind of more efficiency in labor productivity in the second quarter than we've seen in the -- than we saw in the first quarter and last year. On the franchisees side, we've talked about their cash flow is up. So, their unit level economics have been doing well, similarly. So, I think that's probably the biggest change as far as what we're seeing in margin versus last year, certainly. Related to EOTF, I'd say the benefit in the second quarter was a little higher than it was in the first quarter, and we would expect that to be relatively similar for the remaining quarters of this year. As we said, we completed about a 1,000 projects this year, but as you -- so far this year of our 2,000 that will complete in total. But that's coming off of finishing about 4,500 last year. So, we have a big base of projects that are now complete that we're seeing the benefit of, in addition to kind of improvement in how we're doing those projects, as Steve talked about less downtime, quicker recovery, et cetera. So, we expect those EOTF benefits to continue. And obviously, as we have completed more projects, that certainly helps future results.\nMike Cieplak: As we near the top of the hour, we'll take one final question from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: I just have two quick follow-ups, if I may. The first was on the EOTF and traffic in the U.S. I had been in the impression that last year, part of the issue was during the store closures you lost some traffic. And I would have thought maybe you'd have gotten that back this year. But, it sounds sort of like, you haven't gotten the traffic back so much as the customers that are still going to McDonald\u2019s are just spending more and EOTF is supporting that. I just wanted to understand the dynamics there between like -- and lapping the closures? And then just on China, are you seeing any cannibalization? We've noticed across the board a lot of restaurants taking up unit growth in China and seeing their comp decelerate accordingly. Is that something that you have to contemplate, or are you still so underpenetrated, it's not really an issue there.\nKevin Ozan: I can start with EOTF. Related to EOTF. So, last year, as you mentioned, we had restaurants closed, the ones that needed to be -- primarily the ones that had the big projects what we call non-modernized, so the ones where we needed to do a remodel plus the EOTF components. This year, while there's less number of projects being done, there are a higher percentage of those non-mods being done. And so, while we've gotten better at reducing the amount of time that they're closed, we still have some of those closures. Now, that isn't the only issue obviously related to traffic though. Again, to be fair, we were losing traffic before we started the EOTF, and that won't fix all the issues related to traffic. So, the traffic piece is beyond just EOTF. And as we've gotten better and done more of these EOTF projects, we're getting better at completing those. But that in and of itself won't resolve all of the traffic issues.\nSteve Easterbrook: Just to pick up on the China question, Sara. We had really strong system-wide sales growth in China for the quarter. Clearly, we've got a rapid pace of expansion of new restaurant openings, but we also grew sales and grew guest count in the quarter as well. So core business is robust. And I would say probably exceeding the opening plans that we've initially expected. I mean, if you look at the five-year period ending 2022, our partners are looking to exceed more than 2,000 openings that are certainly on track at the moment. And having called out recently, there are -- been very confident moving out of the same level of business. I mean, it's incredibly competitive. You've seen the pace at which other people are expanding. But it is a huge market. The emerging middle class, there's a greater affordability of the mass population there is heading towards Western QSR type of average checks and affordability. So, it's certainly a market we're excited about, we\u2019re very confident about the long-term future there, and really pleased with the way the partners are working out as well. They're doing terrific job. So, it'll be more than 400 openings this year after about 400 plus last year as well. And if they can keep the sales comps going at the same time, then, clearly, that indicates a healthy position for the business.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us. Have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-30 18:02:10", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's First Quarter 2019 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call this m morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: We're off to a strong start for 2019. Our broad-based momentum around the world continues as we further execute on our Velocity Growth Plan. Global comparable sales increased 5.4%. That's over $1 billion of growth across the system for the quarter. This marks our 15th consecutive quarter of positive global comp sales despite some of the continuing macroeconomic uncertainties around the world. We also grew global guest counts for the quarter. In the U.S. we are pleased with our performance to start the year. The market continues to execute against the most ambitious plan in our history. And whilst we recognize we have a lot of hard work ahead of us we are encouraged with our progress and improved franchisee cash flow to start the year. Our customer satisfaction scores are improving as more guests are able to enjoy McDonald's in our modernized Experience of the Future restaurants. For the first time since we've begun our EOTF rollout we are seeing a benefits to our overall U. S. sales comp. Where 2018 focused on considerable transformation and building a foundation for growth our 2019 focus is on operation execution in our restaurants and optimizing the experience for our customers. For example the UK. has now achieved a remarkable 13 consecutive years of comparable sales growth. The market's focus on value menu innovation and McDelivery is resulting in balanced growth in both average check and guest counts including record high guest counts for the month of March. We're also seeing strong performance in Australia. I visited Sydney and Melbourne last month and continue to be impressed with how the team is successfully driving growth across all dayparts. The market has now grown comparable sales for the past 20 consecutive quarters. With strong leadership and franchisee alignment the market's excelling at the fundamentals of running great restaurants growing their delivery business and leveraging the investments we've made in digital. Our customers in Australia are also taking notice of the effort we are putting into delivering delicious feel-good moments. Today more customers are using our global mobile app and McDelivery to order delicious McDonald's food on their terms. And an increasing number of customers are choosing to use our self-order kiosks to place their orders. The Australia team has more than doubled McDelivery awareness through our strong partnership with Uber Eats. And with our barista trained crew executing at a high-level both in restaurants and in the drive-thru coffee has become the most frequently ordered item on our McDonald's app. The Progress we are seeing in the US, UK and Australia demonstrates how our Velocity Growth plan is working and enabling us to deliver broad-based growth across our segments. With that I'll turn it over to Kevin to share more about our top line performance.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Steve. With global comp sales up 5.4% for the quarter each of our operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. As a reminder in January we evolved our organizational structure to support our more heavily franchised business model enabling even more sharing and scaling of best practices and innovations across markets. Not only does our new structure provide operational benefits it also increases visibility into the contributions made to our overall business by both our wholly owned markets and our Developmental Licensee markets. First quarter for the U.S. was strong with comparable sales growth of 4.5% and all dayparts contributing to the growth. While comp guest counts were negative for the quarter the U.S. continues to experience strong average check growth driven by balanced contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing. Consumer relevant national promotions such as the bacon event and the two for $5 Mix and Match deal which included our fresh beef quarter pounders for the first time performed well in the quarter. We also introduced Donut Sticks at the Breakfast daypart and this new item resonated with our customers. Throughout 2019 we'll continue to pulse in national deals like the two for $5 Mix and Match that was re-launched yesterday. These deals will complement local value at both breakfast and on the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu as individual co-ops decide which menu items resonate best with their customers. As we continue on our EOTF journey in the US and as Steve mentioned earlier we are now seeing an overall net positive contribution to comp sales from our aggressive modernization efforts. This means that the sales lifts from completed projects now exceed the downtime impact from current projects under construction. During the quarter we converted an additional 400 restaurants to EOTF. We have now completed over 8,000 EOTF restaurants or about 60% of our estate in the US. We still expect to complete approximately 2,000 projects this year. Turning to the International Operated segment. Comp sales were up 6%. The largest contributors in the segment were our big five international markets: Australia Canada France Germany and the UK with the UK and France leading the way. France experienced its highest comp sales increase since 2011 along with its highest ever market share. The market is successfully optimizing products such as the Big Tasty and Big Mac bacon along with new promotional offerings. And last month France also began serving our iconic Egg McMuffin all day. Finally comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were also up 6% for the quarter with each geographic region in the segment growing both comp sales and guest counts. China continues to be a competitive market. Late in the quarter we introduced a new everyday value offering which complements our Extra Value Meal launch in late 2018. We also opened more than 90 new restaurants in the quarter in China driving growth in systemwide sales and a gain in market share and we're well on our way to opening about 400 restaurants for the year. Now I'll turn it back to Steve to expand on the accelerators which are enabling our global growth.\nSteve Easterbrook: Thanks Kevin. Since the launch of the Velocity Growth Plan we've been increasingly focused on using technology to make our customers experience easier and more convenient when they visit our restaurants. From our global mobile app to our self-order kiosks to our digital menu boards we've established our digital foundation. We've created an ecosystem that more and more of our customers are using to order pay and receive the delicious McDonald's food on their terms. Now we're building on that foundation with our recent acquisition of Dynamic Yield a leader in personalization and decision logic technology. Dynamic Yield's technology varies suggested offers by time of day weather and trending menu items. Over time using data from the millions of customers that we serve daily the technology will get smarter and smarter through machine learning. And using the data collected based on current restaurant traffic at the drive-thru the technology will begin to suggest items that can make peak times easier on our restaurant operations and crew. We've already begun our rollout and now have the technology up and running in 700 drive-thrus across the U. S. Long term this technology will work across all of our digital platforms including our self-order kiosks and our global mobile approximately. When our technology ecosystem is linked it will provide a seamless ordering experience for our customers and we'll leverage our size and scale to take advantage of being one of the first brick-and-mortar companies to integrate decision logic into the customer ordering process. By acquiring Dynamic Yield we also have access to strong data science and engineering talent who will help us stay ahead of the curve when it comes to connecting with our customers in more personalized ways. This acquisition is just one tangible demonstration of the steps we're taking to leverage industry-leading innovative technology to accelerate our growth and offer our customers and even easier more enjoyable experience. In addition to using technology to create seamless experiences we're also maintaining our focus on improving the fundamentals of running great restaurants. For example drive-thru remains a popular way for many of our customers to order their Big Macs Chicken McNuggets french fries and more. That's why we've never been more focused on improving the experience of the drive-thru. In particular the speed of service. Many of the improvements we're exploring at scale are taken from best practices we've seen in markets around the world. In Italy having a disciplined daily focus on running great restaurants has helped the market deliver some of the strongest sales performance in its history. As part of their overall effort to strengthen operations they identified an opportunity to improve speed of service by running multiple drive-thru competitions in the restaurants. With our crew fully engaged they were able to make meaningful reductions in drive-thru service times and customers are noticing. Our customer satisfaction scores have increased across all categories from speed of service to friendliness to accuracy. And in the U.S. our restaurants participated in an incentive program where they competed against each other to deliver the best drive-thru service times in a fun and engaging way. We introduced the competition in the middle of Q1 and it made a difference with lower service times whilst improving guest counts in many of our restaurants. I'd like to personally congratulate our Boise Twin Falls Idaho Falls co-op for winning our first quarter drive-thru challenge. But more importantly for serving our guests faster at the critical breakfast daypart. As of our customers' expectations for service keep evolving we'll continue to share our best learnings like these across the globe. The work we're doing to improve drive-thru service times is only one way we are ensuring we run great restaurants. We're also are finding new ways to create more excitement around our customers favorite core menu items by using existing ingredients which ensures we do not add complexity for our restaurant operations and crew. For example after a successful limited time offering of Big Mac Bacon Burgers in Canada we launched campaigns to connect with consumers love for bacon during the quarter with similar offerings in the UK France and Russia. And in the U. S. we entice customers to add bacon not only to their Big Macs but also to our fresh beef quarter pounders. The US market even stole shamelessly from our friends in Australia by introducing cheesy bacon fries. This kind of smart menu innovation is a great example of how we're able to surprise and delight our customers whilst balancing their demands for speed of service with the complexity of operating at the scale of McDonald's. We are pleased with the enhancements we're making to the experience guests have when they visit our restaurants but we also know how important it is continue meeting our customers increasing demands for convenience especially through delivery. Delivery remains a key part of our Velocity Growth Plan. It has been one of our most successful accelerators from the start likely due to the speed at which we began to implement it and because we began scaling our delivery offering at a time when customers are eating out less. Delivery has grown to a $3 billion business for both McDonald's company and franchise restaurants globally and we believe there's a lot more opportunity to grow. We now offer McDelivery in over 20,000 restaurants across more than 75 countries which is more than half of all McDonald's restaurants globally. Our ability to continue expanding our delivery reach further demonstrates how our size scale and convenient locations close to customers gives us a tremendous advantage. We're seeing solid growth in delivery and it continues to be a meaningful contributor to comp sales in a number of markets. Awareness remains one of our greatest opportunities with delivery so we're committed to making sure more and more customers are aware of McDelivery and the opportunity that exists for them to enjoy McDonald's wherever they are. Now I'll turn it over to Kevin for our financial highlights of the quarter.\nKevin Ozan: Earnings per share was $1.72 for the quarter a 5% increase in constant currencies. Our results benefited from strong operating performance despite lapping higher gains on sales of restaurants due to our heavier refranchising activity in first quarter 2018. While we still have some ongoing refranchising of restaurants our major refranchising efforts are winding down. We grew revenue 2% in constant currencies for the quarter marking our first quarter of growth since our refranchising strategy began in earnest in 2016. Given our strong comp sales performance overall margin dollars increased in all segments and grew more than $100 million in constant currencies on a consolidated basis. This contributed to our operating margin for the quarter of 42.3% reflecting growth of 60 basis points versus last year. Our franchise margin dollars grew 7% in constant currencies. Due to a change in presentation of sublease income and expense within franchise margins as a result of the new lease accounting standard our franchise margin percent was negatively impacted 70 basis points. To be clear there is no impact to our franchise margin dollars as a result of the new standard but this reset of the franchise margin percent will be ongoing. Our overall franchise margin percent declined 120 basis points due to this accounting change as well as depreciation expense related to EOTF in the U.S. Turning to our company-operated restaurants. Consolidated margins declined 20 basis points to 15.8% for the quarter. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 40 basis points as our strong sales performance more than offset higher labor and occupancy costs. US company-operated margins were challenged due to continuing labor pressures along with higher commodity costs and EOTF-related depreciation. In the U.S. first quarter pricing was up about 2% while commodity costs for the quarter increased approximately 3%. While we expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat throughout the year we now anticipate our U.S. grocery basket will be up 2% to 3% for the full year. Across the big five markets in the IOM segment menu prices averaged about 2% higher and commodity costs were up about 1.5% for the quarter. We still expect commodities to be up about 2% for the full year. G&A for the quarter was down 4% in constant currencies at 2.1% of systemwide sales. Steve talked earlier about the strategic purchase of Dynamic Yield to advance our digital capabilities. As a result of this acquisition along with some R&D investments in other areas of technology we now expect full year G&A spend to be relatively flat in constant currencies versus last year. Our effective tax rate was 27.5% for the quarter as we finalized the application of new regulations issued in the first quarter related to U.S. tax reform. We still expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Foreign currency translation hurt our first quarter results by $0.09 per share. At current exchange rates we expect the impact of foreign currency to be slightly less for Q2 and then ease in the back half of the year with an estimated full year headwind of $0.18 to $0.20. As usual this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year. Now I'll turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Easterbrook: In addition to our intense focus on driving performance as one of the world's largest restaurant companies and most recognizable brands we know we have the responsibility and opportunity to take action on some of the most pressing social and environmental challenges in the world today. Last year we announced priorities where we felt we could use our scale for good to make the biggest difference in areas that intersect directly with our business operations. These areas include climate action sustainable beef packaging and recycling our commitment to families and youth opportunity. We've continued to make progress in these areas and other parts of our food supply chain by collaborating with millions of customers employees franchisees suppliers and other partners. For example prior to our Scale for Good campaign we set a bold target to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025 in the U.S. Now just 3.5 years into the 10-year plan we're proud to announce that the U.S. is already one-third of the way toward fulfilling our goal. This means that over 725 million cage-free eggs will be served in our U.S. restaurants in 2019. And many of our other global markets are also in the process of transitioning to cage-free eggs. In addition to using our scale for good we're continuing to make a broader set of investments in people across the entire McDonald's System. Together with our franchisees we provide jobs for almost 2 million people across the world and are one of the world's largest employers of women. Whilst women have strong representation in leadership positions throughout our organization and in the U. S. make up 60% of all restaurants managers. We're committed to making even more progress. That's why by 2023 we will improve the representation of women at all levels of the company achieve gender equality in career advancements and champion the impacts of women on the business. We recently announced this commitment on International Women's Day as we launched Better Together a sweeping initiative to improve gender balance and diversity. As part of this we'll put training and systems in place to enhance equality in career advancement for women. And we'll be encouraging our franchisees and suppliers worldwide to deliver strategies that promote gender balance and diversity. Just before I wrap up my prepared remarks I did want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of someone who played a pivotal role in McDonald's. Last week Jeff Stratton former President of McDonald's USA passed away. Jeff was with McDonald's for over 40 years and in that time, also ran our global restaurant Solutions Group, our Innovation center and at one-time our food improvement teams around the world. He had an unwavering passion for running great restaurants and there was no greater brand ambassador than him. Jeff truly made us better. We always say that McDonald's is an organization built on people and Jeff's contribution at McDonald's will always be remembered. As I close despite any uncertainties we have one of the world's most iconic brands we're leveraging technology to improve and modernize the way we connect with our customers we have a dynamic menu of delicious affordable food offerings our customers value and enjoy. We have great suppliers who partner with us to deliver at the scale of McDonald's. We have the most dedicated franchisees who are committed to running great restaurants. And we have the world's best and hardest working crews striving every day to delight our customers. When we bring all these elements together we are confident about the road ahead and we are well positioned to win for the long term. And now we'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for taking my question. My question is related to traffic trends in the US. I was wondering how U.S. traffic trended through the quarter and specifically to what extent the peed of service competition introduced mid quarter helped improve the traffic trajectory? And is the benefit from drive-thru competition sustainable? Or does it fall off when the incentive goes away? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. Eric I'll start with traffic. So we said traffic was negative in the U.S. I guess I'd say it's in line with kind of where it's been the last few quarters. No significant change in trend as far as the overall traffic number. And I'll Steve do you want to talk about the competitions in the drive-thru?\nSteve Easterbrook: Yeah. Absolutely. I think, just further context around why we're focusing on this. As you can imagine the last probably 12 to 18 months the majority of the focus has been on the in-restaurant dining experience we were rapidly rolling out Experience of the Future. We're focusing on kitchen procedures as we roll out fresh beef quarter pounders for example. And we just thought this was the right time given a lot of that disruptive activity we've worked our way through that now. We can get back to the basics of focusing on running better restaurants. So we decided to kick off with a focus on drive-thru during the peak hours of breakfast which was clearly an opportunity for us. And yeah, we managed to reduce service times which is really encouraging. It was a later start in the quarter. But certainly the enthusiasm in the kind of co-op to co-op competitions was great. So we're going to continue with a series of these throughout this year. And certainly having been in the field I was in Miami and Fort Myers towards the end of the quarter I was in Atlanta and Baton Rouge Indiana at the start of the quarter certainly the conversation amongst our field leadership and owner/operators is they're excited about having a clean run at 2019 because we really can just focus the managers the crew and all of our attention on just the fundamentals of running great restaurants. So encouraged by the start, want to see some drive-thru service time decreases. We did see decreases in service time in the U.S. in the quarter. And it's not just the U.S. by the way. This is a global focus that we had a start of year meeting will all of the managing directors of our major markets. And we're seeing some remarkable results in countries like Germany Italy Poland Spain anywhere between 20 and 40 seconds taken off the drive-thru service times literally just within that quarter. So I just really I guess just want to express there is organizational enthusiasm around this and it's great that we get into these sorts of conversations with each other because this is what we enjoy and this is what we are good at but we want to get better at.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. I have two separate questions. Steve it's been clear very clear since the February franchisee leadership Council election there's better alignment in the US system between you and the operators and that's definitely evidenced in part by 1Q's improvement in sales. After the EOTF CapEx contribution of 55% was extended in November by one year from 2019 to 2020 how sacrosanct is keeping that 2020 deadline for the elevated CapEx contribution to help build on the momentum of improved relations? And then, Kevin a separate question for you. You previously guided that the EOTF benefit to comps was more likely to be a second half 2019 benefit. Kudos obviously for the benefit in 1Q. But could you talk about why the first quarter did in fact benefit from net remodels beyond conservatism in the guidance? And if you could also quantify the 1Q contribution for the EOTF that would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: Okay, Andrew, I'll take the first couple of those questions because I think there was a third and a fourth one. But Owner/Operator sentiment it's been a really constructive quarter. I mean again just to provide the context I often say there are four differentiating advantages that McDonald's has already over anyone else in our sector. Geographic spread I think is one of those which makes it incredibly resilient. Just The iconic brands is a differentiator for us. Our financial strength both at a restaurant level organizational level as well. And the fourth is our Owner/operators. And just having constructive relations with the owner/operators and our market leadership always puts us in a stronger position. So with the newly elected leadership of the National Franchisee Leadership Alliance there's been really constructive dialogue about how do we remove any barriers to growth so we can all get after what we want to do, which is serving more customers more often. So it's been a good quarter. I think there's been really constructive dialogue. Everything from unlocking one or two of the opportunities that we can get after the McDelivery opportunity more so, as well as now the local co-ops are beginning to invest a little bit more on our marketing spend on a local basis rather than national. And again to put that into context. Certainly the vast majority of our marketing spend in quarter one last year was national as we launched the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu. We've actually now swung to a little bit more of an equal balance certainly in this first quarter as we've got behind local value and local breakfast support as well. So I think all these things are helping just get the right balance in how we leverage our scale but also recognize the local differences as you go around the country. With regards to EOTF. We did want to ease just some of the financial and any of the concerns operators had around the financial burden of the rapid rollout. So we offered an extra couple of years at a slightly lower supported level pretty much more our typical support level. But the heightened support in the US through 2020 that just gave each and every Owner/Operator an opportunity just to what we would call level load their projects if they felt was going to be too much of a pinch too much pressure on their balance sheets through 2019 and 2020. I guess what's been interesting is the operators have really appreciated that option but the majority are still choosing to complete the EOTF projects by 2020. So I would say that we would still expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2020. But those who felt they need a little bit longer have appreciated that opportunity and we'll support them with that as well. But it will be at the reduced level. Partly because by the time we get to 2021 and 2022 we're going to have other ways to allocate our investment support that we think will be better for the long-term business.\nKevin Ozan: And then the EOTF benefit that you mentioned Andrew. We were saying we expected it to turn around mid-year 2019. I guess I'll say there was a little bit of conservatism in that. But we also have been able to reduce our downtime on projects as we've gotten into 2019. I think last year I talked about that there were a few things we were looking at. One to be able to reduce downtime a little bit. And two to be able to have kind of grander reopening plans so that when restaurants came back up they were able to recover the sales quicker. And we've done a little bit better job on each of those. And so the fact that we had about 400 projects in the U.S. now in the first quarter and having all those projects that were completed in 2018 certainly made it a net positive as we got into the first quarter. We would expect that net positive to continue now ongoing for the rest of the year. We don't want to quantify each quarter's benefit because we don't want to get into a quarter by quarter benefit it's effectively built into now our ongoing business. But we do expect that to continue for the rest of the year now.\nSteve Easterbrook: And just to add on again just to emphasize the remarkable speed with which we completed projects in 2018 was clearly incredibly hard work. But what it means is now as we turn into this year you've got more than 50-50 chance of visiting a modern looking McDonald's that represents the direction we're heading into as opposed to reflecting on the past. So we're over the halfway mark which as we have noticed from other markets around the world. Once you cross that kind of 50% as I say just from an everyday customer experience there's more chance you're going to be going to a great-looking McDonald's restaurant where the service experience is smoother the technology is more supportive in helping you through all that. So we feel good about where we're at. And we still completed 400 projects this quarter. So still feel like we're off to a good start this year.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: And thanks for sharing the news on Jeff as sad as that is it is. He my question is a couple of things. One is Kevin is there a way to think about margins in the U.S. and how they progress. Last year margins stepped down the back half due to some of the EOTF impacts. So should we think about it as that pressure eases in the back half? Or do you think about this is the new run rate for U.S. margins? That's question number one. And then two you did take up your G&A. and I understand why this year, is this the right new base level to run G&A at then and it kind of grows from this new I don't know whatever it is $2.2 billion level if that's where it ends up in 2019?\nKevin Ozan: Okay John I'll take both of those. I assume when you say margins we're talking about the company-operated margins on the U.S. side. Well maybe I'll talk about both since I wasn't sure actually. On the company operated side we have a few things going on as you know. Commodity costs were up about 3% in the first quarter. We've said that will be about 2% to 3% for the year. So that should get a little bit better as the year goes on but not easing I'll be say a ton. The other things that we do have as we went into this year we talked about depreciation from the company operated EOTF projects as being about $15 million for the year. So obviously about a quarter of that is going to hit each quarter. And then certainly kind of wage pressures are going to continue to impact us. I'd say the one piece where there is some opportunity going forward is on labor productivity side. There are two things right now that are negatively impacting or have been negatively impacting labor productivity. One being the EOTF projects that we've had. And so as those company-operated projects start winding down that should help some of our productivity. We'll finish all of the company-operated EOTF projects this year so that will be a help as we move forward. And the other is the fact that guest counts are still negative. With negative guest counts that does create a challenge just from the labor productivity side. And so I think if once we're able to turn guest counts positive that will help the labor productivity side also. The other thing I would just note I guess is the company-operated comp sales are a little bit lower than our overall comp sales. And so the 4.5 that we reported for the U.S. based on where we run our company-operated restaurants and the challenging geographies there we didn't achieve that 4.5 on the company operated side. That put a little bit more pressure on the company-operated margins also. The plus of that is I know you guys often looked at company-operated margins as a proxy if you will for how the franchisees are doing. The Franchisees cash flow has been up every month for the last five months through March. So that's a big positive from our franchisees side. And as you know with us running about 95% franchised in the U.S. that's really important for our business. And so that's a big positive. On the franchise margin side there's two things that impacted our franchise margin percentage this quarter. One is the EOTF depreciation. Again we talked about it as we entered the year there's about $100 million of pressure from EOTF depreciation on the franchise margins. So again about a quarter of that hits each quarter. Second is this change in the way we present subleasing income and expenses as a result of the new lease standard. So that impacted U.S. franchise margins by about 130 basis points. It doesn't impact the dollars because the offset to that is revenue. So effectively there's about $20 million or so that we now just gross up revenue and gross up franchise costs but it does reduce that franchise margin percentage if you work through the math. So those are the margins. On the G&A side we talked about and I mentioned in my script obviously two things are impacting G&A this year. The biggest one obviously is the acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Along with that though we've also started investing in some R&D and a few others areas of technology. And the combination of those is what has caused our revision in guidance. The plus is over the last few years we have saved on a gross basis over $600 million. And so we've reduced the amount of kind of maintenance run the day-to-day business G&A and now we're investing a bigger percentage of our G&A in growth based G&A. Moving forward the way we think about G&A is it should be roughly around 2% of systemwide sales or so. So that's the way we think of it on a go-forward basis.\nSteve Easterbrook: And John I just want to thank you for your comments on Jeff. I know many of you on this call would have had time with Jeff. And I was honored to attend the funeral Mass yesterday, for Jeff the occasion was an absolute testament to the memory and the celebration of all that Jeff contributed to life in general and all of our lives. And just as a reflection on just the way that we believe in the uniqueness of the McDonald's family the turnout of owner/operators suppliers and colleagues past and present was just absolutely enormous yesterday and again speaks to the three-legged stool and the impact Jeff had. So thank you for your comment on that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Can you guys speak to a little bit on the delivery side. I'm just looking at how much perhaps was from that $3 billion incremental stemming from the U.S. I'm trying to figure out the percentage that you're doing in delivery now. I know last time you spoke I think it was still coming in around 70% incremental. I'm wondering if that rate has come down a little bit because obviously the comp was very strong. I'm just curious though if it's around that almost 10% level or so or $1 billion of your system sales that perhaps is that the majority of the comp and is the incrementality may be slowing a little bit from that 70% level?\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Matt. Again broader commentary on delivery. We certainly have been finding in these initial first couple of years that the majority of that business is incremental and that the growth and even the year-on-year growth once we got it established is really driven by raising consumer awareness and then just getting more people familiar with the fact that we offer McDelivery in the first place. That incrementality stays strong. It's probably fair to say that we got a quicker leap on delivery in many of our international and mature international markets the likes of UK, Australia, France, Canada and a number of our midsized markets doing some pretty strong numbers as well whether that's Netherlands and Belgium and Spain and Italy. So they're now actually beginning to comp themselves. And not only are we adding new restaurants as the third-party operators expand their networks but we're also beginning to get the year-on-year comp on delivery as well. So we can track that and we're getting some really, really encouraging numbers as we get into that second year. So even though those came out of the traps really, really strong. We're getting comp delivery growth as well as adding new incremental restaurants which is great. It's fair to say we had a slightly slower start in the U.S. So it begun to contribute to the comp as we worked our way through 2018 but not in a particularly significant fashion. But as we've been working with Uber Eats in particular on coverage and trying to get as competitive a deal that both supports the partnership with Uber Eats but also helps the unit economics for our owner/ operators we believe that we're on the verge of unlocking some of that delivery potential more within the U.S. So once we have a good number of restaurants up on delivery in the U. S. the actual guest counts per restaurant per day is still some way behind elsewhere in the world but we're confident that we're going to more rapidly pick up the pace. And I think you can expect to see as we get a critical mass on our system more marketing support behind it, so that we can raise consumer awareness. And certainly the Owner/Operator support will be no noticeable because I know they feel we had a great series of conversation through this quarter and we made it more economically exciting for them to grow the delivery business as well as their traditional business. So we feel we're in a good place. From a $3 billion business to date we still think there is substantial growth opportunity ahead. And I can assure you from a global perspective as well as drive-thru service times being one of the KPIs that I personally have chosen to lead through this year really maximizing this delivery opportunity is another one as well. So we've got a great level focus on it. I'm certainly excited that the U.S. system has got a renewed figured behind it as well.\nMatt DiFrisco: So just to confirm delivery was not the majority of the comp in the US?\nKevin Ozan: Right.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Steve in previous quarters you've talked about how your breakfast business in the U.S. has been a drag on the U.S. comp. And the question is did this daypart show a meaningful improvement as we went into the first quarter? Did it contribute meaningfully to the overall improving trends in the U. S.? So any color on breakfast would be great. And Kevin you talked about the costs on the food basket in the U. S. going from one1 to 2 to 2 to 3. Can you just give us some more color on what drove that change in your expectations?\nSteve Easterbrook: So breakfast was a meaningful contributor. I wouldn't say it was a majority contributor but it was a meaningful positive contribution to like-for-like sales in the quarter which is clearly an encouraging reversal of the previous trends that we'd acknowledged. We're still in a market share fight overall because there are more and more people offering breakfast as a competitive play. But certainly to get back to that growth trajectory is encouraging. The other piece I would say is it really wasn't until the back end of the quarter that the shift from national to local marketing dollars really begun to take effect because that was a decision that was made towards the end of quarter four. So it takes certainly a couple of months to adjust media buying plans marketing plans as well. So I think we feel encouraged. I know that the focus on just the restaurant operation and in particular the drive-thru played a positive role in that introducing new menu item news like the Donut Sticks further supporting the McCaf investments we've made. They all started to contribute to that. So operations menu items and media drive marketing. So I think it was a strong start to the year but we've still got more work to do if we really want to be taking share back at that important daypart for us.\nKevin Ozan: And then Brian related to the change in commodity guidance for the year from 1 to 2 to 2 to 3 the biggest change is due to an expected increase in pork prices a little bit on beef being a little bit higher than what we originally anticipated but most of it is related to pork prices.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great start to the year. My question is on the U. S. comp and the average check growth in the U.S. I think if I heard Kevin correctly the traffic trend didn't change much from Q4 to Q1 which suggests the check growth did accelerate. So I guess the two parts of my question are one do I have that right? And then secondly what drove that? And what do you think the sustainability of that high check growth is in the U.S.? Thanks.\nSteve Easterbrook: I'll have the first stab at that one David. So yes average check growth helps cover up I still think the continuing decline that we recognize in guest counts. So the average check growth was strong. Clearly what we do is drill into that to see where is that growth coming from and it's a combination between product mix shifts and pricing. And what I think is encouraging for us is that the product mix shifts which is how many items in a bundle and also what people are choosing to buy outweighs the pricing impact. You don't want the pricing to get too far away and Kevin may want to talk about our pricing levels. But if you think about the product mix shifts as we grow the delivery business for example the average check is 1.5 to 2 times that of a traditional in-restaurant average check. So that will naturally help to skew business skew the average check higher. As we continue to build customers using the self-order kiosks we tend to get a higher average check because people dwell a little longer at the self-order kiosks. So, And then you've got some of the menu item work we've done in terms of maybe simple things just like adding bacon. The bacon promotion through Big Mac and on our quarter pounders. That helped us grow average check a little as well. So all these activities that we've invested in or that we've built have helped grow the product mix shift overall. So I'm encouraged because you don't want the pricing element to be overly dominant in this year particularly when customers are still feeling the pinch a little bit. But I believe it's a combination of many of the actions that we've taken have actually started to produce a healthy growth in average check and that is what I think we feel confident can been more sustainable.\nKevin Ozan: That covered everything I was going to say. So I don't have anything else to add.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much, Maybe a two-part question on US profitability. The first on the labor inflation. Wondering if you can give any kind of color similar to what you give on commodities in terms of the basket and how much of it is statutory versus market pressure and how are you suggesting the franchisees absorb that which kind of feeds into the other question which is you mentioned franchisee profitability is now up five I believe consecutive months. I'm just wondering if you'd opine on what you think the outlook is for 2019 and whether there's any initiatives you've offered in terms of how to better protect against that labor inflation and the rising COGS you just mentioned. Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. I'll start. There were 20 or 21 states that increased wages I think at the beginning of the year. So those certainly have an impact on wage rates throughout the year. As you know we sat wages for the company operated. Obviously the franchisees they make their own decisions related to wage rates. It depends where in the country as far as what the rates are and how competitive it is with other key competitors around there. So but it is fair to say that I think labor inflation is going to continue to be a challenge. We will continue to look for ways to be as efficient as we can in our restaurant operations to try and help mitigate any of that inflation. But I think that's going to be a continuing challenge for us and the industry. So I guess I'd leave it at that.\nSteve Easterbrook: The other thing I would add that clearly I mean our average starting wage now in company-owned restaurants is now more than $10 an hour. So whilst we don't collect that data from our owner/operators. I think it's reasonable to believe that it would be a similar ish number. And clearly both of those are well above the federal minimum. So as Kevin said, the labor cost is going up certainly far higher than any typical rate of inflation. So it's something we're very mindful of. And yeah, we work with the owner/operators to help each other just to run the business as efficiently and effectively as we can. The best thing we can possibly do is grow the top line. That's the best way of resolving any of these costs increases and just make sure that we don't pass any of the impact of that in a negative way through to the customers. We still want to just staff the restaurants fully and appropriately so we can offer the experience that customers expect from us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask about driving delivery orders to McDonald's app and where are you at in that process? And how is it going and what are you learning? And I was curious about the economics of it. So clearly there's value in getting the customer data and owning that customer more or less versus the marketplace. But is that more of a value customer in the economics are similar? Or are the economics still superior just because you don't have to pay the fees to the marketplace? Thank you.\nSteve Easterbrook: Hi, Nicole. So yes we ultimately really want to be able to offer customers two ways of ordering a meal through McDelivery. One would be directly through the third-party operator which is currently how they do. The other opportunity we deal with is integrate it into our global mobile app. We believe we're making good progress. Obviously there's a fair bit of technology work that has to go on to integrate it. And we believe we're going to be in a position where customers in the U.S. will be able to access it through back end of quarter three this year. And as you say part of what's important in that is that whilst protecting all necessary privacy concerns clearly we will be able to gather more customer data to begin to build up a better understanding of customers behaviors. We've kind of sort of segued into part of what we're trying to do with our technology foundation here overall. If you think about a lot of the investment we and our owner/Operators have made the last two or three years whether it's in developing the app self-order kiosk digital menu boards both in-store and drive-thru we're now beginning to be at the earlier stages of connecting that technology ecosystem. And why that's important is it will allow us to better understand our customers and how they choose to experience McDonald's. And that's where introducing Dynamic Yield for example will provide us with a great opportunity to smooth the experience of customers in the drive-thru regardless of whether we know you are not. But certainly as we start to build on this platform customers who choose to actually share their identity with us. We can be even more useful to pulling up their favorites maybe building some form of loyalty and reward for it. So there's a number of different things that we can do that will further not just modernize the experience but personalize the experience for customers. And certainly with McDelivery being something that we can only ever see grow integrating that into our own technology ecosystem is an important move forward. And we're certainly having really healthy and constructive discussions with Uber about how we can get that done and making sure that we still protect the privacy of customers because we know how important that is for people.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Steve I'm wondering how the promotions in the first quarter in the U.S. in how they did inform your approach going forward? Looks like the bacon event was successful driving some more premium traffic or driving some check. But you also had his negative traffic and that's something you've wanted to avoid or you talked about avoiding. So going forward is the switch back to the 2 for $5 is that an indication that you want to refocus more on traffic? How much does the success of the bacon event give you confidence in premium innovation for the remainder of the year?\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. Good question Jake. I mean this is the continual balancing act or juggling act that we always had at McDonald's and the U.S. is how no different to any other market in the world. I mean how do you create new news to just continue to be top of mind for customers. However not make it so complex as it starts to be a challenge for our teams in the restaurants and therefore inadvertently impact customers. So what we enjoyed about the success of the activity in the U.S. was it was building upon our core menu. So when you can start to use ingredients we already have in the restaurants on menu items that our crew and manager are very familiar with preparing. It really is a seamless activity and it doesn't mean we're always in the state of that. Because I think new menu news every now and then and you probably read the occasional leak about one or two things we have got planned in the U.S. in the coming months. There will be a new menu news for maybe limited-time offers just to create a bit of a buzz and a bit of excitement. And our regular customers like trying something different every now and then but then typically revert back to what they know and what they like. So we're kind of trying to get that balance right between further simplifying the restaurant operation. Again you probably read a couple of things we're doing to help make it easy for our teams to get things right in the restaurants. We're taking a good look at the overnight menu and whether that was overly complex. And then most of our restaurants were already running somewhat more limited menu overnight. For us formalizing that putting some guardrails around it I think is smart and will benefit our customers that time of the day, but would also look at the premium items we have like the signature Crafted and see whether the additional complexity of preparing and some of the unique SKUs that we have in the kitchens. Is it really worthy of that complexity or can we offer a better experience for customers by plussing up our more core and traditional menu. So it's always a juggling act. Don't think that will ever disappear at McDonald's. We've lived with it for 60 odd years. And certainly every single market we look at around the world does the same thing. It's where I would also just like to speak to some of the facilities we have here which actually helps our teams in the their markets. We have the innovation center here which as you know is effectively a very sophisticated test kitchen where we can run our marketing programs through those kitchens and actually almost do a role-play as to what would happen. At the peak hours given a particular type of customer arrival rate in any market in the world and actually see whether the complexity starts to derail the operation. And I can tell you that facility has never been used as widely and fully as it is now. We've probably got 20, 30 markets that will go through there each and every year to validate that operationally we can cope with the exciting marketing and promotional plans that are being built. So we'll continue to stay close to it. And I just feel good about the conversation in the U.S that A lot of the focus is on running the restaurants and just trying to get better day in day out and more consistent. And I think customers will notice the difference\nOperator: As we near the top of the hour, we have time for one more question from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGreg Francfort: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. The first one, I think you guys usually give your gap to competitors in the U.S. And I'm curious what that was during the quarter. And then maybe a bigger picture question. One of your biggest competitors is implementing a plant-based product. And from what we hear it's gone pretty well. And I'm curious how you think about plant-based products fitting into McDonald's offerings and whether or not that would be too much complexity to do that? I'm just curious what are your overall thoughts on that sort of sleeve of products and how it fits into McDonald's?\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. I'll cover the comp gap and then I will let Steve talk about the plant-based protein. You know, I think we've made a decision not to keep talking about the comp gap every quarter. We feel really good about our obviously start to the year in our first quarter. Some of the competition's obviously reported their comps already. Others will do so over the next several days. But we'll talk to our performance and let others talk to the overall industry. So we won't be sharing that core. I will tell you it was certainly positive this quarter. So we're not ceasing it or stopping because there was any issue or because it was negative. It was clearly positive this quarter but we just decided not to give that number every quarter going forward.\nSteve Easterbrook: And on the plant-based question. Yeah our menu teams are clearly paying close attention to it. So when you the key for us is to identify the sustaining consumer trends. So whether if you look at veganism, whether you look at the plant-based protein opportunities what we do have the weigh up and you just mentioned it there is the is there an additional complexity? And if there is that complexity worth it? So we'll stay close to consumer demand. I certainly know our teams are paying close attention and discussing this amongst each other and with some of the options that are out there. So maybe more to come but nothing much to say about it at the moment.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you Steve and Kevin and thank you everyone for joining our call today. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes the McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-01-28 13:44:08", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Investor Conference Call.

Now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike and good morning everyone. At our Investor Update in November, I talked about the start of something new for McDonald's, it was a moment in which we proudly embraced both what we were going to do to write the next chapter of McDonald's growth and how we were going to do it. We shared our new growth strategy accelerating the arches and articulated a clear vision of where we intend to make a difference in a world in need of community and connection. We also acknowledged that between a once in a century pandemic, record economic downturn and profound societal challenges it was the most difficult year McDonald's has seen. While a New Year brings new hope, the issues and uncertainty that emerged last year persist. That reflect on all that has happened even since November, I come back to something Ray Kroc once said, adversity can strengthen you if you have the will to grind it out. Through all the adversity of the last year, we have seen and done important things that reinforce why we are on the right path. We have seen the incredible courage and resilience of our Mac family. We know how to run great restaurants. Our long legacy of execution prowess comes from the talent of our teams, from franchisees to supply chain partners and employees; I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging yet inspiring moment in the long history of this great brand. By making safety and service a priority by implementing the largest and fastest rollout of new safety protocols in McDonald's history and partnering with the Mayo Clinic to review and refine our approach by maintaining supply without interruption, by simplifying our menu, and by continuing to put our customers and people first. All three legs of our stool embodied our values in the best possible way by living them every day. And our customers have noticed global brands scores for consumer confidence in eating at McDonald's have risen significantly since the start of the pandemic. We've seen the love people have for McDonald's and our food. Even while the pandemic forced lockdowns and prevented customers from dining in most of our restaurants, we achieved over 90 billion system wide sales last year. Tens of millions of people every day continue to choose McDonald's for a drive thru contactless delivery, takeaway and curbside pickup, with more and more customers using our app. And that commitment showed despite resurgences of the virus and restrictions on restaurants in the fourth quarter, we continue to see sequential improvement as we delivered our strongest quarter of the year recovering nearly 99% of 2019 global comp sales. Global comp sales for the full year were down 7.7%. Well, there were challenges across markets some of our larger markets achieved positive comp sales for the full year, including the U.S., Japan and Australia. And that was on top of strong momentum coming into 2020. U.S. delivered its sixth consecutive year of positive comps. The average U.S. franchisee restaurant operating cash flow reached an all time high in 2020 up nearly $40,000 over 2019 and up about $100,000 over the last three years. Japan has achieved five consecutive years of positive comp sales, and Australia posted its seventh consecutive year of positive comps. We have seen the ability that McDonald's has to survive hard times, and to do so while consistently investing to support both the short and long-term. One thing I admire most about our system is that no matter how difficult times get, we never stopped thinking about what's next. The impacts of COVID on our industry have been significant. It's been tough. We were sober and realistic from early on, while remaining committed to helping every operator and partner survive this crisis. We took prudent, quick action designed to prevent not a single owner operator from failing due to the pandemic, why we bolstered our cash position early in the year to provide nearly $1 billion in financial liquidity to support franchisees. We also maintained our view on the long-term as we invested $1.6 billion of CapEx to open nearly 1,000 new restaurants globally, and modernize another 900 in the U.S., provided $200 million in incremental marketing support to accelerate the recovery. And together with our franchisees, we invested over $1 billion in technology and digital initiatives, all of which will help drive our next chapter of growth. We've also seen our commitment to feed and foster communities take on new meaning this past year, there are so many incredible stories about how the McDonald's system has stepped up to be there for our neighbors and communities this past year, to name a few. Together with our franchisees, we provided more than 12 million Thank You Meals to first responders and healthcare workers in the U.S. We donated extra food within our supply chain to communities in need around the world gave millions of surgical masks to communities to help protect first responders. And in November, we announced our commitment to donate $100 million over five years to help families with sick children through Ronald McDonald House Charities. We were on the ground, working to help local communities solve problems, while also looking for ways to use our size and scale to make an even bigger impact. It was an important reminder that brands like ours can help provide stability and even hope during difficult times. Today, brands are working through many societal issues that directly impact our businesses and the economy. And we have a unique role to play in ensuring these issues get addressed. That's true of COVID. Hard to imagine that was just a year ago last week that the first case of the Corona virus was confirmed in the U.S. Even while we celebrate a vaccine created in record time we know that COVID is at its worst right now in many parts of the world, that so many of the communities we serve are experiencing record high infection rates. We all must play a role as part of the solution. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead for us as individuals and for this industry. Neither may change for some time, but look forward to joining with other business leaders and working with the Biden administration and congressional leadership as we have with every U.S. President throughout our 66 year history to address the challenges the country faces. We work to hopefully return to some version of normal, the needs of our customers have changed, dining in less and taking out more, visiting less in the morning and much more for lunch and dinner and interacting with other people and brands less in person and more through digital. Just as the investment in choices we've made have driven broad based strength, accelerating the arches will enable us to grow even more sustainably with a bottom up approach to our growth pillars. Our MCD; M stands for maximizing our marketing. So our significant marketing investment remains a true growth driver. We\u2019re improving creative effectiveness and leaning into social and digital to drive customer engagement. Teams remain focused on the right balance of sales activation with brand building as we work to optimize marketing returns. We made an immediate impression in the closing weeks of 2020 with the launch of our Serving Here campaign in the U.S., celebrating the myriad ways we feed and foster communities. At the same time, many markets drove performance in the fourth quarter with successful sales building promotions like 30 deals in 30 days in Australia and monopoly in Australia, France and Canada, featuring customers\u2019 core favorites. They are great examples of using our marketing muscle to drive sales without adding complexity to our kitchens. C stands for our commitment to the core menu. Our delicious core is something people rely on it and return to again and again. Our core classics comprise roughly 70% of our food sales across our top market. They drive growth and profitability and we saw that this past year. Developing a reputation for great chicken represent one of our highest ambition. That's why markets are activating multi tiered strategy and holistic approaches that integrate great products, strong and sustained marketing and operations excellence. Rebuilding on the strength of core equities like Chicken McNuggets, and McChicken sandwiches, which have seen significant growth as we continue to focus on improving our large chicken sandwich offerings around the world. The U.S., we are excited about the return of spicy Chicken McNuggets and the launch of the new crispy chicken sandwich at the end of February. Markets are also making our delicious and popular 100% all-beef burgers even better, with improved cooking procedures and new buns. Russia was the latest major market to roll out these changes in Q4, driving meaningful lists in hamburger sold. We've also continued to create menu excitement that keeps customers engaged by bringing back limited time promotions like Maghrib and introducing new items like our bakery line in the U.S. and the premium mix baguette and signature recipe in France. What's important is that our approach to our menu is thoughtful and judicious. We've seen significant benefits with our streamlined menus and reduced complexity. New items must earn their place on the menu. Lastly, D stands for doubling down on digital delivery and drive-thru. They were the difference maker when the pandemic hit and are at the heart of our combined efforts to create a faster, easier better customer experience. Digital sales exceeded 10 billion; we are nearly 20% of system wide sales in 2020 across our top six markets. We are moving aggressively to bring My McDonald's with mobile ordering payments, delivery, rewards and fun promotions like digital calendars to our customers as soon as possible. We are on track to have elements of Buy McDonald's across our top six markets by the end of 2021. Featuring loyalty programs in several of those markets, including a U.S. loyalty launch later in 2021. We have big ambitions. We have already shown we know how to meet big goals as we've proven with delivery. The past four years McDonald's has expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery, the nearly 30,000 and COVID has underscored how meaningful our efforts have been to our customers. Many markets including Australia, Canada, and the U.S. have doubled their delivery sales mix over the past year. We continue to build out our delivery advantage much like we are expanding our competitive advantage on drive-thru. With over 25,000 drive-thrus around the world, we've made smart investments to bolster foundational elements like staffing, positioning and order assembly. We've reduced service times each of the past two years, even as a greater percentage of customers went through our drive-thrus during 2020. Well, each pillar will further extend our leadership. What's especially powerful is the exponential impact when all three pillars come together. Famous orders platform in the U.S. is a prime example. The fourth quarter we featured favorite menu items of Latin music icon J Balvin and classic holiday characters including Santa Claus and the Grinch. With exclusive deals on our app, customers rediscovered iconic core menu items like Big Macs and Egg McMuffins and tried new items like cinnamon rolls. And we drove digital adoption including significant lifts, nap registrations and use. That's our sweet spot. That's how MC and D come together to drive demand, sales and growth without creating additional complexity. Our ability to navigate the past year would not have been possible without the incredible commitment of our franchisees, our supply chain and agency partners and our employees who have continued to focus and execute during this extraordinary past year. When I think about everything our restaurant teams around the world have done to provide an essential service at the front lines, serving our customers safely every step of the way. I can't help to believe that this amazing system is proving every day. This isn't just a job to them, and to us, it's something bigger. It's our chance to make a difference for our customers and our communities. I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our financial results. Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. Chris talked a bit about our full year results. So let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter. Global comparable sales were down 1.3% in Q4. Comp sales were positive in October, as I mentioned on our Q3 call that they return negative in November and December as a result of the widespread resurgences and the return of government restrictions, particularly across the international operated markets. In the U.S. comp sales increased 5.5% for the quarter, ending the year with six consecutive months of positive comps. Sales grew in all major day parts including breakfast, and this is on top of prior growth across these day parts. Our strategic investments including incremental marketing spend, fueled our momentum with strong national promotions, like McRib buy one get one for $1, our new bakery line and two separate offerings of famous orders. Dinner continued to be our leading day part with strong sales of core items as customers keep coming back for familiar favorites. The IOM segment comp sales were down 7.4% in Q4, and while performance varied across the countries, nearly all of our major markets grew traffic share. Strong positive comps in Australia in the U.K. were more than offset by negative double-digit comps in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Beginning at the end of October, additional government restrictions went into effect across many of our markets, including limited sales channels, reduced operating hours and dining room closures. Australia benefited from strong menu and marketing news in the quarter, including the successful launch of a new chicken line with McSpicy at its center. Another example of great ideas and products traveling across our markets, as McSpicy has been a customer favorite in China and several other markets in Asia for a while. Since the start of the pandemic, Australia has also doubled their delivery sales. The U.K. has achieved comp sales growth every month since August despite increased restrictions reintroduced in early November. The quarter benefited from a focus on core menu, as well as phenomenal growth and delivery. And finally, comp sales in the international developmental license segment were down 3.6% for the quarter, reflecting significant improvement for most markets over Q3. Japan once again delivered strong positive comp sales for the quarter and for the year as Chris mentioned. The market is meeting customers changing needs rolling delivery and mobile ordering along with running successful LTO promotions, all while further strengthening trust in our brand. And in China, results have improved quarter-over-quarter since Q1. Recovery continued on a steady pace with a marketing plan focused on delivery and digital along with new chicken offerings. And despite the challenging year, nearly 500 new restaurants were opened across the market in 2020. Turning to January trends, in the U.S. sales comps continue to be strong and are expected to be up high single-digits with continued growth across all day parts and assisted by consumers receiving government stimulus checks. IOM comp sales are projected to be down low double-digits given the government restrictions that remain in place in most markets. Continued momentum in Australia is being more than offset by double-digit negative comps in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. And we expect this trend to likely continue until dine-in resumes. Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was a $1 70 after excluding gains on the sale of an additional 3% of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. While global restaurant margins were down as a result of the pressure on sales, the U.S. grew both franchised and company operated margins up over $70 million for the quarter. Consistent with the guidance we gave in our third quarter remarks, G&A increases for Q4 were primarily driven by some one-time investments we made in renewed brand activity, including the launch of our Serving Here campaign, and our commitment to donate $100 million to Ronald McDonald House Charities, as Chris mentioned earlier. Turning to our outlook for 2021. As Chris talked about, there's still a lot of uncertainty both today and as we look ahead. We're confident in our ability to manage through this uncertainty, and that are accelerating the arches strategy will continue to drive growth in the business. We expect 2021 system wide sales growth of low double-digits in constant currencies versus 2020, with new unit expansion contributing about 1%. This reiterates the mid single-digit growth rate of 2019 that we mentioned in November. We ultimately measure overall financial efficiency by our operating margin, as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of our operating performance. We expect our operating margin percent to be in the low to mid 40s for 2021. In the U.S., we expect higher depreciation expense of about $60 million versus 2020 in franchise margins related to our modernization efforts. Depreciation will continue to be a P&L headwind for the next few years, even though we'll have no impact on future cash flows. In the IOM segment, while we expect improvement in our company operating margin percent over the course of the year, we don't expect to get back to pre-COVID levels in 2021 as a result of near-term sales and cost pressures. Turning to G&A, as we become more efficient with G&A required to run the business, we're able to make strategic investments in areas like digital and technology to drive growth. Looking ahead, we expect 2021 G&A to decrease about 2% to 4% in constant currencies over 2020, which reiterate our expectation that G&A will be about 2.3% of system wide sales. Looking at other operating income and expense, we expect our equity pickup to be slightly higher for 2021 due to improved results versus 2020 partially offset by a reduced ownership in Japan. Gains on restaurant sales last year were suppressed due to COVID that we expect gains this year to be about double that of 2020. And finally, in 2020, we had some one-time items included in the asset dispositions line related to store closings and bad debts. For 2021, we expect that line to get back to a more normal level of expense of roughly $100 million. We're projecting our 2021 effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%. And finally, turning to FX based on current exchange rates, foreign currency translation would benefit EPS by about $0.06 to $0.08 in the first quarter, and $0.27 to $0.29 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move throughout the year. Moving the capital expenditures, as we indicated in November, we expect to spend roughly $2.3 billion of capital in 2021. New restaurant development is an important driver of our growth, as we see significant expansion opportunity, especially in the IOM segment. These markets have driven strong growth over the past several years, and deliver strong returns on new restaurants. This year, we plan to open over 1,300 new restaurants globally of the 2.3 billion of capital we will spend roughly half of that to open nearly 500 restaurants in the U.S. and IOM segments. The remaining 800 plus new restaurant openings are across the ideal markets including nearly 500 in China. As a reminder, our strategic partners in these markets provide the capital for restaurant openings. The remaining half of CapEx spend will go towards reinvestment back into our U.S. and IOM restaurants, including about 500 million to modernize approximately 1,200 restaurants in the U.S. We're nearing completion of our U.S. modernization efforts, and expect over 90% of projects to be complete by the end of the year. And finally, I want to conclude with our free cash flow profile. With the improvements made to our business operating model over the last several years, and the consistent strength of our global business our free cash flow grew significantly through 2019. In 2020, even with significant disruption, we generated free cash flow of over $4.5 billion and free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow, was nearly 100%. In 2021, we expect to convert more than 90% of our net earnings to free cash flow, and to generate free cash flow near 2019 levels are about $5.5 billion to $6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. First investing in the business to drive growth, this includes both capital expenditures, as well as investments in technology and digital. Second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, most of our remaining free cash flow for 2021 will go towards paying down debt to get back to pre-COVID leverage ratios by the end of the year. As we start the New Year, I'm confident that the plans we have in place will position us to continue to deliver sustained, long-term profitable growth for our system and shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close.\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, Kevin. Despite the uncertainties we continue to face, one thing is clear. McDonald's is well positioned to emerge from this moment with competitive strength. And we're confident we can keep capturing market share as we look to the future. We're confident because we were growing share in most markets before COVID. We're confident because we've continued growing market share during COVID. And we're especially confident because we've gained important insights which will bolster the strategic vision we set with accelerating the arches. This clarity of purpose and strategy is the reason that in October, we increased our annual dividend to shareholders. Not only did it mark 40 plus consecutive years of increases, it reinforced to our shareholders are confident in the long-term strategy. Also, the reason we continue directing investments where they make the most strategic sense and build on our strengths. We will uphold McDonald's commitment and legacy as a responsible and reliable choice for trusted delicious food. And will do so while feeding and fostering community and continuing to create delicious, feel good moments for everyone. This is the mission that has always and will always animate our work. But when it comes to our customers, our employees, our franchisees and our suppliers it doesn't just matter what we do, it matters how we do it. And now we'll begin Q&A.\nOperator: All right, thank you. [Operator instructions] I ask that you limit yourself to one question and reenter the queue if you have another. Our first question to get started is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Chris and Kevin, can you talk a little bit more about the IOM markets and the tactics you're using to drive sales? I understand that dine in is more important. There's less drive through structurally but what are you doing to help sort of bridge this gap to get to easier comparisons in the reopening? Is this a market for example, you might try launching the My McDonald's rewards earlier, can you talk about maybe the role of delivery and what you're doing to delivery some things that can help obviously bridge this gap when you've got such restrictions in place?\nChris Kempczinski: John this is Chris. Thanks for the question. And in the IOM market, as you know it is -- those markets tend to be more of a dine-in business. And so, the biggest thing that we're doing with many of these markets having dine-in close is we are trying to do as much as we can to drive our drive-thru delivery our digital businesses and we're having good success with that. Some of it though, is frankly limited because in many markets, the risk -- our operating hour restrictions 6 P.M. 8 P.M., et cetera. So I think you know, part of what we are trying to do is with our franchisees, so long as we are dealing with government restrictions around what you can open, how long you can be open. It's about supporting the franchisees, as we said in the opening remarks here, making sure that all of our franchisees have the liquidity that they need to get through it. As you come through, though, I think the plan that we laid out, which is focused on driving core menu in the 3Ds, that's the way that we really come out of this, I think in a very strong position. And we've seen as we've gone through this, one of the things for us, we've discovered capacity that we didn't even realize we've had. We think in the last year, we've moved something like 300 million additional cars through our drive-thrus. And you\u2019d asked me a few years ago, I was thinking that we were pretty, pretty maxed out on drive-thru. So I think our guys are set up well to get after this. But as we're continuing to deal with some of these short-term restrictions, it is challenging.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'd add, John is, as Chris mentioned, obviously, we're seeing both digital and delivery, growing significantly in those IOM markets in the U.K., for example, over 20% of their sales in Q4 were delivery sales. So we are seeing some significant growth both in delivery and digital. The other thing I would point out is this is nothing structural, this is a temporary issue. And the reason I think we're confident in saying that is, if we look back at even as recently as October, we were relatively flat in IOM in October. But as the new restrictions come back, that's when we see kind of comps going down again. So as soon as the markets start opening up again and easing restrictions, I think we're pretty confident customers come back pretty quickly and we\u2019ll be set up well.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for the question and good morning. I was wondering how you think fast food chains like yourself might fare as the world gets through the vaccine recovery phase. And clearly there's been a high demand for contact list and whole meal solutions during the pandemic, as evidenced by the increased average check. But Australia, which seems to be a strong performer as of late might be one area where it seems like consumers are closer to normal relative to the world. So if you could speak to how the traffic ticket dynamics have evolved in that country perhaps that might give us some clues about how you might perform in some other countries post vaccine rollout? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Eric. In Australia, as you note, it has been one of the few markets in the world that has -- I would say relatively unscathed by Corona virus, as they've done a very nice job of containing the virus. And that market is performing very strongly at our franchisees in Australia are going to have record cash flow in 2020. The businesses is doing high single-digit performance. So I think it is for us a good indication of what the post-COVID opportunity for us can look like. I think what we are expecting, though, is and what we've seen is we've gone through COVID. And then resurgence of COVID recovery is that channels like digital, like delivery like drive-thru, they do remain elevated. We think that that is going to be kind of one of the more enduring parts of it. It doesn't mean that there still isn't going to be a sizable dine-in business. But I think the takeaway business is going to remain elevated post-COVID, including delivery with that. And those channels when you look at whether its delivery or digital drive-thru those tend to be higher order sizes. And so as the mix moves to that I think this idea of elevated check, we're expecting that that's going to continue, albeit not at the levels that you're seeing now. But I think it just there's going to be a channel mix shift that is going to continue to give benefit to average check going forward is our expectation.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning, Chris, there's been a lot of media reports about friction between the franchisees in the U.S. and the company. And I was wondering if you could just comment on the current situation and your plan to resolve some of that conflict as you think about the short-term or near-term?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Thanks, David. Well, as you know, I know the U.S. market well having run that for three years, and I'd say there are a few things that I just learned during my time in the U.S. The first is, we have 2,000 owner operators in the U.S. And it is very difficult to generalize sort of what is the overall sentiment in that market, you have 2,000 CEOs and Presidents have their own businesses with a lot of different opinions and perspectives. So I would just caution to make any generalizations about the market. The other thing that I would say is, the business is a very decentralized, federated type of model, all the action happens at the restaurant level. And at the restaurant level, the U.S. interaction between the company and franchisees remains strong. And I think the evidence of that is just the operating performance that you're seeing out of our restaurants in the U.S. As we're putting up, pretty strong comps, which if you look at it on a two year stack basis, it was I think a 10.1 in Q4, on a two year stack. So the business is performing, I think at a very high level, we're seeing service times improve, but there is absolutely noise. And there absolutely is -- or some disagreements that happen right now between the national operator leadership and our U.S. team. I dealt with those when I was in the U.S., they flare up from time-to-time. We're certainly in one of those moments now. But I'm confident that Joe Erlinger and the U.S. team along with [Mark Salibre] [ph], who leads the operator group at the national level, we always find our way to work through these and I fully expect that that will be the case in the U.S.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great, thanks for the question. Chris. you've outlined I think a bunch of initiatives in the U.S. and marketing plans and overall strategy for the U.S. this year, just wondering kind of given the strong recent momentum, the U.S. has seen I wondering if you could kind of just help frame some of those initiatives for the year that you kind of see as most impactful, I'm sure, it's sort of a collective effort. But in your mind, what's kind of the most impactful this year to help drive sales to help drive continued market share gains? Is it the marketing plans? Is it some of the new products that you've highlighted aspects of the 3Ds? Just hoping you could kind of contextualize some of that prospects?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure, well, I'll go through kind of the MCD framework, I think we've got to have great marketing, the great marketing has to come to life on chicken and the loyalty launch that's where all three of those come together. And our expectation is that that chicken and loyalty, not just for 2021, but frankly, for a longer term perspective, those are probably two of the most important things we need to get done in a high quality manner in 2021, both for that year's performance or for this year's performance, but also setting us up for the longer term.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks, another question on the IOM. Just wondering how you're thinking about those international operating markets after the vaccine. These markets had most of their sales pre-COVID from on premise ordering and some are even city center locations perhaps more than the U.S. where you have a lot of suburban drive-thru. So obviously more painful today, but I wonder if you're thinking that market share gains could be even greater because your competition, which is often local lacks McDonald's unit economics and the drive-thrus that you have that are obviously helping your profitability during the pandemic. So could you talk about the outlook for market share gains and if there's any sort of difference in the recovery that you perceive in these markets broadly than what we would expect in the U.S.? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Thanks, David. I\u2019ll take a shot at it and Chris can certainly chime in. As you mentioned, certainly our percentage of restaurants with drive-thru in the international operated markets is a little bit less than what we have in the U.S. In Australia and Canada, it's more around 80%, 90%, but in France, Germany, U.K., it's roughly two-thirds of their restaurants or so that have drive-thrus. So the percent of sales that run through the drive-thru is pre-COVID in those international operated markets was less. We're certainly seeing during the pandemic, a higher percentage of sales run through the drive-thru, as well as elevated digital and delivery sales. But I think, to your point, I think we believe we're well set up post pandemic, because while the percentage of drive-thrus is less than the U.S., it's substantially higher than just about any competitor in most of those markets. And so, the fact that we're well set up with drive-thrus will continue to open up more drive-thrus. To your point, there are some city center tourist travel locations, right now that are kind of getting hit harder than certainly most of our U.S. restaurants because of the pandemic. But there's nothing structural in the business that gives us concern that once the market start opening up, post pandemic, we feel like we should be in good shape to be able to pick up market share. There are still a substantial number of restaurants in many of those markets that are closed, the unknown -- not McDonald's restaurants, I'm just saying in the industry. The unknown certainly is how many of those are temporary versus what's permanent. But we think we're pretty well set up to be able to continue gaining market share, which we have done both in 2019 and in 2020, during the pandemic in those IOM markets to keep gaining market share.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower: Thanks for taking the question. Just first clarification on the question. Kevin, on the IOM margin, I just want to make sure I understand that guidance you had talked about I think you'd said not getting back to pre-COVID levels in 2021. I assume you're speaking about the full year, not just on a quarterly basis. But a clarification, that would be great. And then secondarily, on the marketing side, you had the 200 million or so of incremental spend in 2020 across the U.S. and the IOM? How should we think about the company lapping this spend in 2021 meaning, are you anticipating that franchisee sales recovery will fill the void and therefore your presence and dollar spend will be similar year-over-year? Yes, if you could just add a little bit color there. That would be great.\nChris Kempczinski: I will start with the IOM margins. So, Jon, to your point, what I talked about is, yes, annually, I don't expect yet in 2021, that the IOM segment would get back to the kind of 20% margins that we've all been used to pre pandemic. Again, there's nothing structural that prevents that from happening, longer term. But we know for at least in the first quarter, certainly, margins are certainly depressed a little bit still because of the sales and the restrictions going on. So we do think as the year progresses, margins will improve over where they were in 2020, but likely not get back for the full year to that 20% kind of level that we were used to prior to the pandemic.\nKevin Ozan: And then on the marketing question, I'll start maybe just with the math, which is, as you know, we do fund marketing as a percent of revenue. And so certainly as the business recovers, and grows, we think at a pretty nice clip in 2021, that there will be a benefit from an investment size that we can go do in marketing, but it's not going to be to the level of $200 million. I think the bigger thing that I think about and the bigger benefit is this is a momentum business. And when you have momentum in the business, everything seems to work better including on your marketing side. So our expectation part of why we put the 200 million in 2020, was to make sure that we could generate some strong momentum coming out of this. And when you've got that momentum, you get an outsized effect from what would be even a normalized marketing level. So that's the bet that we're making and why we're confident on the back half of the year.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChris Carril: Hi, good morning. And thanks for all the detail provided so far and appreciate the detail on the most recent trends in January. I did want to ask about the competitive environment in the U.S. And clearly a lot has been made around the growing competition around chicken. But there also appears to be more of a focus. I'm curious to hear your perspective on just broader industry competitive dynamics, and in particular thoughts on breakfast competition and share gain opportunities there? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, thanks, Chris. And it is a competitive market in the U.S. probably one of the most competitive markets, if not the most competitive market in the world. Back in November, when we had our Investor Day, part of the M within MCD was that we needed to make sure we had a strong focus on affordability. And you're seeing just as we've entered into 2021, you've seen some of the value deals that are out there from our competitors. We've also had some programs that that I think have performed well for us. And that's going to be a trend that continues all through 2021. Our expectation is that you're absolutely going to need to remain competitive on value. I think we've been able to back to the momentum point. We've been able to put ourselves through the investments we've made in modernizing our state, upgrading our brand attributes, I think we're in a better position than we were maybe four or five years ago in terms of just the consumer demand for our brands. So I think that for us, gives me confidence that you know, this isn't going to be something that gets that we're going to have to chase down the rabbit hole, so to speak. On your question about breakfast, our breakfast business is performing well. In Q4, our breakfast business grew. We saw strong performance out of the bakery line. So our expectation is, going forward that breakfast the day part, we've been pleased with how we weathered through 2020 on that, even with the introduction of one of our competitors, didn't have a significant impact on our breakfast business. And as we looked to 2021, our expectation were set up that breakfast for us should be a good performing day part as people get back to hopefully returning to work and kind of a more regular routine, which certainly benefits traffic in the morning.\nMike Cieplak:  Our next question is from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Hi, thank you very much. A little bit of a follow up on the last question, but maybe a different, a little bit of a different spin. I wondering if you could talk about the state of the consumer in the U.S. and how you're seeing things play out from that perspective, obviously, given some stimulus benefits, but still high unemployment and challenges related to COVID. And maybe, to follow up on that point, how you're thinking about the balance of value and premium offerings and LTOs throughout 2021? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: So thanks, Jared. I think with the state of the consumer, we do consumer tracking, as you would expect on a monthly basis. And what we're seeing right now is that concern for economic uncertainty is by far the single biggest concern that exists with our consumers, which again, gets back to why we think and affordability is going to be one of the things that that all of us need to stay focused on in a prudent way, in 2021. Because of the level of stimulus, certainly it is helping right now in the short-term. I think the industry were a beneficiary of that. But the stimulus is going to roll-off and I don't think that we yet fully understand or have visibility to as the stimulus rolls-off sort of what is the underlying health of the consumer, many people have talked about a case shape recovery, the divergence between the stock market and the rest of the \u201creal economy\u201d. I think that's real. So we are watching closely, what happens with the consumer, but we think this concern about the economy concern about people's sort of financial health, that that is going to be something that that persists through the balance of 2021. Is there another part to that?\nKevin Ozan: I think it was just the concept of balancing value premium and LTOs, which it is a constant focus for us and we need to balance all of those three LTOs value in premium. I think you'll see that continuing both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., because that is our normal. We've got to make sure that we have offerings for all consumers depending on what they kind of the change they've got in their pocket at any given time. The one thing I guess I would just say on that, if you go to the C&R framework, the core menu is the primary growth driver for us in 2021. And we think for the next several years. So, while there will be some LTO activity, I think all markets, U.S. and our IOM markets in particular, have raised the bar in terms of what an LTO has to do to earn its way onto the menu. So I think you might see, versus maybe what we had pre pandemic levels a little bit more moderate pace of LTOs because of this focus on core menu.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I wanted to follow up on I guess, the supply question in IOM, but maybe talk about it, specifically by country, many of us have, travel to these countries with you, over the years, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, U.K., so we, do have a fine appreciation of -- as you define the informal eating out market that you directly compete against, in many -- of these areas, and I guess many of the high streets, if you will, in particular. So, I mean, it's through the market intelligence that you have, and I think, you define that market uniquely in terms of using the words IEO, informal eating out. How much capacity do you think, and again, this is really we are looking for your opinion, it's not necessarily a fact, but how much of that capacity do you think, has come out permanently? And, I asked this question also in the context of government assistance to restaurants or so different around the world, certainly different than U.S. that maybe give a certain amount of survivability, or I guess, in some cases on survivability relative to what's happened, for example, through PPP here?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I'll take a shot. And then again, Chris can always add-in. John, as you know and you mentioned, obviously each country is a little different, both in terms of demographic, consumer demographics, as well as competitive environment. I think -- so things like high streets in the U.K., I think right now is a challenge certainly much broader than our business. But there's a question of when and even if the high street in the U.K. completely returns to kind of pre pandemic levels. I think, in general, as I mentioned, right now, there's, there's a lot of outlets closed in many of the markets. The unknown is how many of those are temporary versus permanent. I do think certainly, in many of those countries, where someone has one, maybe two outlets, that's a bigger challenge. And I don't think we'd be surprised to see several of those outlets permanently closed. We're seeing that in several of the countries right now, where it looks like many of those outlets will not be returning. So that I think overall supply in general will shrink a little bit, which certainly is an opportunity for us to continue gaining market share. That's our expectation. That's what we're going after. And I think we believe that we're well positioned to gain a lot of that share.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. Just on the new crispy chicken sandwiches coming next month. Can you talk about the learnings from test markets, particularly, looking to what you observed in sales, even its qualitative? And also just operationally comparing it three years ago when half the grill was launched, where the performance was a bit subdued because of the longer than expected service times? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure, well, we did to have it in test market and we were encouraged. That's why we're rolling it out. I think our focus in test was much more on the operation side than having it be sort of an advertised type of test. So for us, it was about just getting the operation work through and confident for us and being able to deliver it in a high quality way. We feel good about that. I know Morgan Flatley in the U.S. marketing team feel good about the campaign that we have, so and franchisees are excited about it. So we are optimistic as we head into February, despite it was referenced earlier, a lot of activity in this space, but we think we're prepared well to generate demand from consumers on this one and then deliver on that as consumers come into our restaurant.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Just a question on the labor side of things. And I guess it's more so for franchisees, but you mentioned working closely with the government on different initiatives, seems like there's a lot of opposing forces, at least for franchisees, where you have the national minimum wage potentially going up. But on the subset unemployment high, which would historically imply ample labor. So maybe with that, as kind of a backdrop would love your outlook on labor costs, and perhaps labor availability? And whether you think the franchisees can offset that pressure, whether it's through cost savings, technology, pricing, how are those conversations going with franchisees regarding dealing with upcoming ongoing labor cost pressures? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Jeff. I think the discussion about the minimum wage, and what that means in terms of cost of labor. And while it's picked up with the change in the administration, at the federal level, I would say that it's been going on at the state level for the last several years, and you've seen a number of states, I forget, if it's 24, 25 states have passed some degree of minimum wage legislation. Florida was the most recent one in this past election, where I think they've introduced a $15 an hour a glide path to a $15 an hour. So we've -- as this has been rolling into the states, we have seen and developed quite a bit of experience with how this works out. And the positive for us has been, so long as it's done in a staged way and so long as it is done equitably across the entire market without sort of any carve outs or special exemptions for people, then we do just fine. And we're able to balance between judicious pricing on the menu, as well as just thinking about productivity savings that we can manage through this. I will give you another example that gives us confidence there was a significant increase in the minimum wage that was passed in Canada a couple years back. And that team working with the franchisees did a spectacular job of working that through -- onto the menu through pricing, through productivity. So I think, our view is the minimum wage is most likely going to be increasing whether that's federally or at the state level as I referenced, and so long as it's done, like I said, in a staged way and in a way that is equitable for everybody. McDonald will do just fine through that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thanks, I believe back in June, you talked about drive-thru service times improving in the U.S. by about 25 seconds to the pandemic, assuming that 25 seconds still hold? To what extent do you attribute that to the simplified menu versus other changes? And how is the dynamic about those checks and larger orders impacting drive-thru time? And then just for 2021, do you see any other opportunities for further improvement? That is a broader roll-out of franchise?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I can give a shot to that, Lauren. So yes, we've continued both in 2019, as you mentioned, but as well in 2020. Overall we reduced drive-thru times by roughly 30 seconds over the past two years in our major markets. And I think that's a combination of a few things. One is menu simplification and the more limited menu that that you indicate, but also just a big focus on operations around the world, which includes some non-sexy stuff like staffing and positioning of our crew, some certain technology that we put in the restaurants to help the crew monitor the times. And so there's just some basic kind of operating the restaurants efficiently that goes along with the right menu and menu boards. And so, there continues to be a big focus on drive-thru operations, especially because we've seen drive-thru, continue to be a bigger percentage of our business. So there's still opportunity to continue reducing those service times. So I wouldn't say that we are now at kind of the top level of what we can achieve. There's still a big focus around the company on continuing to improve those service times.\nMike Cieplak: Okay, we have time for one more question from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGregory Francfort: Thanks for that. Can you maybe talk a little bit about score level margins in the U.S. and where you them going kind of over the next few years and the pandemic has helped kind of push that up quite a bit. And I'm wondering how much those gains you think you can hold on from an efficiency standpoint? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: thanks, Greg. Certainly in the U.S., we've seen the last couple of quarters that store level margins are up. I think that's a combination of a few things. We've talked about higher average check, being larger group size orders, et cetera. Again, I think as Chris mentioned, some of that will stick maybe not to the level that we are today. So I think we do see some of the U.S. margins probably moderating over the next year. Conversely, in the IOM, I think they've been hit harder at store level margins because they haven't had the sales levels that we need in order to maintain high margins. So I think IOM over time will get back to where they were pre pandemic, U.S. is probably a little bit higher in the last couple of quarters than we should expect ongoing for 2021 at least.\nMike Cieplak: Thank you, Chris and Kevin, and thank you all for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-11-09 10:05:10", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald\u2019s Third Quarter 2020 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are any reconciliations of non-GAAP measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast, and a replay of this call will be available on our website. We have a couple of updates that we\u2019re providing today. We\u2019ll cover our third quarter 2020 earnings release on this call. And with me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Please note that Kevin\u2019s commentary will be limited to prepared remarks as we\u2019ll follow this call with a virtual investor update we're beginning at 8:30 a.m. Central Standard Time. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski, will be joined by Kevin and members of our leadership team to provide an update on our strategic priorities followed by a Q&A session. Registration details can be found on the Investor Events section of our website. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Since March, we\u2019ve reminded everyone that we entered the pandemic from a position of strength with unique advantages that helped ensure our success is built to last. This has only become more evident as we look at the significant progress our markets around the world made in the third quarter. Global comparable sales improved sequentially from Q2 and throughout Q3, with sales down 2.2%, including month-over-month improvement across all segments. Our success comes from leveraging our competitive advantages, the trust our customers have in our brand; our operational strength, including our significant drive-thru presence and delivery capabilities; and the unwavering commitment across our system, all grounded in an intense focus on the safety of our customers and crew. We\u2019re pleased with our recovery to date, but we also understand there inevitably will be more starts and stops with virus resurgences. We\u2019re already seeing this in many markets in all parts of the world. As a reminder, we started the third quarter with nearly all of our global restaurants open for business, and they remain open today. However, with the resurgences I mentioned, there are numerous instances of government restrictions on operating hours, limited dining capacity in most countries, and in some cases mandated dining room closures. Around the world, comp sales continued to be driven by check growth from larger orders. This is particularly true with our drive-thru business, which continues to be one of our biggest areas of strength. In most markets, our drive-thru sales percentage peaked during the second quarter and remains elevated when compared to historical norms. This safe and convenient service channel has been especially appealing to customers during the pandemic. Similarly, delivery sales have also increased meaningfully across substantially all of our major markets. We provided an update on our third quarter comp sales in early October. I\u2019d like to take time now to walk through some of the details for the quarter, followed by a look at October sales trends. Starting with the U.S., comparable sales were up 4.6% with positive comps in each month of the quarter, including low double digits in September, marking our highest monthly comp in nearly a decade. Sales comps were also positive across all dayparts for the month of September with continued strength at dinner. As we mentioned on our Q2 call, we had a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020 to further accelerate recovery. The U.S. began to leverage this marketing investment in a big way to launch our Famous Orders platform during a pivotal time when consumers were looking for reasons to eat out again. The platform was launched with two multicultural brand advocates, first, the Travis Scott meal in September, and building on that success, our second with J Balvin, and there are more to come. The success of this platform demonstrates how powerful it can be when our brand, digital engagement and affordability are all working together. The U.S. also introduced a twist on a familiar favorite, the Chicken McNuggets. For the first time since the debut of the Chicken McNuggets in 1983, we built on the success seen in many other markets around the world by introducing a spicy flavor profile to a core menu item, all while keeping it simple in our kitchens. And at the end of October, we introduced a new McCaf\u00e9 Bakery line to our menu. Customers can enjoy an apple fritter, blueberry muffin, or a cinnamon roll for breakfast or an afternoon snack with our McCaf\u00e9 Coffee. As a reminder, virtually all restaurants in the U.S. have remained open throughout the pandemic. And today, we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we\u2019re taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. Moving to our International Operated Markets segment. Comp sales were down 4.4% in Q3, with significant improvement over our Q2 comps of negative 41%. Performance varied across markets as negative comp sales in France, Spain, Germany and the UK were partially offset by positive comp sales in Australia. Despite restricted operating conditions due to a virus resurgence in the State of Victoria, strong drive-thru and delivery sales drove roughly three quarters of Australia sales, and they grew market share. Australia has also seen an increase in other digital channels such as our mobile app and self-order kiosks as customers use contactless ways to order and pay. Comp sales were positive across all major dayparts for the quarter. In Canada, while comp sales were negative for the quarter, we generated momentum and grew market share as nearly all restaurants reopened in the market. Breakfast recovery continues to lag with positive comps across dinner, evening, and late night, and delivery sales have nearly doubled compared to last year. In the IOM segment, the European markets were impacted the most by the initial wave of the pandemic earlier this year. The UK, France, Italy and Spain had all restaurants closed for a period of time. And other markets, like Germany and Russia were operating with restricted operating hours and limited channels. While all markets were open heading into the third quarter, performance was mixed. And we continue to see slower recovery in city centers and other areas that are heavily reliant on tourism in markets like Spain and Italy. Looking at the UK, sales improved throughout the quarter and comp sales turned positive in August. The UK has been one of our strongest delivery markets for the last couple of years, and that was a key performance driver for the third quarter. We accelerated rollout with a new delivery partner, Just Eat, and complemented it with a marketing activation plan. Over the past several months, our delivery sales percentage has increased in the UK from high single digits to mid-teens. In France and Germany, both markets outperformed broader QSR and gained market share, although sales trends remained negative. In comparison to other markets, France and Germany are more heavily reliant on dine-in sales, with about 70% of their sales from in-restaurant purchases pre-COVID. France is also heavily dependent on travel and tourism, which as I mentioned, has been suppressed throughout the pandemic. And finally, comp sales in the International Developmental License segment were down 10.1%. Comps sequentially improved month-over-month for the quarter, with September down just over 5%. Latin America remained the most challenged geography in this segment due to high incidences of COVID in several countries and its less developed drive-thru penetration. Japan once again delivered strong positive comp sales for the quarter. The market captured heightened demand by growing delivery as well as running successful promotions and value offerings. And in China, we renewed our focus on driving our core menu, along with increasing delivery sales and digital memberships. These efforts led to improved results for the quarter, although we still expect recovery to take some time as consumer confidence has been slow to return. In terms of new unit development, China has opened over 300 new restaurants through September. We remain confident in restaurant growth opportunities in China, with a plan to open over 400 new restaurants this year. Turning to October. In the U.S., sales comps were strong, up mid-single-digits with growth across all dayparts. IOM comp sales remained in the negative low single digits. Australia and the UK, both delivered strong comp sales, while France, Spain and Italy weighed on the segment. We expect performance will continue to vary across the IOM markets, given the recent increase in local restrictions in most markets. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we expect these starts and stops to be the likely operating environment for as long as the virus is present. Given the safety measures we\u2019ve put in place and the operational changes we\u2019ve made to adjust to this new environment, we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to successfully navigate through it. Moving to the P&L, adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 grew 4% in constant currencies for the quarter, after excluding gains on the sale of about 3% of our ownership in McDonald\u2019s Japan. A lower effective tax rate and lower G&A compared to last year contributed to the EPS growth. Foreign currency translation also benefited results by $0.03 per share. While restaurant margin dollars were down 2% in constant currencies, that\u2019s a significant recovery compared to second quarter when restaurant margin dollars were down nearly 40% over last year. As the U.S. business returned to positive comps in the quarter, we also grew both, franchised and Company-owned restaurant margin dollars in the U.S., which benefited from higher gross profit. G&A decreased 3% in constant currencies for the quarter, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and lower travel costs, while we continue to invest in strategic technology initiatives. When looking at the cadence of our G&A spend over the past few years, we\u2019ve historically spent about 30% of our full-year G&A in the fourth quarter. We expect the Q4 G&A percentage this year to be slightly higher than that, given some onetime investments we\u2019re making in renewed brand communications and in actions we\u2019re taking to have an even greater impact with our purpose to feed and foster community. Turning to other operating income and expense. Gains on restaurant sales for the full year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year, with minimal restaurant sales expected for the fourth quarter. Our equity and earnings of affiliates for the full year is projected to be down substantially. And finally, as a reminder, we provided nearly $1 billion of short-term liquidity deferrals to franchisees, at the onset of the pandemic. We\u2019ve now collected roughly half of the deferrals and expect that we\u2019ll collect most of the remaining balance over the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. As a result, in the third quarter, we reduced $27 million of our bad debt reserve, related to rent and royalty deferrals. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be about 23%, resulting in a fourth quarter tax rate of about 25%. Capital expenditures for 2020 are still expected to be around $1.6 billion as we plan to open about 950 gross and 300 net new restaurants by year-end. About half of the $1.6 billion is dedicated to the U.S. business, and we remain on track to complete roughly 900 EOTF projects this year. In October, our Board of Directors approved a 3% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5.16 annually. This marked over 40 consecutive years of increasing our dividend for shareholders and further reinforces our confidence in the Company\u2019s long-term strategy. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring we grow our business, our franchisees remain financially strong, and our shareholders are duly rewarded. Our Velocity Growth Plan served us well over the past few years and gave us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate through this crisis. As our customers\u2019 needs have evolved, so too have elements of our path forward. We\u2019ll continue to further draw on our solid foundation, unique advantages and core equities to meet the needs of today while building towards a better tomorrow. We look forward to sharing the evolution of our growth strategy later this morning at our virtual investor update. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.\nMike Cieplak: Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us. This concludes our third quarter 2020 earnings call.

Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning we will open a queue for your questions. I ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and if you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you and good morning. As I reflect back to our first quarter earnings call, a short 90 days ago, I talked about uncertainty in the world amidst the COVID pandemic, and our methodical approach to reopening, grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. During the second quarter, the dedication of the McDonald's system was on display; as we work together to safely reopen nearly all those McDonald's restaurants that had temporarily closed in late March, leading to continued improvement in our sales results. As of today, nearly all our restaurants globally are open for business. Almost all markets are operating with drive-thru and delivery. And many markets have also begun to reopen dining rooms. I want to say a huge thank you to franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees. Without their continued hard work and dedication, this would not have been possible. We have said that since the start of the pandemic that we entered from a position of strength. Over the last several years our velocity growth plan drove broad-based strength in markets around the world. More importantly, however, we believe McDonald's possesses several unique advantages that ensure our success is built to last. These advantages have been evident throughout the crisis. First is our iconic brand. McDonald's is one of the world's leading brands, and the trust customers have in McDonald's has proven to be a significant advantage during these uncertain times. Customers have been seeking known and familiar brands they can count on. And for our customers while safety is a top concern, the need for value and convenience is also on the rise, playing to McDonald's historic strengths. Second, McDonald's is an execution machine. We know how to run great restaurants and that operating prowess has been put to the ultimate test during the pandemic. Within a matter of weeks, the McDonald's system made operational modifications across 30,000 restaurants, while closing and then reopening another 9,000 restaurants. We introduced new safety procedures in all our restaurants, modified our menus, and develop new contactless ways to serve our customers. Amidst all these changes, customer satisfaction actually improved across almost every major market and U.S. has hit new all-time highs for customer satisfaction. Drive-thru times have also improved across most major markets averaging 15 to 20 seconds of improvement. And speaking of drive-thrus our unmatched drive-thru penetration has allowed us to continue serving more customers in more markets than anyone else. Across our big five IOM markets: Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK, about 70% of our restaurants offer drive-thru. And this safe and convenient service channel has been particularly appealing to our customers during the pandemic. We've seen significant increases in drive-thru sales in these markets during COVID. Finally, the strength of our system, our franchisees, employees, and suppliers has been and always will be our secret sauce. Our three-legged stool is committed to feeding and fostering the nearly 40,000 communities where we operate and the pandemic has demonstrated our system's unwavering commitment. There have been countless examples of our system going above and beyond to be there for those communities who needed us most from healthcare workers to truck drivers, to people working three shifts to make mask and respirators. We stayed open, so they could keep going. Every franchisee comes from and is rooted in the local community. They take responsibility for building the local community which is why our brand is strongest at the local level. Thanks to market and franchisee leadership, we're able to identify opportunities to be good neighbors in ways that are the most meaningful to customers. And this has been especially important the last few months. Our suppliers ensured that we had no breaks in supply for food, packaging, material, toys, equipment or other strategic categories globally. This is an incredible feat, given some of the significant challenges experienced in the past few months, and a testament to our strong supply chain teams, both globally and locally, and the partnership that they have with our suppliers. At the same time, in just a matter of weeks, our teams built a global supply chain for PPE virtually from scratch. Turning to our Q2 operating results, I'll provide a few headlines and observations and then, Kevin, will provide more details including key financials. In the U.S., virtually all restaurants remained open and we saw results improve sequentially through the quarter. To ensure we kept our crew and customer safe while remaining open, we've changed nearly 50 operating procedures in accordance with guidance from state and local health experts. In Q2, we also ran a highly successful Thank You Meal program to recognize the extraordinary dedication and selflessness of first responders. In our International Operated Market segment, when we last spoke about 45% of our restaurants were open in some manner. Several of our largest markets including the UK, Spain, France, and Italy were completely closed for prolonged periods during the quarter. With a methodical approach, however our teams have reopened restaurants across this segment and nearly all restaurants are now open to serve customers. We've seen strong pent-up customer demand which is driving encouraging sequential sales improvement. Finally, our International Developmental License segment experienced several challenges throughout the quarter. Our Latin America business was severely pressured due to the high incidence of Coronavirus in several countries and is less developed through drive-thru penetration. In China after early signs suggesting a solid recovery, our pace of improvement has slowed, as customers remain wary of social activities and we now expect this more subdued pattern to continue into 2021. Worth noting that Japan had positive comp sales for the quarter, partly thanks to our brands reputation for cleanliness and convenience with Japanese customers. As you can see, it remains a dynamic situation, as the threat of COVID-19 continues to depress consumer sentiment and the vagaries of the pandemic create an unpredictable operating environment. In many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public health situation appears to be worsening. Nonetheless, I believe that Q2 represents the trough in our performance, as McDonald's has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment. Regardless of the overall level of industry growth, I believe, our markets and franchisees are well-positioned to grow market share going forward. Three factors give me confidence. First, the financial health of our system is strong. As you know, we move quickly defer rent and royalties for franchisees injecting nearly a billion dollars of liquidity into our system at the outset of the pandemic. When necessary, we're providing timely, targeted, and temporary assistance to franchisees needing additional support. Government programs such as the PPP program in the U.S. and the Chancellor's program in the UK also provided strong financial relief to our franchisees. And the menu and operational modifications we introduced have further supported franchisees P&L. Collectively, these actions have significantly reduced the adverse cash flow impact of COVID-19 on the average McDonald's restaurant. Second, we've amassed a sizable marketing war chest to invest in the back half of 2020. During Q2 most major markets significantly reduced their marketing spend and value activities. As an example in the U.S., marketing spend was down 70%, as we chose to conserve our resources until the situation stabilized. These funds will now be reinvested in Q3 and Q4. Additionally, as we've previously announced, McDonald's will also invest an incremental $200 million in marketing spend across our U.S. and International Operated Markets in the second half to accelerate recovery, roughly equivalent to one additional month of media in every owned market. Together, these actions will result in a sizeable increase in our marketing spend for the balance of the year. And third, our laser-like focus and what we call the 3Ds, drive-thru, delivery and digital. Thanks to our strategic foresight, McDonald's is well developed in each of these channels and we see opportunities to extend our 3D advantage. You'll hear more about the 3Ds in our strategic plans later in the year. Again, I want to thank our system for the extraordinary dedication and resilience they demonstrated in Q2, and to our customers, I want to thank you for your trust in McDonald's. We're ready to serve. I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our second quarter results.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. I'll start by walking through our comp performance for the quarter and an early read on July, move on to some items on the P&L, and then end with an update on our financial position. While this quarter was not without its challenges, we're encouraged by our global comp sales improvement throughout the quarter, and into July. Comps improved sequentially throughout Q2, as markets reopened and restrictions were eased. Global comp sales were down 24% for the quarter and improved as we progress through the quarter, with the month of June down 12%. We entered the quarter with about 75% of our restaurants open. And as Chris noted, today nearly all have reopened to serve customers. While in June, we recovered nearly 90% of our 2019 sales. Performance across the markets is varied and uneven, depending on external factors such as government restrictions, and consumer sentiment giving concerns of resurgence. For as long as the virus is present, this is the likely operating environment, especially as we also consider government assistance to consumers rolling-off in many markets and general economic uncertainty, and we believe we're well-positioned to navigate through at all. That said some consistent themes have emerged. Comp sales continue to be heavily reliant on check growth from larger orders with guest counts negative. The number of drive-thrus impacts the market pace of recovery. As Chris mentioned, our drive-thrus overall have proven to be a competitive advantage for us and markets with a higher percentage of drive-thrus are showing quicker recovery. Markets with a higher concentration of City Center and mall restaurants are seeing heavier impact from reduced foot traffic and travel or tourist dependent locations are slower to recover as mobility remains suppressed. In looking at performance across the segments, the International Operated Market segment experienced a sharp decline with more than half of the restaurants temporarily closed early in the quarter. Comp sales were down 41% for the quarter, improving to down 18% for the month of June, as key markets like France began reopening in May and the UK began reopening in June. Australia delivered positive comp sales for both May and June bolstered by strong drive-thru and delivery performance. Australia has doubled its delivery sales mix to nearly 10% of sales, a trend we're seeing across several of our international markets. While we've seen a significant uptick in drive-thru as a percentage of total sales throughout the segment, a crucial step in our recovery is the reopening of dining rooms. Pre-COVID, nearly 70% of customer orders were in restaurants across our larger markets. So closing the dining area or even limiting dining capacity has a substantial impact on results. Today, almost all restaurants and about two-thirds of the dining rooms have reopened in the segment, although many restaurants are still operating with restrictions such as limited hours or channels based on local regulations. In July, comp sales in the IOM segment have continued to improve, although they remain negative in the high-single-digits. Turning to the U.S., comp sales for the quarter were down 8.7% and improved as we progressed through the quarter, with June down 2.3%. Breakfast continues to be disproportionately impacted by disruptions to commuting routines and while weekend recovery is still like lagging weekday recovery, the gap is narrowing. Throughout the pandemic, we've benefited greatly from nearly all of our restaurants remaining open to serve customers particularly with drive-thrus in nearly 95% of our locations. As customers shifted to a more contactless experience, drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of our sales again this quarter. We also continue to see an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurants. Mid-quarter, we began to reopen dining rooms in the U.S. with reduced seating capacity for customers who want to enjoy their food on premise. In early July, we paused as we've seen resurgences across the country, and today we have about 2,000 dining rooms open. Together with our franchisees, we're taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to determine the right time to reopen the remaining dining rooms. The U.S. has continued to see improving comp sales through July, with comps turning slightly positive during the month. Comp sales in the International Developmental License segment were down 24% for the quarter, with the month of May and June both down about 20%. As Chris mentioned, Latin America was the hardest hit geography across the segment, while Japan delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. And in China, recovery has been somewhat uneven, as consumers remain cautious on resuming pre-COVID routines, especially in light of resurgence concerns. Increased competitive activity and the fact that schools have been closed also are impacting the pace of recovery. In terms of new unit development, China has opened about 150 restaurants through June. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China, with a plan to open about 400 new restaurants this year. While we expect recovery to continue to be somewhat gradual and uneven for many markets around the globe in the near-term, we're proud of our teams and the way we've responded to the pandemic. Moving to the P&L, as we become a more heavily franchised business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and efficiently convert top-line growth to the bottom line. Despite the challenging environment, McDonald's restaurants generated over $19 billion in system-wide sales for the quarter. Franchise margins represented about 90% of overall margin dollars and were a key component of operating income. There are a couple P&L lines specifically impacted by COVID-19 related items. First, G&A increased $114 million or 22% in constant currencies for the quarter. As Chris mentioned, the company is making an incremental marketing contribution to the U.S. and IOM markets. The amount related to that contribution included in G&A for Q2 was about $160 million, which more than offset lower travel costs and lower incentive compensation accruals. Turning to the other operating income and expense section, gains on restaurant sales for the full-year are still expected to be down significantly versus last year, as we anticipate a minimal amount of restaurant sale activity for the remainder of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates for the full-year is projected to be down substantially. We recorded an additional $45 million for reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals for Q2. And finally, in further supporting our franchisees, we made one-time payments of about $30 million to distribution centers for obsolete inventory. This was the result of the abrupt reduction in consumer demand and product mix shifts early in the pandemic. As I've mentioned before, the financial health of our system was an underlying strength of our business coming into the pandemic and we've taken actions to preserve financial flexibility. As a reminder, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We also bolstered our financial position by securing $6.5 billion of new financing back in Q1. This enabled us to invest in the system in several ways. We provided nearly a $1 billion of broad-based financial liquidity assistance to our franchisees primarily in the form of rent and royalty deferrals. As a result, free cash flow was negative in the second quarter and positive for the first half of the year. Based on our current operating performance, and our anticipated collection of a majority of the deferrals in Q3 and Q4, we still expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year. Further building on the broad-based liquidity support, we're also assessing the financial health of specific at-risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. We're using an objective framework for decision making and we expect that only a small percent of organizations will require further assistance. The financial health and strength of our franchisees has been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years and we expect that to continue. Finally, as we've mentioned, we invested in incremental marketing across the U.S. and IOM markets to further accelerate recovery and drive growth. In terms of capital expenditures, we took a very practical approach to development activity during the onset of the pandemic by pausing most project work. As many franchisees are willing and able to invest and some work has resumed, our expected capital spend for 2020 is now about $1.6 billion versus the original $2.4 billion. About half of the $1.6 billion will be dedicated to the U.S. business including completing roughly 900 EOTF projects. Additionally, we now plan to open about 950 gross and 350 net new restaurants this year. The U.S. is accelerating some restaurant closings previously planned for future years. Of the 200 U.S. closures for this year, over half are low volume restaurants in Walmart store locations. Consistent with enhancing financial flexibility and our franchising strategy, we're planning to divest a portion of our stake in McDonald's Japan. As a result of the strong performance of the McDonald's Japan business over the past few years, and our confidence in the local management team, we believe it's the right time to gradually reduce our ownership stake in the market. This will take some time because of the low trading volume of McDonald's Japan shares. As a reminder, we currently own about 49% of the business, and we will retain at least 35% ownership. This decision provides us with additional financial flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy, while also demonstrating our commitment to our Japanese business. Regarding uses of cash, our top priorities remain the same. First investing in the business for growth and second prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, we'll look to reduce debt in the near-term to lower our elevated leverage ratios. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business, our franchisees remain financially strong, and our shareholders are duly rewarded. Now I'll turn it back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. Here at McDonald's, we remain well-positioned to operate through this crisis from a position of competitive strength, and we're confident in our ability to grow market share as we look ahead. Tomorrow, we're holding our first ever digital convening of operators, suppliers and employees worldwide. We're calling it our worldwide connection. We'll use this touch point to reflect on the inherent strengths of our system by highlighting the enduring values that will continue to guide us as we move forward. Just as we've done since the very beginning, we'll draw on our solid foundation, unique advantages, and core equities to meet the needs of today, while building towards a better tomorrow. Our customer focus and current prioritization of resources will be importantly resist as we drive our recovery and we will continue to use our strategic agility to adapt to the evolving environment. While the velocity growth plan has served us well and elements of the plan will continue to be important, we will continue to evolve the strategy as needed to meet the needs of the customer. We look forward to sharing updates later in the year. And now we'll begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions].\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thanks. Your breakfast has been a bit of a sore spot for the U.S. business over the left several years despite efforts in place to help improve performance focused on value advertising and innovation. So can you talk a little bit about why efforts to reinvigorate breakfast will be different under Joe, during different -- during a time when morning routines are seeing pronounced disruption? And let me just clarify one thing with July U.S. comps slightly positive for the month or do they trend slightly positive at some point during the month? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Good morning, Andrew. Thank you for the question and on the breakfast point. Certainly, as we've talked about on prior calls, breakfast has been one of the more challenged daypart due to Coronavirus. You mentioned and you alluded to the fact that we have had challenges in breakfast over a longer period of time. I think there's been a couple areas there that have driven that. Certainly one has been a much more increased level of competitive activity that we've seen in breakfast. Breakfast as you know prior to the pandemic was the only daypart that was growing. And so as a result, there were a lot of new competitors that were flooding into the breakfast daypart. That certainly was one area of pressure for us. And then I would also just honestly say some of it was around focus and we were not as focused as we were rolling out other things like hot off the grill, the other dayparts for us took on more time and energy and investment. And so as we emerge out of this, I think part of it is certainly going to be a rededication from a marketing and investment standpoint to go after breakfast. I think our ability through the drive-thrus right now to be fast at breakfast is certainly an advantage that we're looking for going forward. And then we will have innovation in breakfast as well. If you look at how we've performed through the pandemic, even though breakfast is certainly in the U.S. still the most challenged daypart. We're actually growing our breakfast share in. And so while it is a drag from an overall standpoint, we're gaining share at breakfast and I know the U.S. operators and Joe are hopeful to continue that trend. As to the point about July, let me pass it over to Kevin, to give you some specifics.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, Andrew, related to July U.S. comps, I say they trended up a little bit throughout the month, but they've been running slightly positive for most of the month. And obviously with a few days left, we expect it to be slightly positive for the full month also.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I was wondering, Kevin, if you could give us a sense of what the comps in the units in IOM are running when you exclude all the impact from the closures and I guess a second and related question would be, what do you think the biggest impediments in those markets are in terms of getting back to positive? Is that a matter of -- or do you think something else will be needed to see a positive number?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, thanks David. All right. A couple of things. Let's talk about July. I'll talk about July primarily since it's our most recent information. We talked about Australia being positive. And I'll give a quick round of the Big Five markets, if you will. Australia, we talked about being positive in May and June, they continue to be positive in July. Now remember, Australia was one of the few markets around the world in addition to Canada and U.S. that remained open through all this. So they've got a little different profile, certainly than the European markets. Canada, I'd say is relatively similar to how the U.S. is behaving, meaning that they are just turning slightly positive in July. And again remember they remained open. So I use the U.S. kind of profile as a proxy for Canada. Europe that is obviously a little different. France, Germany and UK, France and the UK were completely closed remember, so they're a little slower to return. I mentioned that France began reopening in May, UK began reopening in June. UK is just beginning to reopen dining rooms. So you've got those different dynamics going on in the European markets. If I look at those three markets in total, they're roughly I will call them negative, high-single-digits to low double-digits. So that overall, when you look at those five markets in July, we're running probably high, I'm sorry mid negative single-digits for that group of five in July. As far as the factors that are impacting those, a couple of things. I think one is the fact that, David, a several of those markets, as I mentioned, were fully closed. So it's just, while there's an immediate rush back and we all see the lines in the drive-thru et cetera. The reality is after a week or a couple of weeks if things settle down, it does take a little bit of time to kind of build up and get back to more closer to normal, I'll say. Dining rooms is a big thing. As I mentioned in my script going into COVID about 70% of our orders were in restaurants. And so I think an order to fully get certainly guest counts back, it'll be getting the dining rooms open in all of those markets. And then the other thing that goes on in some of those European markets is specific locations whether that's travel centers or tourist locations. Some countries certainly the France's, Spain's, Italy's are more dependent on tourism. And so you see some of those markets being impacted more than others.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks and good morning. My question is about unit growth. And I think there was a time maybe not long ago; pre-COVID that there was a thought at McDonald's that this was maybe an opportunity to start to accelerate unit growth particularly in some of those international markets. Do you think that opportunity has changed? Has it gotten better? When you talk about reducing unit growth this year, what's the primary factor? Is it franchisee lack of willingness because there's a distraction? Or is it just the construction? What -- how you think about unit growth going forward, what are causes for the delay and is this even a bigger opportunity as many other restaurants have talked about in terms of opportunity to gain share, excuse me and gain better real estate as a result of COVID?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, thanks, John. So let me yes, first let me talk about this year which to your point, I think this year, what we are seeing is, there was certainly immediate or near-term disruption both with our franchisees and in the construction industry in a lot of those markets. So that's why you're seeing why we're seeing, I'll say reduced openings this year. That doesn't change our belief in the opportunity going forward; especially I'd say in Europe, where I think there may be some independent restaurants units that are having some bigger challenges, which may present further opportunities for us. So our expectation is that beginning next year, we go back to kind of where we thought we would have been for unit growth in 2021. And again, especially in Europe, we believe there's a lot of opportunity for growth. I mentioned in our script that China is continuing to grow. So we think that they'll still open of our 400 units this year. But Europe, which we have slowed down a little bit this year because of the near-term disruption, our expectation right now and obviously that's all dependent on what happens with the pandemic going forward. But right now our expectation is to get back to having significant unit growth in Europe. We do think there's a lot of opportunities in our key markets in Europe.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower: Thanks for taking the question. I'm just curious, I think, Chris, you'd mentioned earlier that in the U.S., obviously, you've made some fairly significant operational procedure changes and in particular, I believe you've pulled some menu items off including all day breakfast. So can you discuss what you think will remain as permanent changes versus what are temporary tied to the pandemic right now?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure, thanks, Jon. So if you look at the menu, you're right, we went to limited menu. It was largely our core menu in the U.S., and a number of other major markets around the world had a number of benefits to us. It certainly made the restaurants easier to operate particularly as we had some challenges with just staffing levels due to Coronavirus. It also had a very positive benefit around productivity and margins. All of that was also very helpful as we navigated through the second quarter. As we come out of it, as I've said in prior times, I think it is a safe bet that you're going to see us add items back to the menu. I think it's also equally a safe bet that we're not going to go all the way back to where we were. And so how that evolution looks is going to vary market to market in the U.S., I do know that there is innovation that is planned for later this year that's going to bring some menu items on. And then with U.S. operators have talked about with our team has been, let's just make sure every item that we add earns its way back onto the menu. And I think that mentality that mindset is how not just the U.S. but every market is sort of looking at it.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. In your International Operated Markets and the big three in Europe in particular, could you talk to sales trends by format meaning units with drive-thru versus walk-in only units and relatedly I don't know if you're able to see that informal eating out market trend lately and know how you're maybe doing in terms of market share trends. I'm very curious to know if the pain is really great out there from a competitive set that is walk-in only and that could be sort of making the bed for you in a positive way as things get back to dining rooms being open. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Hi David, it's Chris. I'll take the first part of that and then if Kevin has anything else to add, I'll pass it off to him. But I think overall, what you're talking about is accurate or certainly something that is worth paying attention to in Europe, which is in Europe, we do face a different competitive set, it tends to be in many cases, smaller operators, bakeries, kind of places that are much more dependent on the walk-in business. Those competitors in countries like France and Germany are certainly under quite a bit of pressure. And we're seeing that right now from a variety of different media that we're hearing about some of the difficulty that exists in those markets. That does create for us an opportunity to take share because of our drive-thru business. I won't get into sort of the by-format details, but I would just say in general and Kevin laid out in his opening remarks, when we have a drive-thru business, you do tend to see those businesses come back faster. Consumers are more in the habit of going to that restaurant and then they see the dining rooms open. And that leads to a faster recovery on the dining room business. But now with basically almost all of our dining rooms opened in Europe, even if you didn't have a drive-thru, we're seeing a nice recovery there. It's just not as fast as if you had a drive-thru that was allowing you to operate as well. And Kevin, I'll pass it off to you for anything else you want to add.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, just to give a little detail on what Chris was just saying. Just to give some numbers about if I look at those big three in Europe that you mentioned, France, Germany, UK, roughly two-thirds of the restaurants in those markets have a drive-thru. And if we think about pre-COVID about a third of our sales in those markets were through the drive-thru pre-COVID, now about two-thirds of our sales are through the drive-thru. So we've certainly seen the advantage of having drive-thrus in those markets. And as Chris mentioned that those do tend to come back quicker than the restaurants without drive-thru.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask about China. And I know it's not at this point a huge contributor to EBIT, but just the read for other markets. You said that you are seeing kind of a retrenchment, customers remain wary and you'll expect to see that into 2021. I guess as you think about the risk of more research in COVID in other markets, is that primarily the implication or is there some function of China we've heard there may be more lockdown in some of the cities and than what we've seen in other countries, just trying to understand kind of if you'd expect to see a similar retrenchment in other markets? And I guess related to that in the U.S., if you could just talk about the difference in dayparts or what you're seeing between weekends and weekdays, if there any kind of different behavior patterns that you can tell us about that? I'm just trying to sort of get a sense of how to think about recovery from here depending on the different scenarios that might occur?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Thanks, Sara. I do think China's probably more unique and therefore probably not a good proxy to think about for the other market. Start with the fact that in China, only about 15% of the restaurants there have drive-thru. And so for all the reasons that we've already been talking about, it's a different dynamic and a more challenging dynamic when you don't have a drive-thru business. So I think that's one big difference. I think also you mentioned -- you touched on, there has been kind of a variety of different government actions and I'd say sort of several different waves of the coronavirus. All of that when you take it in combination with the fact that there have been other epidemics in China, I think all of that is weighing on the minds of the Chinese consumer and definitely making them more wary. What you're seeing in China is you're seeing many of the kind of non-Western restaurants go to very aggressive value programs right now trying to stimulate some demand in the market. And we do think that that market is going to be more promotional certainly through the balance of this year again as competitors are all trying to get some traffic stimulated there and encourage people to come out of their house. So longwinded way of saying I think China, there's a number of factors that are going on in China that don't allow it to really be a good read-through to other markets. As to the U.S. and the difference between weekdays and weekends, certainly earlier in the pandemic, we were seeing a bigger head on weekends. As we've now moved through that and getting to -- I guess I'd say more of a steady state in terms of where we're at. That disparity between the weekend and weekdays is evening out and it's not as pronounced as it was earlier. Weekend still does provide a tougher comp, a tougher lap than the weekday. But again, the disparity that we saw between weekend and weekdays is leveling out.\nKevin Ozan: And then, I'll just add dayparts that you mentioned. I think as Chris mentioned earlier, breakfast is the biggest drag, if you will, in comp but we're gaining share at breakfast. It's just that the overall breakfast market is declining. That'd be for June and into July. I'd say for the U.S. that is. Dinner both in June and July is contributing the comps has been positive. And then I would say lunch is in between the two.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You talked a bit about the marketing more just in the back half of the year. I'm just wondering what role innovation will play, I know there was a bit of a pause due to pandemic, just started to crank back up a little bit and should we expect to see anything through the balance of the year?\nChris Kempczinski: There will be some innovation. I would say that the bulk of that spend is not intended to be going toward innovation, the bulk of that spend is intended for really core menu items and perhaps spotlighting some of our service channel opportunities, like for example, digital. But as I said earlier, when I talk about menu, we're going to have some menu innovation in the U.S. in the back half of the year. So it may get some but I wouldn't think about that that war chest is being deployed largely against innovation, it is going to be largely against the base business because our view is right now consumers are still looking for sort of the trusted favorites, which is why core menu makes sense for us.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could frame the increase you're seeing in the check in the U.S. And have you seen any sequential change in the check as you moved through the quarter or is mobility increases in certain markets?\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Chris. So the check, I think industry-wide there were some big check numbers out there. Part of it was due to mix, so your saw delivery becoming a much more pronounced part of the mix during Q2. Also I think what we're seeing is just larger order sizes, kind of this dynamic, we'll send someone out to order on behalf of the whole family. And so all of that, we're seeing average checks going up call it 30% increase in average check in the U.S. And in terms of what that looks like going forward, we're starting to see it rebalance to what you would imagine are more normal or sustaining levels meaning the traffic is improving. As traffic is improving, you're seeing check come down in terms of its contribution to growth but still we are in a negative traffic environment. And it is being driven largely by check but just the trajectory of it is starting to look a little bit more, as you would expect.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Just a question on the likelihood of a recession coming forward ahead of what, once we look past COVID, just wanting to get your thoughts on potential U.S. recession versus 12 years ago or perhaps you're seeing certain international markets where you're seeing some outside consumer weakness, just wondering how the McDonald's brand has changed over that time for the better to help insulate or whether your strategy might change, willingness to push more value or otherwise, just trying to get a sense for the outlook, if there's any market that you see recessionary concerns on horizon? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: One of the things that we do is we do every week a tracking survey of consumers across most of our major markets, and I would say one of the things that we have -- that definitely pops in that is concern the anxiety that exists out there around the economy and consumers belief that we are in a sort of recessionary type of dynamic, it's been interesting in many cases, and I think even in our most recent poll that we did, you see economic concerns eclipse public health or public safety concerns. And so as I look at all of that, I'm certainly not qualified to make any predictions around whether we're going to be in recession or not, but I'd certainly say there's a lot of warning signs out there that would suggest that the consumer sentiment and consumer concern about the economy is negative and going in the wrong direction. As we think about what that means for our business and Kevin can talk more about this, but our business tends to be pretty resilient, whether it's through recessionary times or through times of growth, and so we feel well-positioned during those types of periods. But I think you're touching on something that's important, which is, as you go into potentially a more recessionary type of environment in a number of major markets, having good affordability and making sure that that is a key component of your marketing mix is really important. And that's the conversation that I know our leadership teams and markets around the world, including the U.S. are having with our franchisees right now. One of the things that we need to make sure is that coming out of Q2 and I think maybe some of the -- just the shock that sort of went through the system as the pandemic spread, we ended up, as I talked about in terms of our reduction of marketing support, we went into more of a defensive posture. Now as we kind of go into a more normal or what we're kind of saying new normal, next normal, whatever the phrase you want to use operating environment, it's time for us to get back on the front foot. That's why we have the marketing war chest, but it also means that we are going to need to be thinking about how affordability and value can play for all the reasons you were mentioning in your question.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you very much. A two-part question, if I may. First, obviously there have been a lot of consumer behavior changes because of COVID. And I was curious as what behaviors that you think will come back to normal to 2019, for example, and if any of that is basically leading you to reconsider the way that some of your dining rooms are going to be used, in other words, separating the temporary change from consumer behavior using dining rooms, and sitting next to each other, what have you to more permanent ones? And the second part of the question is from an organizational perspective, Chris, you obviously, you've got the head seat of McDonald's at a very auspicious time with such a major disruptive event. You're coming shortly after you took the job. Where are you in terms of thinking about the right organizational structure from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view, the overall McDonald's organization as we look forward? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, thanks, John. On the dine-in, I'm very happy that and I mentioned this, I think on our last earnings call that we are almost completely through our EOTF remodel program, I think that has positioned us very well for the future. Certainly one of the questions that I get from franchisees, hey, we spend on the dining rooms as we went into the pandemic, do we still feel good about that? And my answer is absolutely. In fact, if you look at some of the markets like Australia, for example, that have remained open that have had dining rooms open, one of the interesting things is we're seeing kiosk usage in Australia is up by a meaningful amount. And so I think some of the things that we did with experience of the future and the order modifications where the new order channels like kiosk are playing right to this. Now, certainly, what we're seeing overall and Kevin mentioned this is that dine-in as a percent of our business is a smaller amount today because of the growth of drive-thru. I think our view is as you look out over a longer period of time, we do believe that dine-in is still going to be an important part of the mix. We're not going to be able to get to growing traffic without getting our dine-ins open. So I think we are still going to see dine-ins as being an important part of the business but in terms of enduring behavior, I think whether it's the use of kiosk, the use of mobile, the use of delivery, the use of drive-thru, certainly one of the things is that customers are looking for more of a contactless type of experience. They're looking for more of a digital type of experience, one that they can navigate on their own. I do think that that behavior is going to be an enduring change which is why I mentioned that the 3Ds for us: delivery, drive-thru and digital are going to be important strategic priorities for us for the foreseeable future, and we'll have more to share about that. In terms of work changes, I must admit, I've not heard my coming in as being described as auspicious, but I'll take auspicious, so thank you for that. But for us, there's -- there have been certainly a lot of twist and turn in the COVID road, we're looking at what does all of this mean for the longer-term, but I don't anticipate that there's going to be any major changes that we would do as a result. As all of you know, we went through a pretty significant G&A rationalization over the last several years, not just in the U.S. but globally. And I think that that put us in a very good position for where we're at now. And when I look at expense and layers and all the typical things that you look at from a G&A perspective, I think we're in pretty good shape there. But there are going to be areas that we're going to need to think about, and I'll just highlight one as we move to more virtual learning. How do we think about training and development? And what does that organization need to look like? What's going to be the balance of in-person training that we do versus training that might be done virtually? So there will be some things that we need to think about organizationally. But I would say that those are on the margins. I don't anticipate anything substantive for the broader group.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChris Carril: Thanks and good morning. In your recent discussions with franchisees, where's been the greatest focus in terms of the opportunities for continued improvement moving forward? So are these conversations mainly focused on continued operational improvements and efficiencies? Or is the focus beginning to turn to other demand deriving opportunities from here like menu innovation or loyalty? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure, it's definitely on the latter. I think we have done a great job and credit to franchisees across the globe around grabbing the opportunity to improve how our restaurants are running. As we were mentioning earlier, we see customer satisfaction scores in I think eight out of our top 11 markets are up and up by a pretty significant amount. I think all of that is credit to the operational modifications that we've made. But as we've now I think gotten those embedded, there is an opportunity for us to get aggressive in going after share in. And that's the marketing war chest that I talked about earlier. But that's getting on the front food on things like affordability. And so that conversation does vary market by market, depending on what's going on. But I think the mentality for us now is -- is that we have gotten the business to a good position I think, regardless of whether we enter a recession, don't enter a recession. Whether we have resurgence, we don't have a resurgence of the virus. All of those things are going to vary by country, our mindset needs to be now pivoted strongly towards going after share because I think that's the opportunity that we have.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. My question is on delivery. And I just wanted to know about how that's progressed. And as the mobility in the U.S. has improved and people are going to the drive-thru more and getting out and about, if you've seen delivery actually either come down as a percent of sales or absolute dollars. And then I just wanted a clarification. I think you said before that 70% of the business was dine-in in the international market or is that 70% purchases in-store, so not necessarily sitting down and dining, but grabbing and going as well from an in-store purchase?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, let's get Kevin in on the action here, Kevin?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, so on the delivery; I'd say across the board really in basically every one of our markets, certainly I think every one of our significant markets. We're seeing delivery as a percent of sales go up. I mentioned in my remarks, Australia specifically growing to about almost 10% of sales. And we've got several markets on the international side at that 10 or above even. The U.S. isn't that 10% of sales but it has grown significantly during the pandemic. So and that's even with drive-thru growing significantly, et cetera. So we're not seeing either drive-thru, take away from delivery or delivery take away from drive-thru. Both are growing significantly. And again, that's a pretty consistent theme around the world I'd say. Again, overall delivery as a percent of sales in the U.S. is a little lower, certainly than most of our international markets, but growth across the board. The second question was, oh yes, the 70% of restaurants; the 70% that I mentioned of our international markets is in restaurant ordering meaning that they were going in the restaurant. Some of those were eating in and some of those were taking away. But they were actually ordering at the front counter at the kiosk in the restaurant versus going through the drive-thru. So it wasn't all dine-in, it was just kind of in-restaurant ordering which again could mean front counter or could mean kiosk.\nMike Cieplak: We will take one last question from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit about the federal assistance that's been being paid out, if you guys think there's any benefit that you're seeing that you can see in your numbers from the weekly unemployment benefits, the Fed has been given out that's set to expire soon. And then just lastly, if there's any comments you guys can make on financing environment for franchisees both in the U.S. and globally their access to capital, has that been curtailed at all or any sort of impact given the virus concerns?\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Peter, I'll take the first part. And then Kevin can closeout with the second. But as you think about the government programs, they've certainly been helpful when the first checks got cut on the $600 in the U.S, I mean I think the impact of that was pretty apparent very quickly. Now to some degree it is built into kind of the trends that we're seeing but the prospect of it rolling off, I think our expectation would be for the same reasons that it was simulative, when it first was put in, there would be some negative implication if that were to roll-off. Now whether, a rolling-off of, went from $600 to $200, I don't know we're that good to parse the details to that degree, but there certainly was a benefit not just in the U.S., but we've seen it in a number of other markets around the world that the government fiscal policy has had a positive benefit on comp. And then Kevin, I'll pass it to you for the expire.\nKevin Ozan: On financing for our franchisees in general, our franchisees are still able to get financing pretty much around the world as they need it. They have access to capital certainly and one of the positives we've seen in the U.S. given that's why we're actually continuing to do those EOTF projects and the franchisees want to invest in the businesses. They've got cash flow; they have access to capital and are willing to invest. So we haven't seen any drying up of financing pretty much around the world. I say that but I'd also say we do have some international markets where again they were closed for potentially a couple of months even at a time. And some individual franchisees would have taken on some heavy debt over the last several years between EOTF projects potentially purchasing our restaurants et cetera. So there are individual organizations that I say are a little stretched. But it isn't a lack of access to capital. It's really just kind of working through their ratios.\nMike Cieplak: Okay, thank you, Chris and Kevin. Thanks everyone for joining. That will conclude our call. Have a good day.\nOperator: This does conclude McDonald's Corporation investor conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-04-30 12:16:21", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's First Quarter 2020 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our Web site, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.

Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our Web site. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Would imagine we'll be spending a good portion of today's call discussing how COVID-19 has impacted our business, but I want to start by acknowledging the human toll of this pandemic. Let me express our deepest sympathies to those inside and outside of McDonald's who have been affected by this virus. In particular, I want to extend heartfelt thanks and gratitude to healthcare professionals, first responders, and other essential workers around the world who have put their own lives at risk to help others. The global crisis has impacted people and communities everywhere. In the face of such enormous challenges, I'm immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system and the tireless efforts of our franchisees, crew members, suppliers, and company employees. Where we've been able to stay open safely and responsible, they've made it possible for McDonald's to continue offering great-tasting, affordable, and convenient food amidst widespread change and disruption. Turning now to our performance for the quarter, our Velocity Growth Plan drove strong results in 2019. That momentum carried into January and February. Since then the outbreak of coronavirus around the world has created a major business disruption that adversely impacted our performance. Beginning in mid-March, we experienced a significant decline in our business due to the pandemic, dragging down our Q1 global comparable sales by 3.4%. We're now operating in a completely different world, and we expect these changes to persist long after the crisis is over. In times like these we take strength from the resilience and experiences we've developed over our 65-year history. While we're not immune to the immediate pressures threatening our global community, we came into this situation better positioned than most, and we believe that we will strengthen our competitive advantages following the crisis. Entering the crisis our system was in great shape. In addition to McDonald's strong balance sheet, franchisee cash flows in most of our major markets were at or near record highs in 2019. Our global restaurant estate had been largely modernized, and we'd made significant investments to build new capabilities in delivery and digital that have proven to be critical to our business during the pandemic. We now navigate through the crisis. McDonald's unmatched global footprint, scale, and deep operational expertise are also proving to be significant strengths for us. Specifically, with a presence in over a hundred markets, we've been able to develop insights and best practices as countries move through different phases of the outbreak. In China, where the outbreak began, we quickly learned how to adjust our operations to enhance crew and customer safety. We developed new positioning guides and piloted contactless delivery. These solutions along with many others were then shared around the globe. As each country develops their own innovations these are quickly shared by our Global Restaurant Solutions Group across all markets. Our system's ability to quickly adapt operations across 40,000 restaurants has been incredible to see. The size and scale of our supply chain has also proven to be a significant advantage during this crisis. To date, despite the disruption or business we've had no break in supply for any food, packaging materials, toys, equipment, logistics, or other solutions globally. I want to give particular recognition to our supply chain team for sourcing vital PPE materials, such as masks. To give you just some sense of the scale with which we operate our global supply chain team has sourced over 120 million masks to meet the needs of the McDonald's system, and of course, McDonald's strong Drive-thru development has continued to allow us to safely serve millions of customers each day while adhering to social distancing mandates or guidelines. In the U.S., nearly 95% of our locations have Drive-thru, and virtually all are open to serve healthcare professionals, first responders, other essential workers, and customers looking for their McDonald's moment. Similarly, Australia and Canada have been able to safely remain open. Finally, I should not that our global delivery sales are up significantly versus pre COVID. Our restaurant footprint and customers' love for our brand make us an essential partner for any third-party operator. Once we emerge from this crisis our expectation is that McDonald's can further extend its leadership in every market where we operate. To do this it's essential that our franchisees have the financial wherewithal to capitalize on the opportunities we think will be available to our system. For that reason we've taken several steps to help our franchisees and developmental licensees maintain their liquidity and financial strength. While there will continue to be difficult decisions along the way, we are providing timely, targeted, and temporary financial support, which Kevin will walk through in a few minutes. From a customer perspective, we're encouraged by some of our early learnings that lead us to believe customers will be seeking known brands and familiar routines. We're also seeing a heightened focus on value and convenience. In China, this was reflected in the response to our recent Big Mac promotion, showed that after a prolonged disruption of their daily lives customers are craving comfort in our iconic core menu items. We've also seen this where we've been able to safely remain open, in cities like Tokyo, Berlin, and Chicago, and in Northern France where we slowly began reopening restaurants last week. As I mentioned earlier, our reopening efforts in our European markets will be phased and grounded in what's best for the safety of our customers and crew. Similar to what we did in U.S. and Canada, we'll be serving a limited menu in many markets, focused primarily on our core items when we reopen in countries around the world. Through this we will focus on what McDonald's has done so well for decades: serving great tasting food fast. This is a challenging and unpredictable time. Looking at comparable sales, we expect the second quarter as a whole to be significantly worse than what we experienced for the full month of March. Kevin will talk about what we have seen in the month of April. As things stand, we believe we have reached the through in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March. We are planning for limited reopenings in markets in the near future. The exact trajectory of our recovery, however, is highly uncertain and dependant on many factors outside our control such as government mandates, the risk of a second wave of infection, the availability of testing, and the overall economic backdrop. We are developing contingency plans for a wide variety of scenarios. From our experience in China as well as from our experience closing and opening 10,000 restaurants as part of our EOTF remodel program in the U.S., we do know that customers will not immediately revert back to their pre-shutdown routines. For example, we know that breakfast will be the most challenged day part. We know that a focus on core menu will be critical due to both customer interest and familiar favorites and operational ease. We know that value will be a necessary element to reengage our customers. Each market is rebuilding their marketing calendar to reflect these learnings and many others, so we can reignite our business momentum, but our first priority has been, and will continue to be safeguarding the health and safety of our people and customers. The trust the McDonald's brand has developed over the last 65 years is our most precious asset, and we will never put that at risk. We remain closely aligned with the expert judgment of scientific and government leaders in our various markets, and we support the focus on widespread testing as a central element to broader recovery efforts. Whatever the cadence of reopening markets, we know we can adapt. McDonald's is a remarkable system, and I am confident that the strength we have exhibited both before and during the crisis will be even more apparent as we emerge into a new post coronavirus world. I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk about our first quarter results.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. We began 2020 with strong top line momentum. Global comp sales were up 7.2% through February, reflecting strong performance in most countries around the world and the benefit of leap year. Beginning in mid March, consumer traffic began to decline significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as we temporarily closed some restaurants and shifted to limited operations in others when many parts of the world experienced government restriction and shelter in place guidelines. As a result, global comp sales were down 22% in the month of March and down 3.4% in the first quarter. Today, I will walk through March and April trends to provide perspective on how comp sales have progressed over the past few months. International operated market comp sales were down 35% for the month of March. In the second-half of March, comp sales were down roughly 70% as several markets like France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. temporarily closed all restaurants, and other markets like Australia, Canada, and Germany had drive-thru delivery and takeaway only for limited hours and menus. Comp sales have continued to be down about 70% through April in this segment as many of the fully closed markets are now just beginning to reopen.  Turning to the U.S., comp sales were negative 13% for the month of March. Beginning in mid March and continuing through mid April, U.S. comp sales were consistently down about 25%. However, we have begun to see some improvement in the last couple of weeks. We expect April comp sales to be down about 20%. Also over the last several weeks, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in average check across all channels. This is due an increase in party size as well as the evolving consumer behavior with daily routines interrupted and fewer transactions at the breakfast day part. Not surprisingly, the U.S. has also seen sales impacted on weekends more than weekdays as consumers leave their houses only when necessary, and we've seen a shift in sales mix by order channel as nearly all restaurants are operating drive-thru delivery and takeaway only. Prior to the impact of COVID-19, the drive-thru accounted for about two-thirds of all sales in the U.S. As consumers shifted from in-person ordering to drive-thru and delivery channels, drive-thru now accounts for nearly 90% of sales in the U.S. We're also seeing an uptick in delivery and digital transactions per restaurant, and all of these trends are similar to what we've seen in China and other markets. Comp sales in the International Developmental License segment were down 19% for the month of March similar to the other segments in the second-half of March, comp sales were down even more significantly reflecting the impact of COVID-19 as it spread throughout the segments. In China, approximately 25% of restaurants were closed in early February. By the end of March, substantially all restaurants had reopened. However, the market continues to experience a reduced level of demand as consumers have not fully returned to their pre-COVID routines, resulting in negative comp sales since the initial outbreak in late January. Comp sales were down over 20% in the first quarter, and trends have improved in April to negative mid-teens. In terms of new unit development, China opened over 100 restaurants in the quarter. We remain confident in new restaurant growth opportunities in China. However, we expect timelines to be delayed due to the crisis. I want to transition to some areas that are most relevant to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on our results, including flow through considerations on the P&L, corporate liquidity and franchisee financial health. Starting with the P&L, as we've become a more heavily franchise business over the last several years, our operating model is designed to tap into the entrepreneurial spirit of our local business owners and for efficient conversion of top line growth to the bottom line. In other words, as comp sales grow, the fixed nature of our franchise cost structure results in strong flow through to the bottom line. Inversely, in the current environment of declining sales, we see less flow through to franchise margin dollars. Our company operated restaurant expenses are more variable in areas such as food and paper and labor costs. So, the flow through to margin dollars is a bit better in our company operated restaurants in the current environment. For perspective in March with a comp sales of negative 22%, our total restaurant margin dollars declined $350 million, with about 75% of the decline driven by franchise margin dollars. Most of the decline was in the IOM segment due to the significant number of temporary restaurant closures. Turning to G&A, we saw an increase of about $95 million in constant currencies or 19% versus first quarter last year. About two-thirds of the increase relates to non-recurring costs, including $40 million for the cancellation of our biennial worldwide convention and roughly $20 million related to payments of contractual obligations as we reduced the scope and ongoing spend in R&D work of certain restaurant technology. The remaining increase relates to the run costs associated with our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, as well as continued depreciation and amortization costs related to technology. As a reminder, both of these acquisitions occurred subsequent to first quarter 2019. So we're not lapping those acquisitions yet. Our investment in digital customer engagement remains a priority for our business, and as I mentioned before, we've already seen the benefits of Dynamic Yield in our operating results. These digital investments enable us to give customers more choice and flexibility in how they order, pay and receive their food during this unprecedented time, and will remain important in serving customers as we think about our business beyond this crisis. As we navigate through uncharted waters, we're taking a disciplined approach to decision-making. This includes reviewing all investments and reducing or delaying spending as we re-scope priorities in some areas and redirect dollars to other priorities. We're focusing resources on projects and initiatives that can reasonably be implemented and executed in the near-term, both in terms of cost and time, and will also benefit the system for the long-term. As we make these assessments, we'll also prioritize our resources against the most critical needs of the business. Due to COVID-19, we expect a few lines of the other operating section of the P&L to be impacted in 2020 as well. Gains on restaurant sales are expected to be down about $100 million as a result of minimal restaurant sale activity for the rest of the year. Our equity and earnings of affiliates is expected to be down substantially, and we expect to have some additional reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals subsequent to March. The result of all of this is that we expect our operating cash flow to be down significantly this year. We entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet and we've taken a number of actions to preserve financial flexibility. In addition to currently reviewing our G&A costs, we suspended our share repurchase program in early March. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, including $5.5 billion of debt issuances at various maturities, and a new $1 billion line of credit that we drew upon immediately. In terms of capital expenditures, we've taken a very practical approach to development activity. We suspended experience of the future groundbreaking in the U.S. and new restaurant openings around the world as COVID-19 began to spread. Given that our first quarter CapEx is typically about 20% of the full-year and many projects are delayed or on hold, we now have some flexibility with decisions for the majority of our plan capital spend for the year. As a result, we're reducing our 2020 spending by about $1 billion dollars from our initial expectation of $2.4 billion. I also want to acknowledge our dividend. We paid our first quarter dividend at the beginning of March prior to the widespread impact of COVID. McDonald's remains financially strong and our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the business for growth and prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. We will continue to manage and utilize our funds in a judicious manner that focuses on ensuring the company is able to grow the business and our franchisees remain financially strong. As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to ensure that the company is in a sound financial position and to put our franchisees and developmental licensee partners around the world in a position to be successful in running their businesses. As COVID spread quickly around the world, our first step was determining operating procedures, resulting in temporary closures of all restaurants in some countries, and limited operations and others as I've mentioned. That was quickly followed by providing broad based financial liquidity assistance in the form of rent and royalty deferrals that were generally applicable to all franchisees within various markets, because we needed to make quick decisions to alleviate franchisee concerns and put them in the best position to maintain their businesses. Generally, we've deferred the collection of rent and royalties earned in March and April in most markets around the world. Cash is collected on a one month lag, so the cash impact of these deferrals occurs in April and May. This deferral amounts to roughly $1 billion of liquidity assistance that we committed to our franchisees and developmental licensee partners across the system. We also work closely with lenders, suppliers and distributors to extend payment terms to franchisees where necessary. Now we're assessing the financial health and liquidity of specific at risk franchisee and developmental licensee organizations. This assessment includes various sales projection scenarios, and takes into account the impact of liquidity assistance measures provided by the company, suppliers, lenders and governments. We've developed an objective framework for making decisions regarding which specific franchisee and deal organizations may need further liquidity assistance and how we may support them. This will help ensure a consistent and equitable approach to decision making across all of our markets. As Chris mentioned, our general philosophy for assistance to be timely, targeted, and temporary, the financial health and strength of our franchisees have been a competitive advantage for McDonald's for years, and we expect that to continue post COVID-19. Now, I'll turn it back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. While there is much we don't know about the future course of this pandemic, we are taking the necessary actions to ensure we will emerge from this crisis in a position of strength. Looking ahead, we know these unprecedented times will bring about some fundamental changes to the way businesses, including ours operate. What will remain constant is our commitment to maintaining the strong level of trust our customers have in the business, also beginning to think about our strategy in the aftermath of COVID-19. While elements of the Velocity Growth Plan will continue to be important, for making adjustments in real time, and there will likely need to be further changes, we'll look to provide updates on our overall progress later in the year. In these challenging times I'm immensely proud of the way our system has banded together and stayed true to our purpose to feed and foster community. The countless inspiring examples of this around the world showcase the real impact McDonald's has in the communities in which we operate. I'm proud to share a handful of these stories. In the U.S., our restaurants are offering our appreciation with free Thank You meal boxes to first responders and healthcare workers to thank them for their tireless efforts to protect us all. These include favorite breakfast and lunch menu items packaged in Happy Meal boxes, with a thank you note in place of a toy. We're in the middle of this two-week show of appreciation, and we've already provided nearly four million Thank You meals. Across Europe many markets are providing free drinks, coffee and meals to first responders and healthcare workers on the frontlines. In Madrid, a restaurant just reopened solely to serve frontline workers at the nearby hospital. In Australia, we've added staples of milk, eggs, and bread to our menus enabling customers to use McDonald's contactless Drive-thru and takeaway to shop for basics, providing a safe and easy way for customers to shop, and in many of the communities around the world that we call home extra food within the supply chain is being redistributed through nonprofit organizations and local food banks to feed communities in need. We've also donated nearly 1.5 million masks to COVID relief efforts. I said earlier we entered this crisis with a solid foundation. While we face significant disruptions and challenges, we remain confident in our ability to adapt as we've done throughout our 65 years to secure our long-term success. And now, we'll begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nMike Cieplak: Good morning. Our first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks and good morning. So far, in April, it sounds like the U.S. has seriously diverged from your trends in other international markets. So just focusing on those international markets, obviously a lot of that weakness has been closed stores, but I would also imagine that those would be more vulnerable to COVID type formats, like higher walk-in mix, and there might be other economic and structural factors that might linger. So can you give us a sense about how things look in those markets as you get back to reopening? And do you see the snapback as strong as it's been in the U.S.? And perhaps you can dig into that comment about the support you're offering to franchisees, especially in those hardest hit markets? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Morning, David. Thank you for the question. And you're right, in the international, particularly in our IOM markets in Europe, we have a number of countries that are completely closed based on government mandates. We are just beginning the process of reopening on a limited basis in a number of those markets. And so it's probably a little premature for us to give you any indication of what the overall trajectory is going to be, but I would say we've been really encouraged when we do start to open limited restaurants by the demand. You may have seen, in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets we had a three-hour wait at one of our restaurants, in France, for people to get through the Drive-thru. In Austria, we had a two-mile line of people looking to get into the Drive-thru. And I think our overall view is as markets start to open up this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known is very, very powerful. And I think the fact that we also have a strong orientation toward convenience and value that I think are also two key elements. We are optimistic. We certainly are expecting that we're going to be able to take share in those markets, and so I think we, like everybody else, are closely watching what the overall level of customer demand is going to be. We do feel like we're well positioned on that, but probably too soon to say. In terms of financial support that we're providing to franchisees, let me pass it over to Kevin to address.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, hey, David. Related to the franchisee assistance, I'd say it's similar to what we've done in the U.S., as I talked about in my remarks. At the beginning what we really did was kind of this broad-based assistance that was deferring a couple months of rent and royalties generally for most franchisees around the world. The other thing that's happened is essentially we've converted our rent to variable rent based on sales. So the restaurants that have been closed effectively aren't paying rent because they don't have sales. The only other thing I would point out is there's various different forms of government assistance in each country. So certain countries provide more assistance related to kind of workers who aren't working temporarily, which means that in some of the markets they've been able to effectively help the franchisees in terms of being able to keep their workers but not if that payment doesn't come out of the franchisee's pockets while the restaurants are closed. And then in several markets we've actually been working with other companies to actually even find places where employees have been able to work. So in a couple of them we partnered up with companies like [Aldi] [Ph] and others to provide temporary employment for our workers while our restaurants are closed. So I wouldn't say that our assistance is substantially different on the international side. Again, we started at the broad-based, and now we're looking at individual organizations to see where we may need to step in, both internationally and in the U.S.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. And I hope you all are staying safe and sheltered. Now that we're a month-and-a-half into the crisis domestically, I want to learn more about the best practices you are implementing into the U.S. that have been proven in international markets amid COVID-19. It seems like the sales improved, from down 25% to down 15% from the first-half of April to the back half of the month. What would you attribute to that improvement? Has there been part of the strategy that could lean more into around digital value or resume to advertising? What would you call it that maybe the improvement that you're seeing thus far is a result of stimulus checks and consumers growing more comfortable venturing outside the home, as a contributor? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, hey, Andrew. So maybe let me take it in two different pieces there. I think in terms of the best practices, we have learned a lot around how we adjust operations to really make sure that we're providing a safe environment for our crew and for our customers. And in almost every market where we operate, the U.S. included, there are dedicated teams that are meeting daily and reviewing procedures, and connected to our global Restaurant Solutions Group to understand these best practices. In the case of the U.S., they've made 50 different changes to operating procedures as we've learned more. And it's everything from positioning guides, to protective barriers, to other things like masks, how often, how frequently we are sanitizing surfaces; just a variety of different things. So that has been really helpful for us in terms of just making sure that our restaurants continue to be a safe environment for both customers as well as for our crew. I think that certainly does help with the demand that we're seeing. I think as people get confident about our ability to continue to offer food in a safe way, that certainly helps, but there is a benefit that I think you could attribute to the stimulus checks. I think there's probably also, as customers are starting to venture out a little bit more, this desire to really go to familiar brands. You saw it in the away from -- or in the at-home occasion, center of the store, familiar brands in grocery really benefited as people were staying home. I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands. So I think there's a variety of different things at play there in the U.S., but certainly we've been more encouraged by what we've see the last couple of weeks in the U.S.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks, and hope everyone is doing well. So, in the current environment, franchisee health is the big topic, and I understand the need to limit what you tell the public, but in the past you've given some detail on what's happened to franchisee cash flow. And it also seems like a lot of operators have increased their loads quite significantly to cover the remodels and tech upgrade. So the question is, are rent and royalty deferrals enough to prevent some of your bottom quartile franchisees from failing? And I think you alluded to this in the prepared remarks, but there may be some other options in the table. So if you could talk about what those might be for those troubled franchisees? And then secondarily, regarding the Cares Act and the PPP relief, would you be able to say what proportion of your stores actually qualify for some government assistance there? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, so I think what Kevin talked about, I'll talk just sort of philosophy and then give Kevin the handoff in terms of any more details, but the first phase of this crisis, essentially we wanted to move with speed. And so that was why we just pushed a lot of liquidity out into the system, both from what we did as well as what our suppliers did to just, in that initial phase, make sure our system had the sufficient liquidity. And that was a broad-based deferrals that Kevin referenced. Now, as we've had more time, we've essentially been able to go through and do stress tests, if you will, for every single franchisee organization, and have developed a sense of what we think their liquidity needs are under a variety of different scenarios in terms of how this business recovers. I think the important point that Kevin talked about in terms of the principles of timely, targeted, and temporary is we will provide the support when it's apparent that what the scenario is that we're dealing with. So that's the timing element which is who knows how any of this progresses, but we certainly have a sense of, depending on which trajectory we go, who is going to be at risk. And then I would say we have a full suite of tools at our disposal to address the situations, but Kevin, if you want to add anything to that?\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I'll just add a little bit. I guess, one, I would just remind everyone that we did come in to 2020 with most of our franchisees in most of our major markets either at or near all-time high cash flows, so most came into the year in pretty good strong position. To your point, there are some franchisees in some markets that are more highly leveraged, I'll say, than others. So we are cognizant of that and certainly are having the appropriate discussions with those franchisees. And to Chris' point, I think now we're at the point where we are looking at organization by organization, and seeing where we may need to step in and provide further assistance. Or make sure that they're getting all the assistance they need from lenders, suppliers, et cetera. Related to kind of the loans, I guess I would just remind everyone our operators are small independent business owners who are eligible for the loans. They're working with their advisors to determine kind of the needs for their business. Our understanding is that most have been able to get approved, and which would enable them to keep paying their crew and continue running their businesses. And then we're certainly continuing to working with them to make sure that they've got the liquidity to keep running their businesses. So I think we feel pretty comfortable in general about franchisees, but there certainly will be a few that need to just think about how they get further assistance if they need.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Hope everyone is doing well. Kevin, I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up to that last comment. Is there anyway to maybe bucket how many of those franchisees or what percentage of the system would fall into the category of you might need to offer additional assistance? And then, my second part of the question is really related to how you think the cash flows will shape up in the short run? If there's any metrics you can share in terms of cash burn rate for the second quarter, for example, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Thanks, David. It's a small percentage, I'll leave it at that, but it's a pretty small percentage. This is not a large majority of operators or a large piece of the operators. It's generally maybe a few operators in each market that we're working with. So it isn't a widespread issue that we're dealing with. Related to cash flow and let me try and put that in some context, and I'll go back and just -- I may repeat some of the things I mentioned in my remarks, but remember we entered the crisis certainly from a position of financial strength. From a corporate standpoint, we're obviously we have a strong investment grade credit rating. That's always been important to us. So we've been maintaining that, and I talked about our franchisees also entered into the year pretty strong financially. As we got into this year, and the impact of COVID was growing, you would have seen that we acted pretty quickly to bolster our cash position, certainly in anticipation of the changing macroeconomic and business conditions around the world. We secured $6.5 billion of new financing in March, which was about $5.5 billion of bonds and a $1 billion of line of credit, and then we also still have full access to a committed line of credit of $3.5 billion. So, I know cash burn is a frequent topic of discussion lately. We certainly keep our eye on that, but we do have confidence in our liquidity position based on our current cash balance and our ability to get further access if we needed in the markets. We ended the first quarter, a little over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet, and again, remember, we still have that $3.5 billion line of credit that's untapped if we ever should need it. I'd say our cash outflows right now are fairly consistent month-to-month for things like G&A and capital and lease expense costs in this big variable is the cash inflows because as you know, we operate in over 100 countries. We've given some of that those rent and royalty deferrals of over $1 billion, and now we're looking at those individual operator organizations that may need something further. Having said all that, between the temporary restaurant closures and the deferrals, our cash inflows certainly will be significantly less in the second quarter than normal. So we're likely to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter, but assuming that the countries continue to reopen on the schedules that we're seeing right now, and again, most of those are in the European markets, and assuming franchisees can have the ability to pay their rents and royalties, we would expect that the free cash flow would turn back to positive in the third quarter. So we do think second quarter will be a rougher quarter in terms of cash flow, but right now based on current plans, we would expect that to turn around back to positive in the third quarter.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask a bit more about sales trends both before and after the emergence of COVID-19. So, before in January in February, you noted that comp was balanced between traffic and ticket in the U.S., I guess if you could just talk a little bit about does that account for easier effectively, you haven't had positive traffic in the U.S. in a while, I try to understand what the drivers might have been, and then after the emergence of pandemic, you talked about global delivery sales being up significant, could you just quantify share of sales or year-over-year growth in delivery and maybe give some color on digital ordering, as well and presumably even some of the drive-thru orders or carry out would have been digital, so just a little bit more context before and after?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. So on your first part of the question with the U.S., we did get off to a really strong start. The team was very excited about the U.S. results through February. As you know, we were up over 8% for the first two months of the year, and a good amount of that was due to traffic. We were really encouraged by the traffic trends that we were seeing -- entering into the New Year and that excludes the extra benefits that we then got through leap year. So we were in a good traffic position through the first couple of months in the U.S. Leap Year further helps that and then, we had COVID and kind of the rest from there in terms of what we've been working through. I think from a delivery standpoint, the important thing is the vast majority of our business is still drive-thru driven in the U.S., and so, while delivery is up significantly, it's not the predominant thing that is driving our business. The predominant channel is really through the drive-thru. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add?\nKevin Ozan: No, but we certainly have seen some markets around the world like Canada, for example, delivery sales are up 40%, and so, part of it's dependent on the market and the -- I'll say the penetration of drive-thru, as Chris mentioned, certainly drive-thru in the U.S. has gone from two-thirds of our business to about 90% of our sales right now, but we certainly are seeing both delivery and digital sales up in the U.S. and then some markets thing it is seeing it up more than the U.S. even from pre-COVID times.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Just trying to get some historical context for whatever historical means in terms of COVID, but China seems like some good intelligence, just trying to assess the pace of recovery through the crisis. It seems like you mentioned it was down more than 20% from a comp perspective in the January, February timeframe. Wondering if maybe you could give some sort of a monthly trend is that market, I think you said is now down mid -teens. So it seemed like it's a five point plus improvement, but over multiple months, so it seems like maybe it's slower than summit hoped. Just wondering maybe if you can list out the primary factors looks like instead the U.S. is much more quickly improving. I think you said it started April down 25, and just within the month it's now adapt 15. So anything you can compare and contrast between China and the U.S. in terms of how we think about the recoveries around the world would be great? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. So I think there is - as you mentioned, there is a number of things that we're learning from China. A lot of it was around operational elements that I described earlier in the call. We've certainly also been watching and learning as China has been able to have approach the digital side of the business. I think they are further ahead than most of our markets in terms of how they use digital. So, a lot of good, but as you mentioned, as we've referenced as well, the pace of recovery in China has been slow. We're not seeing a V-shaped recovery in China. The business trends are improving, but they're still running negative to where we were a year ago. I think there is a couple things that are worth just noting as two reasons for that. The first is we had substantially more restaurants in China that were fully closed, and then have to reopen. So that's a larger disruption than if you're able to kind of continue to be open, and then just moderating your channels. So that was one issue. The second is just a reminder in China, only 15% of the restaurants have drive-thru, and I would say one of the things that we have seen as a real strength of our businesses drive-thru penetration, and so when you have a strong drive-thru penetration, I think your ability for that business, that market to get bounce back. That's certainly an added benefit. Kevin, anything else you want to add?\nKevin Ozan: I think those are the two biggest things. There are some consumer trends, I'd say that we're seeing similarly, which are weekdays recover quicker than weekends, as people start to go out again, breakfast is a little slower to recover than other day parts, and then, obviously, as we get into summer, that could still be impacted by things like reduced vacation, holiday travel, etc. So some of the consumer trends are similar, but to Chris's point. The big difference to me is that we've got much more drive through certainly in the U.S. and those restaurants remained open, whereas in China the restaurants are fully closed for a while.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks and good morning. On the IOM comp trends, a couple of questions, one is I know we can do the math, but just to be clear of the stores that are not closed, what are the comp trends in those in those markets? And you're just talking about China and Drive-thru and that's a critical differentiator in the U.S., for example, what percentage of the IOM markets have drive-thrus, what percentage are for breakfast? You know, it varies, but if there's an average or some anecdotes there, and then Kevin, just want to make sure to clarify your dividend comment. You said you're acknowledging the dividend. Does that mean that it's under review or it's not under review, just making clear what you said about the dividend in your decisions around that? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: So I'll start with just an overall comment about IOM in the European markets. It is tough to generalize I mean, I've got to say that every market is in a different situation based on what's happened from government mandates, just the overall orientation of that market, so difficult to generalize. Certainly, I think you can conclude that in the restaurants that are open, comp still down, comp down reflecting just a lower level of economic activity, people are still largely staying at home, even in markets that are able to remain open. So that is that is adversely affecting even in restaurants that are open comp trends, but again, it varies really market-by-market. I think. If you then go to your second question, which is about percent of restaurants, primarily in Europe, again, I'll focus there that have Drive-thru. The majority have our restaurants have Drive-thru? In Europe, it does vary market-by-market, but the majority of our restaurants do have Drive-thru. So that certainly is something that we expect to be helpful to us as we emerge out of this. And then Kevin, I'll flip the other questions over to you. Yes.\nKevin Ozan: Related to the dividend, John Yes, what I'm saying is I'm reiterating our capital allocation priorities, which is investing in the business for growth, which includes supporting franchisees weren't necessary and prioritizing the dividend because we know that's important to our shareholders. Our normal quarterly process just because of timing is that will provide a recommendation to the board later in the quarter for the second quarter dividend. So we haven't changed our normal process at this point. It's our ongoing process that we would go to the board and the next month or so with our recommendation for the dividend, so that that's still intact that process.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChris Carril: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So can you please provide some more detail on the flexibility you have a CapEx in any additional detail on what makes up the $1 billion reduction this year, and on the remaining domestic EOTF remodels that were in the pipeline for this year? Can you talk a bit about how franchisees are thinking about the timing of those remodels? Is the thought process to complete them as soon as feasible or are franchisees seeking to largely just delay beyond this year? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we've said we're going to reduce CapEx by roughly $1 billion dollars. Part of that or a chunk of that really our U.S. experience of the future projects. We've substantially reduced that those projects for this year. Now, to your point, I view that as soon as it's reasonably feasible to keep to keep going on those, many of the franchisees will want to continue doing those. We have gotten some requests even already for some franchisees to continue those projects. So I would expect a lot of those would get pushed into 2021, but I think the franchisees, and rightly so, want to understand that the business is back to operating, I'll say more normally, before they go invest substantial dollars and close their restaurants for a period of time also. So that's a piece of it. We were also reducing openings in many of the markets outside the U.S., again, partly because if you think about some of those countries, they've been closed for a period of time now. They're just getting back up and running now the normal operations, and so, the disruption of going and opening new restaurants right now at a maybe quicker pace probably isn't the right thing to do for a lot of the franchises there. So that pace will slow in 2020, but again, I think that's relatively easy to continue picking up, and we certainly still see opportunities for growth in most of those markets. So, it isn't the long term change in opportunity, but it is a pause in 2020 for a lot of that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the limited menu and streamlining that clearly for different reason today, but I think of in some cases where you had been doing that as a strategy thinking of Paris in particular, so how permanent might this be? And even if it's not, what are the learnings? And then if you could please just clarify for the U.S. the day part mix prior to this current situation. What is it now? And then if you expect it to be different going forward? Thank you very much.\nKevin Ozan: Hi, Nicole. Yes, so I guess I will take the easy one first which is breakfast is down relative to the other day parts, and that's consistent with everything we've learnt. It's consistent with what we have seen in markets like China. It's consistent with what we have learnt through the whole experience of the future closing and then reopening process. So, breakfast is down relative to the other day parts that we ordinarily have, and then\u2026\nChris Kempczinski: Menu.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, and limited menu, it's been interesting and it's a good question. So, we have gone to limited menu in the U.S. as well as a number of other markets. I think one of the things that each of the markets are thinking about is as you go back to more of a standard menu, do you immediately revert back to sort of everything that was on the menu? Or, does this maybe provide us an opportunity to do some things that get that balance right between margin, operational ease, speed of service et cetera? So, I think it's probably safe to say at this point that that is going to be a market-by-market decision, but I would say every market is thinking about does it make sense to go all the way back to where we were pre-crisis or maybe we want to go back in more of a staged way and add some items but not all items. So, stay tuned on that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Katie Fogertey with Goldman Sachs.\nKatie Fogertey: Great. Thank you, and hope everybody is well, and I wanted to dive into the breakfast point in a little bit more detail. We heard from small competitor of yours yesterday that the franchisers are going to be allowing franchises to take breakfast off the menu as it makes sense, and then there is a lot of competitive dynamics right now within that day part. So, I was hoping if you could contextualize the opportunities seen there and the competitive landscape, and how you are thinking about the economic sensitivity of breakfast, any disruptions around people's normal routine? And how you are prioritizing marketing to hopefully recapture that as people return back to work? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Sure. I think it's fair to say breakfast is a critically day part for us, and so, we are -- as we start to really get into the recovery phase, getting back at breakfast business is going to be critical for us. I think the point we are trying to make on breakfast is it takes time. It's a disruption to routines. Reestablishing those routines does take time, but we plan to be very aggressive and make sure that we get back the breakfast business. The breakfast business is a great part of our overall mix, and so, we are going to be putting a lot of effort against that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. There are some comments that were made in regarding you should be perhaps changing the way that we operate. I think is the words that you used and potentially you have further change that's coming in the relatively near term. I assume or it will be perhaps that's alluding to G&A and just the overall structure, and obviously, Chris, I think you are going to go to this exercise as a new CEO regardless, but how you feel about organizational structure or spend offices reporting lines, what have you, and if this is your kind of a catalyst to maybe make some changes of the near-term that you could have potentially considered over the much longer-term?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, I think our comments around how we operate is really been -- was geared more toward how we operate the restaurants, and the changes that we need to make as we're in the midst of this crisis, how many of those stay permanent? So I think the intent was really when we talk about how we think about things operating differently. It's about how our restaurants operate differently after that. Your other point though, which we did talk about is, and as I mentioned in my remarks, the world is going to look different coming out of this crisis, and we expect that many of those changes are going to be enduring, and so, part of the work that we're going through is really thinking about our strategy kind of in this post-COVID world. We've got a great foundation to build on with velocity growth plan, but I think it's probably fair to say that we're not just going to pick up the velocity growth plan playbook and kind of resume business as usual. There are going to need to be adjustments to that, and so, my team and I are planning on doing that work over the next several months as we start to formulate our point of view and determine what continues, what changes. We'll come back to all of you later in the year and give you more insight into that.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'll add on G&A, John, is we are certainly reviewing our investments. We're reducing or delaying some spending, reallocating some resources. So I think we're doing the things that people would expect us to do as far as certainly scrutinizing our spend, but at the same time, we also have, as I mentioned, we have a few kind of non-recurring costs, we have the cancellation of our worldwide convention that cost us about $40 million. We have some contractual obligations we needed to pay for stopping some R&D work, that cost us about $20 million, and then we also have an unusual dynamic where there's a portion of our people costs that are capitalized related to restaurant openings, and as we reduced our restaurant openings, less of those costs will be able to be capitalized. That will likely cost us another $30 million to $35 million of G&A. Now that's not additional cash, because we were paying those folks already, but it's the accounting of them, where it may end up in G&A instead of where it would have been capitalized on developments. So, we've got some offsetting things going on in G&A for the year.\nMike Cieplak: Thank you everybody for joining us. That will conclude the call.

The past 12 months continue to demonstrate what makes McDonald's different, the strength of our people, the might of our scale and supply chain, the agility of our system, the importance of local ownership operating in the communities we serve and the power of the McDonald's brand. Despite the many disruptions caused by COVID, it's clear from our performance that when the going gets tough, McDonald's gets going and our system's inherent strengths become even more apparent.  2021 was a record-setting year for McDonald's on many dimensions, and we used this momentum to lean into our competitive strengths and build further advantage. Guided by our strategic plan, Accelerating the Arches, we made significant investments behind our brand purpose to feed and foster communities while envisioning new ways for us to serve our customers, leveraging our growing digital capabilities. As a system, we are laser-focused on our MCD growth pillars.  In the first full year of the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we made great strides as we maximized our marketing, committed to our core menu, and doubled down on the 3Ds of digital, drive-thru and delivery to create seamless, memorable experiences for our customers. Our focus on the MCDs has driven broad-based growth in 2021. While we expect that 2022 will be a year of continued progress, we also anticipate that many of the challenges we experienced in 2021 will endure.  A surge in COVID-19 cases and a return of restrictions in many of our markets are creating uncertainty around the world, exacerbating labor shortages and supply chain delays. Additionally, rising consumer inflation levels are putting pressure on restaurant economics. Focusing on our foundational operations, expanding our growing digital advantages and continuing to put the health and safety of our customers and crew first will remain critical to executing on Accelerating the Arches this year.  And with strong average unit volumes and restaurant cash flows, the company and our franchisees are well positioned to withstand the pressures ahead. In fact, franchisee cash flows hit all-time highs in most of our top markets, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Japan.  I've said it repeatedly over the past 2 years, and I'll say it again. I have never been more proud of the commitment and leadership of our restaurant managers and crews. Through even the most difficult moments, they have continued to be strong, keeping our restaurants running while providing hope and inspiration and extraordinary service to our customers and our communities every hour of every day.  Because of our unparalleled scale and dedication of our entire system, our employees, franchisees and suppliers, 2021 was a banner year for McDonald's despite the continued disruptions caused by COVID. In addition to the franchisee cash flow performance I mentioned, we hit all-time highs for global system-wide sales of $112 billion; comparable sales growth in the U.S. of 13.8%, which represents over $5 billion of system-wide sales growth; and operating income of more than $10 billion.  To expand on how Accelerating the Arches drove success, let me pass it over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. As we've talked about before, the customer-focused actions we've taken over the past couple of years continue to drive strong top line momentum.  Our global comp sales were up over 12% in the fourth quarter or nearly 11% on a 2-year basis. As a result of these actions, we've gained QSR traffic share across most of our major markets since 2019. This is particularly evident within the International Operated Markets, where off-premise channels remain a significant competitive advantage in this fluid COVID environment.  Our IOM comp sales for the fourth quarter were nearly 17% or just over 8% on a 2-year basis, with strong 2-year double-digit growth in the U.K. and Canada and high single-digit growth in Australia.  Later in the quarter, we had stops and starts in markets like Germany and France, where elevated COVID trends and heightened government restrictions interrupted recovery.  Our U.K. performance was driven by continued growth in our delivery business and strong marketing featuring core menu items such as the Double Big Mac.  Canada also saw increased delivery momentum, with October being the strongest month of delivery sales to date. And a highly successful launch of MyMcDonald's Reward loyalty program drove significant digital engagement.  Australian consumers began to emerge from stay-at-home restrictions throughout the quarter. Our 30 Days, 30 Deals value platform was a strong contributor to comp growth for the quarter and drove app usage as we prepare for our loyalty launch in the first half of this year.  As I mentioned, there are still challenging operating conditions in Germany and France, but we remain confident about our market share opportunities. Germany continued to benefit from a strong third quarter rollout of loyalty as well as a digital advent calendar in December, accelerating both app adoption and digital sales in the market. And in France, we highlighted our core menu with the launch of our new premium chicken line, featuring wraps and the Chicken McBaguette.  In the U.S., we finished the year strong with comp sales up 7.5% for the quarter and over 13% on a 2-year basis. We saw positive comps across all dayparts, which are still benefiting from average check growth, driven primarily by strategic menu price increases. Our MCD pillars continued to drive U.S. comps as strong marketing efforts behind McRib and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich were complemented with digital adoption by our customers.  Digital growth remains a key driver of success in the U.S. Our loyalty program continues to build with digital sales growing month over month. Chris will share additional headlines on our digital strategy and success in a few minutes.  All of this top line growth has also fueled franchisee cash flows to record highs in the U.S. with average growth in 2021 of around $125,000 per restaurant, putting our franchisees in a strong position to weather the inflationary pressures Chris talked about earlier.  Turning to the International Developmental Licensed segment. Momentum accelerated in Q4 with comp sales up over 14% or 10% on a 2-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. Japan achieved its 25th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with strength across our delivery and digital channels, while our dinner daypart benefited from compelling value programs and the introduction of new menu items. Recovery in China, however, continues to be impacted by COVID-related government restrictions, which significantly disrupted the restaurant industry in the fourth quarter.  While comps were negative for the quarter, we expanded our digital presence with a successful year-end festival for app members, and we opened over 650 restaurants for the year.  Turning to the P&L. Company-operated margins, particularly in the U.S., were pressured for the quarter as a result of higher labor and commodity costs. G&A for the quarter increased 9% in constant currencies. As I've mentioned before, the increase was primarily driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense as a result of company performance significantly exceeding our plan for the year.  Foreign currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.03 per share. And after a tax rate of over 22%, which included some one-time items, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23 for the quarter.  For the full year, adjusted operating margin was 43.4%, reflecting higher restaurant margins across all segments and higher other operating income. Despite some of the P&L pressures I mentioned, top line results generated restaurant margins of over $12 billion for the year, an increase of over $2.5 billion.  Before I hand it back to Chris, I want to touch on CapEx and our free cash flow profile. Our overall capital spend for 2021 was a little over $2 billion, slightly lower than our original expectations, primarily due to the timing of projects.  With the improvements we've made to our business model over the last several years and the consistent strength of our global business, our free cash flow grew to $7.1 billion in 2021, an increase of nearly 25% over 2019. And free cash flow conversion was 94% for the year.  With that, I'll pass it back to Chris.\nChristopher Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. At McDonald's, we've long prided ourselves on the relationships we build with our customers. For decades, they relied on us to provide hot, delicious food with service that's fast, friendly and reliable. That promise is what keeps them coming back, and it's why we see every guest interaction as an opportunity to drive customer loyalty, whether through digital channels like our app, in-person at our restaurants and drive-thrus or off-premise through delivery.  While each pillar of our Accelerating the Arches strategy is formidable on its own, the real power is when the M, C and D come together in combination with the customer at the center. That's what's enabling us to continue to make customer-recognized progress as we did once again this quarter.  For starters, McDonald's continues to set a new standard for marketing in our industry. We're focused on taste, affordability, family and brand trust. And we've raised the bar on creative excellence with one of the most talented marketing teams in the world. Behind our marketing success is McDonald's iconic core menu. This quarter, we saw a strong performance that resulted in market share gains for both beef and chicken.  Our core classics aren't just the heart of our business. They're also a central part of our growth strategy. Iconic favorites like the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets and our world famous french fries drive almost 60% of our total business and about 75% of our food business, and we continue to make them better.  We've implemented enhanced cooking procedures in new buns in over 20 markets, including Australia, Canada and Russia, that result in hotter, fresher-tasting burgers. Customers have told us that they've noticed improved taste and quality, and we're excited to deploy these standards in most markets across the globe over the next couple of years.  To complement our leadership in beef, we're also focusing on growing our market share in chicken by leaning into the strength of core equities like Chicken McNuggets as well as creating the core classics of tomorrow. We've begun to make progress with new chicken sandwiches in the U.S. and many of our international markets. We've gained IEO market share in chicken in every single 1 of our top 11 markets since 2019.  And after a successful pilot of McPlant in 250 restaurants in the U.K., we're excited that McPlant is now available across all of our restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland.  Of course, being customer-driven is about more than just menu items. Our investments in technology and digital are paying off as our digital engine continues to make the customer experience more seamless and fuels growth in the process. Our top 6 markets saw more than 1/4 of their system-wide sales or $18 billion come from digital channels in 2021, a 60% increase over 2020.  We now have loyalty programs in more than 40 markets, including the U.S., Germany and Canada, each of which launched in 2021. And in the first half of 2022, we're excited to bring MyMcDonald's Rewards to consumers in the U.K. and Australia. We're well on our way to building the world's largest loyalty program.  Loyalty is the single biggest driver of digital adoption, and MyMcDonald's Rewards has exceeded expectations in terms of enrollment and participation. After just 6 months in the U.S., there are over 30 million loyalty members enrolled and 21 million active members earning rewards.  I mentioned earlier the importance of customer relationships. With loyalty, we're building on a strong legacy of meaningful customer relationships and driving greater customer engagement and reengagement. And in the first few months of our loyalty launch, we're seeing an increase in digital customer frequency of over 10%.  Moreover, strategic partnerships have been fundamental to our digital growth strategy. Dynamic Yield has been instrumental in bringing our drive-thrus and self-order kiosks into a new era for customer engagement. Last month, we announced that Mastercard will acquire Dynamic Yield. As part of our broader strategy to better scale our assets, our collaboration with Mastercard will help us expedite and integrate capabilities across ordering channels and across the globe to continue providing an even more personalized customer experience.  Delivery is a bet we made long before COVID and continues to be a staple for consumers. Our delivery footprint has expanded to more than 33,000 restaurants in 100 countries. And in the fourth quarter, our momentum continued with double-digit comps over strong growth in 2020. We've entered into new long-term strategic partnerships with 2 of our largest global delivery providers, Uber Eats and DoorDash. These multiyear deals are mutually beneficial and unlock tremendous value for our customers and franchisees, helping to ensure the long-term profitable growth of delivery. And as we integrate McDelivery into our app, we'll enable an even more seamless and personal customer experience.  Even as our digital and delivery engagement rises, the drive-thrus remain an essential channel, especially as customers seek safe, contactless access to McDonald's. We continue to see a higher percentage of sales in the drive-thru compared to pre-pandemic levels.  While average drive-thru service times have improved since 2019 across our top markets, service times slowed in 2021 in the U.S. and many markets compared to 2020. With industry-wide labor availability challenges, our market teams are focused on the foundational elements to maximize throughput, from staffing and positioning to new technology. Collectively, the investments we've made in our MCDs paid off in 2021, and we're confident they will drive even greater growth across the system in 2022 and beyond.  I'll turn it back over to Kevin to talk about our 2022 outlook. Kevin?\nKevin Ozan: Thanks. Looking ahead this year, as Chris said, we're confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth against an uncertain macro backdrop. We expect that our 2021 net new restaurant openings of about 2%, along with planned expansion in 2022, will contribute about 1.5% to our system-wide sales growth in constant currencies this year.  We're focused on increasing our overall operating margin over the long term, as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of operating performance. In 2022, we anticipate our operating margin percent will continue to be in the low to mid-40s range as strong top line momentum and minimal other operating income will be hampered by significant commodity and labor inflation in the near term.  We've seen our digital and technology investments over the past few years drive top line growth. As we continue to strategically invest in digital and technology, we're also carefully managing our G&A. In 2022, we expect G&A to be about 2.2% to 2.3% of systemwide sales. Beyond 2022, we expect to gain leverage on both G&A and operating margin through continued sales growth.  Based on current interest in foreign currency exchange rates, we're projecting interest expense this year to be relatively flat compared to 2021. And under current tax legislation, we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%.  Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS between $0.05 and $0.07 in the first quarter and between $0.18 and $0.20 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.  Transitioning to capital expenditures. We anticipate spending between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion this year. About 40% of this will be allocated to our U.S. business, where we expect to have net restaurant unit growth for the first time in a few years. Most of the U.S. spend will go towards reinvestment, including the completion of our restaurant modernization efforts. About half of our total capital spend will be dedicated to new unit openings. Globally, we plan to open over 1,800 restaurants, with more than 500 of these openings in the U.S. and IOM segments. The remaining 1,300 new restaurants, including roughly 800 in China, will be across the IDL markets, where our strategic partners provide the capital for restaurant openings. We anticipate net new restaurant growth of about 3.5% for the year.  We also expect our strong cash flow growth to continue in 2022. And after the CapEx spend I just talked about, we'll continue to convert more than 90% of our net income to free cash flow as we have the last few years.  Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to invest in new units and opportunities to grow the business, along with reinvesting in existing restaurants; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to repurchase shares.  It's during times like this that the strength of the McDonald's system and scale are more beneficial than ever. And I remain confident that our strategy will continue to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for our system and shareholders.  Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close.\nChristopher Kempczinski: Ray Kroc built McDonald's as both the most independent and interdependent brand on the planet. From the beginning, Ray wanted the McDonald's franchise model to be a two-way street. In doing so, he unleashed the creative power of franchisees who had ownership in their businesses. Together, we have built a brand that is second to none. We see the power of that brand every single day. We see the power of the brand reflected as part of the cultural fabric and communities around the world. We see the power of the brand in the value of restaurant ownership and the strong cash flows that our franchisees are experiencing. Most of all, we see the power of the brand in the ways our thoughtful decisions and investments have resulted in our collective strength today. It enabled us to build an unrivaled customer experience where modern restaurants and innovative digital technologies serve more than 65 million customers every single day.  Now as we prepare to come together with our franchisees in April for the first time in 4 years at our worldwide convention in Orlando, we will celebrate the McDonald's brand and talk about how this generation of system leaders will put their own shine on the Arches. The answer will certainly be rooted in how we create a more seamless customer experience that connects the physical restaurant to our digital channels. But it will also be based on one of our founding principles in the model: building a business that is representative of our customers and communities, where equity to opportunity is central to our business.  We cannot let economic or other barriers stand in the way of bringing the best talent into the system. As part of our brand's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and we're demonstrating this commitment in various ways throughout our system, including a mutual DEI pledge for suppliers, incorporating human capital metrics into annual compensation for senior leaders and a commitment to equal pay for employees.  Last month, we were proud to announce a franchisee recruitment initiative focused in 3 areas: recruitment, financing and ongoing learning and development. Our goal is to create opportunities and increase the number of new franchisees from all backgrounds, including women and historically underrepresented groups in McDonald's operated markets around the world.  I'm excited and optimistic about the months and years to come. Together as a system, we will continue to bring Ray Kroc's vision for collaboration to life while providing customers the food they crave, the experience they treasure and the brand they love. It's this commitment that will accelerate the Arches while helping us feed and foster communities everywhere.  Thank you. And with that, we'll take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Kevin, this quarter is a little different that the formal outlook in the 8-K did not provide a 2022 system sales outlook. And usually, you guys provide some commentary around the forward quarter and around how you see sales and margins progressing. And I recognize that media reports 2 weeks ago, around a 10% reduction in operating hours due to staffing challenges, is probably presenting some lack of visibility.  But if you just help level set what are you seeing out there at the start of January, just given the staffing dynamic? And kind of how you see the potential for U.S. sales progressing over the course of 2022, just given the [indiscernible] you saw last year as the strategy really is working.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Let me start with some of the sales commentary, and then I'll let Chris talk about the 10% labor thing that you were talking about because that came out of a discussion that Chris was having.  First, I guess, let me say that as things hopefully are starting to stabilize a little bit with some of the stops and starts, I think our thinking is to go back to some of our practices from pre-pandemic and not focus a lot of commentary guidance on current quarters. So we're going to try and go back and not give a lot kind of in current month.  But what I would say is we're really pleased with our 2021 performance in the U.S. You heard, both in the prepared remarks as well as seeing in the release, the U.S. put up its highest annual comp basically in our history. We have really good momentum as we start going into 2022. Our franchisees are very strong financially. Their cash flow has grown over 50% over the last 3 years. So from a U.S. sales perspective, we feel really good.  The focus in 2022 is going to be in a few specific areas. It's on chicken, where we want to continue our market share gains that we've been experiencing. It's on digital and loyalty. You've heard about kind of the beginning of the loyalty program, and we think that still has considerable runway to grow. And it's on operations execution in the restaurants, which is really about kind of our people practices as well as service.  So I think going into '22, we feel really bullish on kind of the U.S. momentum in the business where we are right now. Our franchisees are working hard. There are still some challenges from the labor perspective, but the restaurants are running pretty well, and we feel good about sales opportunities this year.\nChristopher Kempczinski: Yes. And I would just add, our franchisees have done a phenomenal job working through what is a really challenging staffing environment. Omicron certainly didn't make that any easier. But as of this week, we are now down to only about 1% of our restaurants in the U.S. are operating with limited hours. So franchisees have been able to make significant progress in ensuring that they've got the staffing that they need. And we actually are exiting 2021 with our roster size, the average number of people that work in the restaurant. Our roster size at the end of '21 is greater than where we were entering into the beginning of the year. So franchisees, again, have done a nice job, but it certainly is challenging. I think we're in a good place, though, in terms of having the vast majority of our restaurants, 99% of them, operating now with normal hours.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: A couple-part question here on the unit growth outlook. One, I just wanted to get more perspective from you on what's driving the big uptrend here in openings? And whether there's certain markets you'd call out as particularly strong in terms of the outlook?  And then secondly, Kevin, if you could just explain a little bit why a 3.5% unit growth number for this year would only translate to 1.5% of system sales. And I understand there's some mix impacts on that with respect to IDL, but was curious to sort of understand the dynamics there and what perhaps the run rate contribution to system sales would be from that type of growth?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. I hope I caught all the parts. Let me try. So I think we've said, for 2022, our unit growth will be about 3.5%. And that -- it's really -- if you think about it, it's more -- the current year sales growth is really driven more by prior year unit growth than current year, but obviously, current year has some impact.  So we've said last year is about 2% unit growth plus what we're opening this year will give us about 1.5% of sales growth. Part of that is -- most of that is mix.  I mean, if you think about where we're opening, we said about 800 of those openings are in China. Those are generally open up at a little lower volume certainly than either the U.S. or our European markets. And so that drives the difference between unit growth rate and the contribution of system-wide sales.  Going forward, post 2022, our expectation is of unit growth of about 3.5% to 4%. That will give about 2% contributions -- contribution to system-wide sales growth. And again, same dynamic where a chunk of those openings will be in China and a little bit lower volume.  I would say the other places where we are opening, besides accelerating China, are in most of our large markets. That's Canada, France, U.K., Australia and even the U.S. We believe there's still significant opportunity to grow units in our major markets, and we earn really good returns on those new openings. So from our perspective, it's a very good use of capital. And so that's what we'll see going forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: I think you mentioned $125,000 increase in the store level cash flow in the U.S., which I think puts you around $500,000 per unit, if I'm not mistaken. So obviously, there's some overearning that occurred in the early part of the year, and 4Q's run rate was likely seasonally lower given the company on margin. So can you talk about how much of that you expect to hold on to in 2022? And what you're seeing right now in terms of commodity and labor inflation? And how pricing -- how much pricing is in the system?\nKevin Ozan: Okay. There's definitely a lot in there between cash flow and commodity and pricing. Let me try and hit a few things there. Let me start with the cash flow perspective because we did say our cash -- unit cash flow is up about $125,000 for the year. Again, looking over a 3-year period, it's up about 50%. It does get to over $500,000 on an individual restaurant basis.  It is fair to say, to your point that, there is commodity pressure going into 2022. Just to give a perspective, in 2021 in the U.S., our food and paper costs were up about 4% for the year. If we look forward to 2022, our expectation is that will be about double or in high single digits increases for 2022. Most of that pressure or more of that pressure will be in the first half of the year. And as the year progresses, we expect that to ease somewhat.  On the international side, just to give a similar perspective, we saw about a 3% increase in food and paper costs in 2021, and that increase is supposed to be around double also in 2022, similarly more pressured early in the year.  So there is some pressure, certainly, again, more early in the year, on margins and therefore, on cash flow also. We certainly don't expect it to wipe away what we gained either in 2021 or prior to that. But it certainly will pressure, again, both margins and cash flow.  From a pricing perspective, our franchisees, I think you know they obviously decide pricing for their individual restaurants. They're advised by a third party, and the pricing mechanism or methodology that's used is a consumer-based research approach. We take into account market conditions, economic environment, competitive landscape, et cetera, generally try and take small increments of pricing at various times versus take a lot at one time.  And really, the most important thing that we're trying to balance is cost pressures with making sure that we provide good value to our customers and that our customer ratings on value remain high. We do keep a close eye on that. Our customer ratings have continued to score well on the idea of providing good value for money, and that's a really important metric for us because, obviously, a lot of our customers are looking to make sure that they're getting value as inflation rises. So that's some of the pricing dynamics that go on.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: I wondered just on loyalty, if you think about -- how you think about that impacts sales in the various markets in '22? Is there a way to quantify early on what you've seen in later stages of '21 in the U.S., for example, or earlier markets, like for example, France, where you've had loyalty for a number of years, maybe as a benchmark, how has that contributed to their sales growth as we think about how that may benefit the system in '22 and beyond?\nChristopher Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, John, it's Chris. We're excited about what we're seeing with loyalty. I think two things for us get us excited about it. The first is we are seeing that our consumers who end up going into the loyalty program, their satisfaction with McDonald's is stronger. And so for us, that's important because what it says is we're providing something of value to them, not just any of the offers or rewards that they might be able to get, but they're also enjoying the personalization and the feeling that we are, through loyalty, able to deliver them a MyMcDonald's experience. So that's the first point.  The second point, and we've talked about this in the past, is that with a brand like ours where you have reach of, call it, 80% or so in our biggest markets, that the power of loyalty is about being able to drive frequency. And so for us, we are seeing nice frequency benefits as we are able to deploy loyalty about 10%, as I made in my comments. And so what that ends up doing in terms of contribution of comp is a function of just how quickly we can bring on active monthly users. And that's the focus, finding programs, finding ideas where we can get more of our customers coming into our restaurants engaged as active users in loyalty. And to the degree that we're successful in that, the contribution of comp will be bigger, but we're excited about what we're seeing.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Chris, just a follow-up on the loyalty piece. And I guess thinking more broadly about digital within the U.S. this year in general. As far as sort of the digitization of the drive-thrus, some of the other digital focus that you mentioned earlier and where that can go this year and beyond. Is the general view that the contribution to sales and then, maybe even over time, to cost savings, managing margins, does that continue to increase to the gains that we saw in '21 get further even in '22, given your focus and given the investment in addition to, again, the loyalty answer that you kind of just addressed?\nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. We definitely see digital more broadly as the long-term macro trend that's going to affect our business. We're now at about 25% of our business is through digital channels. I think that number is going to continue to grow. We have some markets where that number is north of 50% of the business, like in China, like in France, others are very close, like in the U.K. where it's right at about 50%. So digital for us is a long-term play.  It's part of why, as you know, earlier last year, we made a move to create the Global Chief Customer Officer, because I think our opportunity is to meld more seamlessly the physical experience with the digital experience. And I think that's a big part of what Manu and his organization is going to be able to do. So for us, we're excited about what digital can do.  And I do think that there's -- right now, there's a lot of focus on what it can do for the customer experience. But as you digitize more of your transactions, I do think it opens up opportunities on the operations side as well. And so for us, this is going to be something we'll be talking about for years to come.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. We're going to move on. Our next question will be from -- are you there, Jared?\nJared Garber: Yes. Sorry about that. I had a phone issue. I wanted to ask a question about unit growth. Obviously, the franchisee free cash flow seems really strong, so not a demand issue. But wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of maybe the construction environment with respect to labor and staffing or permitting or equipment availability and supply chain?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. It's a fair comment. I think in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that our CapEx was a little -- for 2021 was a little bit lower than we originally had anticipated, and it was really just due to timing of projects more than anything.  I think it is fair to say that everything is taking a little bit longer, I'd say, than how it used to. That's from permitting to getting supplies and construction materials to dealing with labor issues at construction firms, et cetera. And so we did see some of that in 2021.  My sense is it's starting to get a little bit better, but there -- it's still not back to where things were pre-pandemic. So everything still is taking a little bit longer from permitting to construction to getting all of the equipment and technology that we need for opening and remodeling restaurants.  But the guidance we've provided related to both CapEx and openings, we feel pretty good about both of those, but we'll keep an eye on those as the year progresses to make sure that it's kind of advancing the way we expect right now from a supply chain perspective.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Just wanted to follow up on the inflation and pricing commentary, and I appreciate the color you gave on commodities. So just shifting a little bit more to labor. I think you mentioned you're now down maybe only 1% with stores reduced operating hours in the U.S. I know the comment a couple of weeks ago was 10%. So I'm just wondering if you can provide some color on that improvement and whether you still expect another year of maybe 10% inflation in '22, similar to '21.  And as it relates to that, just the pricing, if there's any more color you can provide in terms of elasticity. I think you were running 6% price in '21, which I think would be above your historical comfort zone. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are for '22, whether there's any concern about affordability on the lower end.\nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. I'll address a couple of those, and then I think Kevin will pick up on a couple as well.  So in terms of the progress that we've made, I would point out, the 10% number that I referenced was -- when I actually had that comment, that was middle of December. And we were in peak Omicron. I know the report on that came out later. But actually, the time I had that interview, that was mid-December. So we've had about 6 weeks or so, call it, 5 weeks of ability to continue to work away on the staffing side. And that's where, again, our franchisees have done, I think, just a terrific job of finding ways to get the talent that they need into the restaurants to keep the restaurants running. And so that is where we're now at, which is this 1% of restaurants with limited hours.  I think for us, part of what we've needed to do in 2021 to be able to leave the year with expanded roster size, as you've certainly seen that there has been labor inflation. And we announced, as you know, back in April of last year, a move from McOpCos, where we were going to take up the average wage in McOpCos, we are -- had about low teens, I'd say, increases at that point. We went up probably a tick higher as the year progressed on that in McOpCos. And our franchisees similarly saw inflation, call it, in the mid-teens from a labor standpoint.  One of the things that we also did though, and I think Joe and the U.S. team did a lot of good work with our franchisees on this, is talking about our employee value proposition, and beyond wages, other things that we can be doing to make sure that we've got the best proposition to get people in our restaurants. Things like paid time off, Archways and what we do around tuition reimbursement. And just a focus on making sure the reward and recognition is there. All of those things cumulatively, wages, focus on the employee value proposition and just engaging with the crew is what allowed us to make the progress.  As you go into this year, we are expecting that there is going to continue to be pressure on wages. Certainly, as we're thinking about our pricing, we're thinking about how do we put pricing that can anticipate that, but I'll let Kevin tell you more on that.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. So to Chris' point, we had kind of this onetime, if you will, adjustments or concerted effort to adjust people's wages. Right now, there isn't a specific plan to have a onetime event like that in 2022. But what we do need to do is continue to make sure that our folks are being paid at a similar level compared to industry, as the intent was last year. So that will continue to have some pressure, but we won't have kind of the onetime big bang, if you will.  From a pricing perspective, in the U.S. in 2021, consistent with what I had been saying kind of for the first 9 months, we ended up with pricing for the year a little over 6% or so. Again, that was to deal with the 4% commodity price increases or food and paper increases we had as well as labor inflation and just the competitive environment. That was relatively similar to where food-away-from-home was for the year in 2021.  And the positive from our perspective that we keep an eye on is do we see flow-through to sales in line with what we've historically seen? And we have continued to see kind of that flow-through of 70% to 80% of those price increases kind of taking hold. So that's where we keep a really close eye on as we take price increases. We look at 2 primary things: one, how customers are reacting both from customer research as far as how they view value as well as whether they're still coming from a transaction standpoint. And then two, just understanding where we are versus the competitive environment and cost pressures. And so that's the way we'll continue to look at it as we go into 2022.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: What percent of your purchases in the U.S. were loyalty users in the quarter? And just bigger picture, ultimately, what is your goal with your loyalty mix? What's going to get that active loyalty user rate to step change much higher? Is that customer ID at the drive-thru or other tools? And maybe give us a sense of the future of where you see loyalty going.\nChristopher Kempczinski: Yes. So that's a good question. It's one I haven't gotten before in terms of the actual percent of consumers that were loyalty consumers. I think probably maybe a different way. I don't know precisely that number. But I would say, right now, when you look at app usage in the U.S., which probably for me is the best proxy that we have. Most of our app usage, I think we certainly see people opting in for the loyalty program when they do that. And so app usage is right now running in the mid-single digits on that number right now. So I think that's probably as good a proxy as I can give you for the percent. But certainly, that's something that Mike and the team on Investor Relations can follow up with as well.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nSara Senatore: A question about margins and sort of related pricing. The couple of commentary you made about like G&A leverage and expecting to drive operating margins higher. So I guess, part one, is that an allusion to the idea that maybe the low to mid-40s is no longer the right range? And specifically in G&A, should it be lower than 2%, which I think was kind of your previous expectation. Are we -- or should we think about that range as still in place, but maybe towards the high end?  And the related question is, given how strong your cash -- your franchisee cash flows are, given how strong your performance is, is now the right time to instead of taking price to press that advantage? And I know you said that you're seeing what you expect in terms of elasticity, but is there any thought to kind of really, I guess, turning the screws on competitors with respect to your ability to price aggressively?\nKevin Ozan: Let me start with the last one, and then I'll come back to the first part on the pricing.  So one of the things we do certainly keep an eye on is what we've been talking about and focused on here is kind of what the increase is. But we certainly look at kind of our absolute prices compared to competitors. And even with those price increases that I talked about in 2021, we are still pretty well positioned versus our competition when you look at it by competitor, by item, by every which way you would think about.  And so again, what helps us from a research standpoint is the way consumers view value and the perspective of value. And I think in 2022, that will continue to be really important as inflation is hitting customers potentially harder than it's hit people in a long time. And so we're very cognizant of making sure that our value proposition continues to be strong. And so we do look at kind of absolute pricing compared to just increases also.\nChristopher Kempczinski: Yes, I would just add, I talked about this on the last call. I mean, in the U.S., we've had several years where we have been outcomping the industry. And as we go into 2022, we are in a share-taking mentality. as you noted, we are in a very strong position. And so my message to the U.S. team is about continuing to find ways for us to create further separation between us and the competition, because I think we are relatively at an even better position on that.  How they go about doing that? Value can be one component, but there are other things as well. But certainly, our aspiration and expectation in this year is we are going to continue to take share.\nKevin Ozan: And on the operating margin and G&A point, I think in our investor meeting, fall of 2020, if I remember correctly, it was, it seems like ages ago at this point. We talked about operating margin in the mid-40s. Right now, we're -- low to mid-40s. Right now, that's where we've been both for '21 and the guidance we're giving for '22. '22 is being, I'll say, pressured a little bit from all of the inflationary pressures that we've just talked about. Once those, God willing, normalize, I think we expect to certainly continue to get leverage on that operating margin. Because while this is all going on, we certainly expect to continue increasing -- to increase sales.  So I think '22 is being held back a little bit by, look, unusually high inflation pressures, both on the commodity and labor side. And in our mind, to be able to still remaining at that mid -- low to mid-40s range during those, to us is a really good sign that we feel good about when we come out of that inflationary environment that we'll be able to certainly get leverage on that.  Same with the G&A side. We -- the 2.4% that we were of sales in 2021 was driven by incentive compensation. We've been talking about 2.4% of sales for most of the year, which is where we came in. But then to continue getting leverage and go back to around 2% to 2.3% for this year and then continue to get leverage on that as we grow sales, in our mind, will also help the operating margin leverage.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: So on menu innovation, you recently announced the menu hacks promotion, so innovation without adding anything new. Can you talk about your philosophy around innovation this year? How you're thinking about the frequency of new items given added SKUs and wanting to limit complexity?  And then somewhat related, how do you see value playing a role in '22? I know it's come up a bit. But what are you seeing in the overall competitive environment given the pullback in discounting we've seen over the past couple of years?\nChristopher Kempczinski: So for -- as we think about innovation, if you go back to kind of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, the C of the MCD is about core menu. And I think our focus needs to be on continuing to drive our global core because those are our most powerful equities. They're ones that we see a lot of consumer excitement about.  An interesting thing that we've learned through the pandemic and just the latest on consumer sentiment, the vast majority of consumers, call it, still 80% or so of consumers in our top markets, are saying that they are still looking to buy products that they are familiar with. And so that consumer psyche, I think, plays well to our global core menu.  What I love about the hacks, what I've loved about the Famous Orders, we're finding ways to create news without adding complexity into the restaurant. And so I think you're going to see us continuing to do that as kind of a primary focus area.  That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be innovations that we do with new menu items, limited time offers. Those are certainly part of what keep the consumer excited and can help drive frequency. But I think we need to stay focused on driving core menu and creative ideas like the hacks ideas, just one way to go about doing that.\nKevin Ozan: And then on the value side that you brought up, again, talking about the U.S. specifically. Right now, we still have D123 as our nationally advertised value platform in the U.S. but that's really complemented and carried a lot through local fields. There's a localized approach that allows the local co-ops to kind of determine the value proposition for their local field based on local preferences, et cetera. That's particularly important at the breakfast time. So you'll see a lot of local value being driven by the local co-ops.  And then you will see -- on a national level, you'll still see a couple or a few times a year, nationally pulsed-in deals like we recently had 2 for $6. My hope is the environment, the competitive environment, remains where it's been, which has been relatively healthy from a value perspective, not crazy discounting, et cetera. We haven't seen any of that for a while. And so our intention is not to do anything dramatically different than what you would have seen in 2021.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChristopher Carril: So can you expand a bit more on what you're seeing from a throughput perspective? I think you mentioned service times, while still better than 2019 levels, did slow in '21. And how do you think about balancing further menu innovation and other strategic initiatives with opportunities to improve service times from here?\nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. We did see a little bit of a step back in service times because of the -- I think, the operating environment, that the challenges of just making sure that we have the staffing that we need. And as we head into this year, I think every market -- we've had conversations in the last several weeks, every market is laser-focused on opportunities that we can have to get back to sort of continuing to make progress on reducing service times.  The reason that that's so important is when we reduce service times, we see customer satisfaction go up. And so that is something that we're all focused on.  I think the other thing is, as we're able to open more service channels, and I'll use the dining room as an example, that takes pressure off of channels like the drive-thru. We put extraordinary pressure on the drive-thru as we had some dining rooms closed in 2021. Right now, in the U.S., about 80% of our restaurants have the dining room open. Expectation is that more of those will continue to open.  As we're able to do those things, as we're able to make sure that we've got the staffing at the size that we need and with the predictability that we need, I think the expectation is we're going to see service times start to come back down. And again, we are -- versus 2019, we're better off than where we started in 2019, but we think there's opportunity for us to continue to be showing progress on that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: My question relates to the IOM segment. And obviously, there's a lot of several important large markets that make up this segment. But can you update us on how much market share, you believe, you've taken in the overall IOM segment since the beginning of COVID? And what's been the primary drivers of these share gains? And how does it frame how you think about the potential strength of the IOM business in a post-COVID world?\nChristopher Kempczinski: I'll take it, and then Kevin can fill in. But I think as you mentioned, there's a lot of different markets in IOM, and it's always a little bit of a challenge to talk about them in the aggregate. But I think it's fair to say that we've taken significant share across those groups of markets. And we had a lot of momentum that was going into the pandemic in IOM. While certainly, these markets have been hit particularly hard through COVID, we're seeing that they're continuing to outperform by a pretty significant measure their competition.  And so for us, as you think about then rolling out of things like shutdowns that we're dealing with in Australia, we've had to deal with some of those things in Canada. Germany has been impacted. As we start to move through those, I think the momentum and the health of our franchisees is going to allow us to continue to take share, and then it's going to be taking share off of a more normalized comp environment.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. The only thing I'd add is, I mean, to your point and to Chris' point, obviously, IOM is a conglomeration of several different markets. So the markets are in different places. Markets like U.K., Canada have been really strong even throughout the pandemic, whereas some markets like France and Germany are still more in recovery mode.  I'd say we expect 2022 to -- again, I'm assuming no more stops and significant restrictions. But assuming that, that is the case, I think our expectation is that as we progress through the year, we will see the markets that needed to recover, recover nicely through the year, and the markets that have been doing well continue to be strong. And as Chris mentioned, most of the major markets have gained share throughout the pandemic. And so we, again, hopefully are coming out of the pandemic in a really strong place in substantially all of those markets.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Kevin. Everyone, have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-27 13:08:09", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Third Quarter 2021 Investor Call.

As the largest restaurant business in the world, our size and scale are a competitive advantage that we've built and nurtured for over six decades. Our 40,000 restaurants in over 100 countries are predominantly run by local owner operators, connecting the business to the 40,000 communities in which we operate. These local connections embed a level of agility that complements our size and scale, enabling local teams to adapt and adjust to operating conditions that vary by country, community, and even restaurant in real-time.  It's what makes McDonald's special. It's also how we're able to use scale and agility, how we can be both big and nimble to achieve something truly unique. And thanks to the resilience across all three legs of our stool: franchisees, suppliers, and the Company, and the scale and agility that we deploy collectively, I'm confident in our ability to meet whatever challenges may confront us, from restrictions driven by new COVID variants to supply chain pressures and labor shortages across industries to any other unknown unknowns. We're approaching the one-year anniversary of accelerating the Arches, which took shape in response to changing customer needs early in the pandemic. Rooted in the inherent strengths of the McDonald's system and brand, it's proving to be the right strategy with the right focus at the right time. We're evolving the customer experience in ways both large and small to meet changing customer needs and maintain our market leadership. Our three growth pillars known as our MCDs, marketing, core menu, and the 3Ds of digital, delivery and drive-thru, guide our business. This includes amplifying contactless channels like delivery and drive-thru, and creating digital experiences that are seamless, personalized, and easy to use. We've continued to make excellent progress this past Quarter, and I want to thank the McDonald's people all over the world who are performing under trying conditions. Let me turn it over to Kevin to walk through our top line results.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. Our third quarter top line results represent a continuation of our broad-based business momentum around the world, with global comp sales up nearly 13% or 10% on a two-year basis. Our international operated markets have continued to recover, accelerating two-year comp trends in the third quarter to nearly 9% as most markets operated with fewer government restrictions. There's still varied performance across the big five markets within the IOM segment, ranging from strong double-digit two-year growth in the UK and Canada to low-single-digit two-year growth in Australia, Germany, and France, as those countries have been slower to recover from the pandemic. The UK continued to lead the segment in the third quarter, driven by growth in delivery and digital channels, as well as strong menu and marketing promotions like Monopoly. In Canada, the strong two-year comp momentum was driven by successful marketing activity, including core extensions like the Grand Mac and spicy nuggets and growth in the 3Ds of drive-thru, delivery, and digital, even as dine-in restrictions have lifted. In France and Germany, comp sales exceeded 2019 levels for the first time in the third quarter.  Germany 's positive performance was supported by expanded deployment of delivery, the national launch of our loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards, and a taste of McDonald's promotion featuring value offerings like McChicken. France benefited from continued strength in delivery and strong menu and marketing promotions with a focus on family. Market conditions are challenging with the adoption of vaccine past restrictions for both customers and crew in France and several other countries.  Performance in Australia was impacted by significant stay-at-home restrictions, affecting over half of the restaurants for nearly the entire quarter. While comp sales were relatively flat for the quarter, the market was positive on a two-year basis and continue to grow its delivery channel, achieving record delivery sales for the quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the IOM segment to maintain a relatively similar two-year comp trend as Q3. In the U.S., we maintained our momentum with Q3 comp sales up nearly 10% or 14.6% on a two-year basis. We continued to see positive comps across all dayparts on a two-year basis, with sustained double-digit comps at dinner and breakfast.  At the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record high restaurant cash flow. Our U.S. franchisees have never been better positioned to weather the labor and inflation pressures while still investing in growth. Performance in the U.S. remains driven by strong average check growth, reflecting larger order sizes and menu price increases. The big bets we've made during the pandemic are paying dividends across the business and enabling us to maintain our QSR leadership.  Menu and marketing efforts with products like the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and successful famous orders like the Saweetie Meal have elevated our brand and help drive underlying sales growth across the business. The launch of our loyalty program in the U.S. has exceeded expectations and is driving increased digital adoption. In just a few short months, we already have over 21 million members enrolled, with over 15 million active loyalty members earning rewards, and we expect that number to continue to grow. Chris will share more loyalty headlines in a few minutes.  We've reopened nearly 80% of our dining rooms in the U.S., roughly 3,000 dining rooms remain closed in high-risk COVID areas as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and crew. In restaurants, where we have reopened dining rooms, front countering kiosk sales remained below pre-pandemic levels. But we're seeing that even modest increases in these channels helped to relieve operational pressure in the drive-thru. The strong performance in the U.S. has continued into October. We're currently seeing low double-digit comps on a two-year basis, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the fourth quarter. Turning to the International Developmental License segment. Comp sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter, or about 5% on a two-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. Japan maintained momentum in Q3, with comps up 13%, achieving an impressive six consecutive years of quarterly comp sales growth, despite restaurants operating with government restrictions.  The market's performance is being driven by a continued commitment to serve customers safely and conveniently through our drive-thru and digital channels, as well as strong marketing and limited time promotions. China continues to be impacted by both COVID resurgences, which restarted in June and lasted throughout the quarter, and a softening economy. While comps for the quarter were negative, the market continues to build its digital presence as they now have over a 100 million active digital members. In addition, we've accelerated new restaurant growth in China. With over 500 new restaurants already opened this year, we now expect to open roughly 650 restaurants for the year, exceeding our original plan. China remains a critically important market for us, and one where we have confidence in the long-term opportunity. So, we plan to get even more aggressive in opening new restaurants in this market. With our strong overall sales performance for the first three quarters of the year, we now expect system-wide sales to be up in the high-teens in constant currencies for the full year. Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about MCD growth pillars driving our global business.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. Our results are a testament to the focus of our teams on driving growth through our M, C and Ds, and we're confident that momentum will continue. After playing a pivotal role in building out our Fan Truths strategy in U.S., Morgan Stanley is transitioning into the role of Global Chief Marketing Officer. Following the instantly iconic global campaign Morgan developed with BTS, famous orders, again, cross borders with both Russia and Spain launching successful campaigns with local celebrities in the third quarter.  These markets leaned into the idea that truly no matter how big or famous you are or where you are in the world, everyone has their go-to McDonald's order. As Morgan elevates to the global role, we're excited to welcome Tariq Hassan to the Mc family as Chief Marketing and Digital Customer Experience Officer for McDonald's U.S.A. I've known Tariq for many years and I'm confident Tariq will maintain our marketing momentum in the U.S. behind our marketing success as McDonald's craveable core menu.  In the U.S., Crispy Chicken Sandwich sales continue to exceed expectations. This translated into significant growth in QSR chicken market share as we continue to support the Crispy Chicken Sandwich platform with culturally-relevant marketing. In the U.K., we launched our McSpicy Sandwich, which generated the market's best chicken promotional results on record. And in Canada, our spicy McNuggets promotion had a halo effect on McNuggets sales. This quarter we introduced the McPlant sandwich in Austria and the Netherlands as a limited-time offer.  And both the U.K. and Ireland launched the McPlant in a limited number of restaurants, with a goal to roll out nationwide in January. McPlant is available for other market to pull down based on customer demand. As always, we'll do what McDonald's does best: Listen to our customers. When people are ready for the McPlant, we will be ready for them. Being customer driven is about more than just menu items. It's also about delivering feel-good experiences when and where our customers want McDonald's, so we can bring the Golden Arches to as many customers as possible.  That means continue to increase our engagement across drive-thru, digital, and delivery. As we do that, we're seeing an increase in sales mix across these channels. In our top 6 markets, over 20% of sales or about 13 billion year-to-date came through digital channels, whether it was through our app, kiosk in our restaurants, or delivery. Our loyalty program has been an instant fan-favorite and delivers great value to our most loyal customers. It also creates another touch point to increase engagement and take our relationship with customers to more responsive, more personalized places.  We're already seeing increased customer satisfaction and a higher frequency among digital customers compared to non-digital. In September, we launched our loyalty program in Germany, quickly amassing millions of active Rewards customers. And we're on track to bring MyMcDonald's Rewards to Canada by the end of the year, and the U.K. and Australia in the first half of 2022, which means that by mid-2022, loyalty programs will be in our top 6 markets, inclusive of France, which has had a strong loyalty program for many years. Delivery is another bet we made long before COVID, and one that we believe will continue to be a staple for consumers for years to come.  Over the past 5 years, our delivery footprint has grown from just 3,000 of our restaurants to more than 32,000 restaurants across 100 countries. As the needs of our customers have continued to change, delivery has enabled us to increase our reach in gross sales around the world. We're actively engaged in discussions with our largest delivery providers to support the extraordinary growth in our delivery business. We look forward to sharing more information on these global partnership soon. But this is yet another example of where our scale confers upon us competitive advantages.  Lastly, our drive - throughs. With the drive-thru presence that is second to none, our drive-thru sales across our top six markets continue to stay elevated versus pre -pandemic levels, even as dining rooms reopen. We previously shared that we have been testing automated order taking in the drive-thru at several restaurants in the U.S. This was enabled by our acquisition of Apprente, now known as McD Tech Labs in 2019. These tests have shown substantial benefits to customers and the crew experience. To enable development and scale deployment of this program, McDonald's has now entered into a strategic relationship with IBM.  In my mind, IBM is the ideal partner for McDonald's, given their expertise in building AI -powered customer care solutions and voice recognition. IBM will now acquire McD Tech Labs to further accelerate the development of automated order taking. We're in a strong position today, focused on executing our plan, running great restaurants, and taking advantage of our unique size and scale to feed and foster communities. For more on our Q3 financials and our outlook moving forward, I will turn it back over to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. Our strong performance for the quarter resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.76, which excludes the gain as we completed the partial divestiture of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. Our strong sales generated an increase in restaurant margins of about $500 million for the quarter. G&A increased about 20% in constant currencies for the quarter, driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense as a result of Company performance, exceeding our plan this year.  We still expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales for the full year. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was 44.3%, reflecting the improved restaurant margins across all segments and higher other operating income compared to last year. Foreign currency translation benefited Q3 results by $0.04 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to have a minimal impact on Fourth Quarter EPS, with an estimated full-year benefit of 0.21 to $0.23. As usual, this as directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the rest of the year.  And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 7% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5.52 annually. This marked 45 years of increasing our dividend for shareholders, further reinforcing our confidence in accelerating The Arches. We also announced the resumption of our share repurchase program. As a reminder, we had suspended share buybacks at the beginning of the pandemic as we took on additional debt to provide liquidity support to the McDonald's system. Since then, we've been focused on returning to pre-COVID debt ratios that support our strong investment-grade credit rating.  Going forward, we're confident that our operating performance will continue to fuel growth in our already strong free cash flow profile. As a result, we're committed to our historical capital allocation priorities. First, to invest in new restaurants, existing restaurants, and opportunities to grow the business. Then we expect to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time. Now, I'll turn it back to Chris to close.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. We've accomplished so much the past 20 months. And even though the pandemic has greatly altered so much in our business and our world, it hasn't changed the simple fact that we're better together than we are apart. For a long time, we had to bridge physical separation with technology and new ways of working. But as vaccines have reached critical mass of people in the U.S. and some places around the world, we're beginning to see a different future taking shape.  Finally, we're coming together again in our communities, and cities around the world are beginning to open up and get back to a new normal. The same is true for our global McFamily. After being closed for over a year-and-a-half, the McDonald's headquarters reopened on October the 11, and it was inspiring to see teams collaborating again in person. To protect the health and safety of our staff, we required all U.S. - based corporate employees to get vaccinated, and we're continuing to monitor local data and seek guidance from public health officials.  Even though we've only been back for a few short weeks, we have found that working in the office together spurs a level of collaboration, creativity, and connectedness that simply could not be replicated from behind our screens, and we're going to be doing the same thing with our global system soon. Next April, in Orlando, franchisees, suppliers, and employees will convene for our worldwide convention in person for the first time in 4 years. It's already shaping up to be an experience unlike any other.  Together, we'll showcase McDonald's bright future. We'll demonstrate the power of technology for our restaurants, learn how innovation is enhancing the customer experience, and discuss plans in the pipeline to drive our Accelerating the Arches growth plan. As I've said before, it's not only important that we grow, it's equally important that we grow sustainably and in ways that positively impact the communities we serve. Driving climate action has been a centerpiece of our long-term strategy for a while now, and our focus has sharpened.  In fact, in 2014, we established public commitments intended to make our entire system more sustainable by 2020. Among our goals were to sustainably source 100% of key ingredients, including coffee and beef. Looking back, this was just the beginning of what would become a much bolder agenda that we are pursuing with urgency. As the threats to our plan have grown, we are responding with a more ambitious plan for ourselves and for the entire industry.  We achieved many of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule and we build upon that momentum to set new ambitious targets. Just this past September, we announced that we would reduce the use of conventional virgin plastics in Happy Meal toys by 90% by 2025. We recently announced our ambition to achieve net 0 emissions across global operations by 2050, and we joined the UN race to 0. And I look forward to sharing more of our sustainability store with climate delegates at the United Nations Climate Change Conference known as COP26 in Glasgow next week.  We believe we have both a privilege and a responsibility to help lead on issues that matter most in communities, and there is no issue more globally important and locally impactful than protecting our planet for generations to come. This is why I continue to remain optimistic about what lies ahead for McDonald's, accelerating The Arches, fortified by our purpose and guided by our values makes me confident not just in the future successes of our business, but also for the future of the communities that we serve. With that, we'll begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions].  Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles : Thank you. Chris or Kevin, I just wanted to ask about the staffing environment. You touched on a little bit, but if -- to the degree that it was a headwind in 3Q to very strong U.S. same-store sales, I'd be curious. From what we're hearing, it seems to be a bigger issue as the quarter progressed, and you talked about how there's going to be low double digits same-store sales in 4Q, you're seeing that October. Obviously, very strong, but that's just a bit of a deceleration from the very strong sales you saw in the quarter. So curious if you can help with any numbers going to help parse that out a little bit more given it's a challenge for everybody and I would think that McDonald's is better positioned, but not immune. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. I'll start and then let Kevin fill in any other points on this. But certainly, it's a very challenging staffing environment in the U.S., a little bit less so in Europe, but still challenging in Europe. In the U.S. for us, we are seeing, as I've mentioned a few calls ago, that there is wage inflation. Our franchisees are increasing wages, they are over 10% wage inflation year-to-date that we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants. We're up over 15% on wages, and that is having some helpful benefits. Certainly, the higher wages that you pay, it allows you to stay competitive.  But we're also seeing that it's just is very challenging right now in the market to find the level of talent that you need. And so, for us, it is putting some pressure on things like operating hours where we might be dialing back late night, for example, from what we would ordinarily be doing. It's also putting some pressure around speed of service where we are down a little bit on speed of service over the last kind of year-to-date and maybe even in the last quarter. That's also a function of not being able to have the restaurants fully staffed. But I would just \u2013 I would tell you that it's not unsolvable either, and we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants that a really strong focus on the shift manager and providing the training to the shift managers to keep engaged with the crew to keep the crew motivated, that that can make a difference.  But certainly, I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized. And I think it is going to continue to be a difficult environment for the next several quarters. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything you want to add.\nKevin Ozan : Just to touch on your point about Q4 two-year comps for the U.S. And I guess, the fact that they're decelerating a little bit from second and third quarter. A couple of things there, I guess, I'd say. One would be, I think, we're pretty pleased to see two-year comps in low double digits. That's certainly higher than our historical level. And if we're able to sustain that for a long period of time, I think, we'd be pretty happy with that. Certainly, there have been some changes that have gone on related to more of the full service restaurants reopening, stimulus benefits, unemployment benefits, rolling off. And so, we weren't sure how much that would impact our results and are pretty pleased that we're still able to achieve the double-digit comps. And so, I think we feel pretty good about going into fourth quarter right now in the U.S.\nMike Cieplak : Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez : The question is on pricing. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the current level of pricing in the U.S. system and maybe discuss what you think is the appropriate level in the current environment and whether you're seeing any consumer push back.\nKevin Ozan : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Eric. Certainly, pricing and cost pressures are a bigger focus over the last few quarters than they had been previously. Last quarter, I think I talked about how we were seeing roughly a 6% increase year-over-year in the U.S. We are still seeing that and that -- that's pretty much the level we expect for the full year 2021 over 2020 right around that 6%. And that's really to cover both labor cost pressures and commodity cost pressures that we're seeing.  If we step back for a second, obviously, we're all seeing the environment out there on a global basis, which is some pressure on commodities, certainly some pressure on labor availability and cost, supply chain disruptions, et cetera, that are all putting some pressure. We haven't seen, I\u2019ll say, any more resistant to our price increases than we've seen historically. So that the 6% has been pretty well received by customers. We do certainly have a very big focus to make sure that we are balancing cost pressures and being able to cover those with making sure that our value perceptions by customers continue to be favorable. And we are continuing to see those surveys and scores from a value favorability perspective still positive from customers. So, we'll continue to keep an eye on it from a commodity perspective. Commodities were up roughly 2% or so through the first nine months, but we expect for the full year for those to be up roughly 3.5% to 4%, which will put a little bit of additional pressure on the fourth quarter, obviously. And then going into next year from a food and paper cost perspective, we would expect our cost to be up relatively in line with the industry right now. That expectation is roughly mid-single digits.  And so, we will continue to keep an eye both on the cost side and the pricing side. Both we and our franchisees over the last couple of years have been using a third-party for pricing advisory services, if you will, using a pretty deep consumer-based research approach. And so, we have, I think, more science built into our pricing decisions that take into account market conditions, competitive factors, et cetera. So, like I said, we'll keep a close eye on cost and pricing, but right now, so far, it's been received okay by customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to shift the topic a little bit over to the unit growth side of the equation. And if you can give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of unit opens and the availability of both labor and equipment and construction and permitting across both the U.S. and international segments. I think the IOM segment came in a bit light in terms of unit opens this quarter, but you also increased the net unit growth for the year. So just any color on framing out some of the puts and takes, that will be really helpful.\nChris Kempczinski : Yes. Thanks, Jared, for the question. I'll take that. I think it is fair to say, again, just thinking about the global environment, there are certainly supply chain challenges across the world and various things related to kitchen equipment, technology equipment, I'll say, pandemic-related disruptions, slower permitting times, all the things that you mentioned are making it a bigger challenge, I'll say, to get restaurants open than historically. For this year, we still expect roughly in our IOM and U.S. markets. It's down a little bit from where we were previously.  There's be -- there will be a few that will spill over now into 2022. That's more of a timing issue than anything else. And so, because of things taking a little bit longer, some of the openings that we thought we may be able to get done this year will spill into beginning of 2022. Going forward, I think we're still bullish on openings. We still expect our openings to increase both in our wholly-owned markets as well as our development of licensed markets next year.  The increase that you saw right now for 2021 is being primarily driven by China and a few other developmental license markets. So that's why the overall openings are up this year. But I'd say overall it's a bigger challenge than it has been, but our supply chain does a phenomenal job of just managing the whole process, making sure that we've got contingency plans. We're in touch extremely frequently with all of our suppliers, and I feel pretty good about where we are compared to where others may be just because of the strength of our supply chain. But I think it is fair to say that it's a bigger challenge than it's been historically.\nMike Cieplak : Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the IOM markets. Seems like you mentioned the recovery is somewhat staggered. I'm just wondering your bigger picture thoughts in terms of whether you expect the comp recovery in, I believe you said Australia, Germany, and France, whether you think those markets will ultimately accelerate to the U.K. and Canada levels and maybe provide in the next leg of comp growth, or on the flip side maybe there are there reasons why you think those markets will continue to lag whether structural or otherwise. Any thoughts there would be great. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski : Yeah, sure. I'll start off and then, again, Kevin can pick up anything that I miss here. But I think, overall, we remain very optimistic about our international portfolio in the markets where we're seeing restrictions relaxed. Those businesses are bouncing back and bouncing back in a very healthy way. The markets that you mentioned like an Australia, like a France, they have certainly had to navigate a more restrictive COVID environment.  We did get a peak earlier in the year when things appeared to be getting better before the Delta variant that those markets were poised to spring back. So, from our expectation, as soon as the conditions in those markets start to become more favorable in terms of being able to return to normal operating conditions, we expect those markets are going to perform in a very healthy way because that's how they were performing pre -pandemic. So, there's nothing structural that would make us concerned about their ability to bounce back.\nKevin Ozan : The only other thing I'd add is there are a couple of countries, the Spain and a little bit of France also, where they are more reliant on tourism. So as tourism starts getting back and returning a lot, that should help those countries too. But some of the slower countries to come back are some of the more tourist heavy countries, as well as having some of these vaccine passports that just add some logistical challenges with checking customers coming in. But as Chris said, there isn't anything structural that prevent all those countries from coming back strong.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner : Good morning. Thank you. You had a breakout operating margin performance in 3Q in your consolidated EBITDA margins year-to-date are now above 44%. And so, the question is, how do you want us to think about the EBITDA margin opportunity in a post-2021 world? Is there an opportunity to keep expanding from this elevated EBITDA margin level? I know there's more opportunity to leverage G&A and leverage D&A, but there's also a lot of inflation out there, so any color would be helpful.\nKevin Ozan : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brian. Relating to our operating margins, I think in our investor update last year, we talked about for 21 and 22, we thought operating margins would be pretty much in the mid-to-low 40's. I think that's still our thinking right now. There will be some near-term moderation, potentially at restaurant margins as some of the labor costs and commodity costs kick in. But we also expect to get leverage as sales are improving. We're currently in the midst of working through our 2022 plan, so I don't have exactly specifics, but I think generally that mid to low 40s is the way we've been thinking about it, both for this year and for next year.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino : Hi, good morning. I was hoping that you would elaborate a little bit more on the loyalty program and what you're seeing there in the early stages, and just in terms of what it's doing to the business currently. And then, also, if you could give some perspective on how you're collecting data and what you're planning to use or to do with the data that you're collecting as you move into the next few years. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski : Sure. What we're really pleased with how loyalty is starting off in the U.S., we're seeing a similar very nice start to it in Germany and Canada, so the more we learn about loyalty, the more optimistic that we get about loyalty. I think for us in terms of what that means for the business long-term, certainly the benefits you get with a loyalty program is the ability to increase frequency. And in the markets where we operate, roughly 80% of the population visits the McDonald's once a year.  So, it's not that we have a reach opportunity. It's about driving frequency in this business and we've seen in the places that -- where we have deployed loyalty that it absolutely does increase customer frequency. So, for us, that's really encouraging. I think to the broader point of what do you do with the data, we had set out earlier an aspiration where we wanted to have 40% of our customers be known customers. Today, that number is probably only about 5% of the customers where we actually know who is the customer, what did they buy, what did they buy previously.  And then you can imagine all sorts of things that you're able to learn about customers and their preferences when you're able to get more and more of your transactions where you know who the customer is. And loyalty is certainly the way that you get that customer to engage and share information with you. So, for us, I think we're just getting started on it, but very optimistic about what loyalty can do to this business. And by mid-next year, we're going to have a loyalty in our top 6 markets, so I think the ability to give you a better idea of what exactly it's doing for the business, I think once we have that kind of scale and rollout, we'll be able to talk with even more specificity about it.\nOperator: Next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger : Thank you. Chris, just wondering if you could speak a bit more to the strong momentum that you've got in the U.S. and roughly how you maintain that momentum and the market share gains going forward? I know you've been asked this question coming into the year and throughout the year. And I think you've consistently suggested the momentum would continue despite having the lapse some of the strong results that you've gone up against. And you folks have done just that. So just curious if you have any additional thoughts from here about how to think about that U.S. momentum going into 22, just perhaps you're framing up some of the key existing initiatives that maybe you've already touched on. And at a high level, any kind of upcoming things that'll help support that momentum as you go into next year. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski : Sure. Well, I think, shout out to the U.S. team and our own operators for doing a great job of sustaining that momentum as you mentioned, through what continues to be a challenging environment for all the reasons that have come up on this call; labor challenges, commodity inflation, et cetera. I think the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S. business is not something that just came about in the last couple of years.  This was something that started several years ago with the foundation that we put in place in the U.S. and the foundation was around modernizing our state, improving the food, making investments in digital and delivery. And I think the fact that we were able to get all of those things sort of embedded in the business back-end, call it 2017, 2018, set us up really well for what none of us could have predicted, which is what we've now experienced through, through COVID. So, I think for us, what I feel good about with the U.S. is we've got the foundational elements in place for this business to outperform or perform quite well for extended period of time.  As to how you do that, it's going to be back to the strategy that we have with accelerating the urges. It's a focus on great marketing, driving core menu and outperforming on the 3Ds delivery drive-thru and digital. And so, for us, a message that I'm talking about to the teams internally is we have the right strategy. It's all about execution, and we've got to execute at a really high level. If we do that on those three dimensions, then I'm confident. But we also can't get complacent, and I think there's a good healthy level of dialogue going on in the U.S. right now about just keeping that hunger, keeping that momentum going. And once you've got it, you don't want to give it up and that's the mindset right now.\nOperator: Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass : Thanks very much. First, on delivery, can you just update? I know you gave the total digital mix. What delivery makes up of that and maybe a quick -- since post - COVID, there's been acceleration in that -- where it stands now versus prior. You also -- Chris talked about maybe being more strategic in your partner -- picking your partners in delivery. I just wondered if you could expand on that. And just probably just want to make sure I understand, if you're selling that Tech Labs or transferring it to [Indiscernible], is there anything material we should know about, either G&A or anything that would impact the financials due to that transaction?\nKevin Ozan : We're trying to get all the parts of that.\nChris Kempczinski : I'll do the delivery question, while Kevin is going through his notes, the other parts of this. But so, we don't share a specific breakout on delivery, but suffice to say, delivery for us continues to be a really important driver for us. The business has grown by billions and billions, I think it's fair to share, over the last several years and we're continuing to see even as markets reopen and things start to get back to normal in places where they're able to get the dining room, etc., back open. Delivery remains elevated.  And so, for us, I think what has become apparent is delivery was meeting a customer need that I don't think any of us fully appreciated, even maybe a few years ago. So, it's here to stay. What we're trying to do with our partners, the way that we had approached some of our delivery conversations previously with our 3PO partners, in many cases those were discussions that were happening at the market levels. And when you are a Company the size and scale of McDonald's, we believe a great proposition for 3PO partners on a global basis.  And so, what we're trying to do through these conversations is leverage the fact that we are the largest restaurant Company in the world that we have an ability to drive traffic onto 3PO apps that we think is second to none, and that that should be reflected in the rates that we're paying with our 3PO partners. So those conversations are proceeding, but I'd say there is a good recognition on both sides that we need each other. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to get to a good resolution on that in the next couple of months.  And then just to follow up on your question related to our transaction with IBM and the potential impact of that. There shouldn't be much of a financial statement impact of that. We had generally, I forget maybe about less than a 100 people I think that were associated with that business. And so those folks will now go work with IBM. Really the reason we're doing this with IBM is to be able to have someone that can take how far we've gotten right now with the solution and be able to finish the development and then help us deploy this at scale. And so, we're going to use their expertise certainly in AI and everything that they've learned from Watson, etc. But it is indeed a big financial statement impact. Plus, or minus, I\u2019ll say going forward from that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Carroll with RBC.\nChris Carroll : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just following up on the U.S. business, you noted the benefit to average track from larger order sizes and menu pricing which you gave us some detail on a little while ago. Can you comment on your view of the sustainability of recent average check drivers? It seems like some of the recent guest behaviors are remaining consistent around group ordering, maybe perhaps longer than expected. So, curious as to your thoughts around your ability or focus on maintaining check growth, and perhaps how digital helps drive this going forward?\nKevin Ozan : I'll try and I'll let Chris add on to this one. It's a good question because you're right. I think early on in the pandemic, I think we believed that the average check would decline quicker than it certainly has. And I think the reason right now, at least is because the channels that much of our sales are going through which continue to be things like drive-thru delivery, digital as you mentioned, people are still going through and ordering for several people.  If you're getting delivery, you're getting it for your family or for at least a couple of people, if -- a lot of the folks going through drive-thru are getting orders for several people, And so we are seeing those larger order sizes continue. And I think at least some of that will be stickier than we originally may have thought. So, we don't anticipate certainly in the near-term average check returning back to the level it was at pre -pandemic. I think -- I lost my train of thought, but I do think we will continue to see the check continue to grow as those channels continue to grow. And like I said, we're not seeing any degradation of that check at this point.\nChris Kempczinski : Maybe just to fill in here a few things and I'll go back and quote my CFO from something that he said several quarters ago, which is we are still selling more stuff. We're still selling more sandwiches; we're selling more fries. And so, from a unit standpoint, while we certainly are looking at traffic, the absolute volume of what we're selling is continuing to grow. And for me, that's a really good barometer about the health of this business.  I think as to whether that sustained whether these larger order sizes sustained, we're going to follow the customer to whichever way they want to go. If the customers start to come back and split the ticket and we have smaller check, I think so long as we continue to focus on the execution, we'll be just fine on that. But certainly, I think what you're seeing right now and what we're expecting is that some of the benefits that we're seeing around larger check and the mix -- the channel mix that goes with that, we're expecting that to continue.\nOperator: Next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the McPlant test in the U.S. Can you talk about what you've heard from consumers with respect to demand for a plant-based option. And then, from a franchisee perspective, what's the demand to offer plant-based option on the menu or deliveries given the current operating backdrop? And it looks like the test is being conducted in diverse cities. So, anything you can share on differences in demand across the markets from the perspective of both consumers and franchisees?\nChris Kempczinski : Yeah. I think in the U.S. it's really early to be making any kind of readout on what we're learning. I would point out it's in less than 10 restaurants in the U.S. It's largely an operations test right now. Now, there are other markets that are further along. The U.K. is in 250 restaurants and they're going to be planning on doing a full national rollout in the U.K. in Q1. In that situation, I think we have more evidence that it is filling an unmet need that certainly existed in the U.K. on their menu. So early results in the U.K. are very encouraging.  A couple other markets as well in the -- in Europe have seen success with McPlant in the roll out on that. So, I think this is one where we've said all along, we're going to let them markets decide when is the best time to pull it down based on what the customer acceptance are interested in this concept. I think certainly I can say at this point there are definitely a couple of European markets where there is customer acceptance for it. Whether that is a broad-based acceptance in the U.S., I think we'll learn that over the next several quarters.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Milan with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Milan : Just follow-up on the unit growth topics specific to the IOM segment. You're putting aside transitory related and timing-related issues. Do you see any opportunity to go faster on development there over the next few years versus what you might have previously been planning for prior to the pandemic? And if you do see increase opportunity, is there -- is there any kind of upper limit in terms of the number of gross openings that makes sense for that business. Is it just a function of managing the level of CapEx spend you're comfortable with or there are actual operational constraints to think about too?\nChris Kempczinski : Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. I think to be fair; we had started thinking about accelerating some of the openings internationally, even pre -pandemic. Certainly, nothing that's happened in the pandemic has changed our thinking at all related to that. And if anything, I think just reinforces that our opportunity to continue growing in many of those international operated markets. As far as any constraints, I think the constraints really are from a market perspective, there is a sweet spot of what they can open in terms of building a pipeline, having the right real estate representatives, opening in a way that it isn't disruptive to the rest of the market. So, we do have a lot of tools that we use to determine what the appropriate opening level is for the markets.  I think we do have opportunity to open quicker in many of those markets than we have been, and I think our expectation is that we will continue to grow in many of those international operative markets where we still believe there's a lot of opportunity. We're just in the midst of going through our plans right now for 2022, So I don't have specifics yet for 2022, but I think it is fair to say that we would expect our openings next year to be higher than they are in 2021 and continue to kind of increase that level for a little while where we will -- we've talked about unit growth being about 1.5% to 2% contribution to sales growth. Right now, we're at the lower end of that, more than 1.5% and likely not a lot above that for '22 because it really relates to \"21 openings. But as we go on, I would expect that to get closer to that 2% contribution.\nOperator: The next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe : A lot about drive-thru, digital and delivery. The question really is on dine-in, and as you've seen, various consumers in various markets respond in a post COVID environment in terms of their behavior. What are you thinking about using dine-in longer-term and do you have an opportunity to pivot that asset even further to focus more on the off-premise up, off-premise consumer as we think about leveraging all of the asset, not just part of it.\nChris Kempczinski : That's a great question, and it is one that we're thinking about. It's something that is now on the plate for Manu Steijaert. Manu is, as we announced, I think last quarter, it was -- that he's the Chief Customer Officer. And one of the things that fits in Manu's portfolio, is he has both restaurant design operations, as well as the customer experience. And so, thinking about what is going to be the consumer acceptance on a sustaining basis for dine-in coming out of this and then what are the implications of that. I would add we have a lot of play places in our restaurants. What is the implication for the plate place space? So, we are just now starting to think about that and think about potential scenarios for how you might reuse the space if dine-in doesn't come back to the level that it was pre -pandemic. But I think right now it's still a little bit preliminary just because there's still noise in the dine-in numbers that I don't want to do anything hasty here until we just get a better bead on what does dine-in sustain up, but it's certainly something for us to be thinking about.\nKevin Ozan : The only other thing I'd add is on the international side, certainly in Europe, dine-in is a bigger percentage of our sales and it is an important part of that business, and we have seen dine-in return. I mean, kiosk usage is getting back to almost where it was pre -pandemic, and so the family business is very important in Europe, and so to Chris ' point, we got to be careful about what we do because it isn't the same around the world as far as dine-in business, and how customers view that side of the business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.\nSara Senatore : Thank you. I wanted to go back to the technology piece. In particular on whereas characters as big data. I know you're partnering with IBM because of -- they have expertise. But as I think about loyalty, one of the things that I think that's really about, it's not just the data, it's what you do with it. Are there opportunities to partner, whether it's IBM or other tech companies within loyalty, or maybe more broadly that you see where outside expertise would be useful?  And maybe more specifically, is this a signal as to how you're thinking about technology in-sourcing versus outsourcing? So, where McDonald's should own the technology or really has specific expertise in maybe customer-facing UI versus some of the behind-the-scenes capabilities. So just anything you can signal about that and longer-term as we think about your technology budget. Does this change over time, not just with the front day, but more broadly? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski : Yeah, thanks, Sara. And I think this is one where I'd go back to the conversation you and I had, I don't know, it was probably several quarters ago now, on this topic of how do we think about technology, what's insource, what's outsource. My thinking then is the same as my thinking now, which is there are certain times where it may make sense for us to go acquire a technology so that we can accelerate the development of that, make sure that it is bespoke to McDonald's needs.  But at some point, that technology reaches a level of development, where I think getting it to a partner who can then blow it out and scale it globally makes more sense. And so, I think, what we did with the print day is very much consistent with that philosophy, which is we've had it for a couple of year. I've been really pleased with how the team has progressed the development of that. We're seeing some very encouraging results in the restaurants that we have it. But there's still a lot of work that needs to go into introducing other languages, being able to do it across 14,000 restaurants with all the various menu permutations, etc. And that work is beyond the scale of our core competencies, if you will.  And so, I think in this case, IBM is a natural partner for us. I think going forward, it's going to be very much on a case-by-case basis as to when we just -- we go from day 1 with the partner versus where we might bring something in-house for a period of time. But the nice thing about being McDonald's is we're everybody's first call when it comes to a partner in the restaurant industry. And so, we have a really good visibility to the various partners out there, and certainly, I think, our overall view is we are best on a long-term sustaining basis to use others externally partnering. But again, there may be time-to-time where there's benefit for us from being able to accelerate and learn to have it in for a period of time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping to tie it into some earlier questions. I was wondering if you could get into how your customer demographics may be shifting in the U.S. And specifically, it seems like either through product innovation, obviously new mediums in terms of ordering or even in marketing, you're talking to a younger customer than you've been talking to for years. So, I'm wondering if that's actually showing up in the data and if frequencies changing amongst that group which is obviously a good lead indicator for longer term demand for the business. But if you wouldn't mind expanding, that'd be great.\nChris Kempczinski : Sure. Well, I think not just in our industry but across, I'd say most consumer industries. The youth and the preferences and desires of the youth drive consumer demand, whether it's in apparel, beverages, restaurant, etc. And so, it becomes a very natural demographic to target. That 18 to 35 target is from a media standpoint, probably the most coveted, the most expensive demographic to reach because of the brand preferences that get formed at an early age and that's sustained over the lifetime value of that customer.  So, I think you're absolutely spot on and observing that we have made a more demonstrable push against that demographic. And I expect that that's going to continue. And it's one that -- we believe that McDonald's that we have a brand that could be part of culture. And we probably have, not in my view, we haven't done enough to lean into the stature of our brand and culture, and how we can connect to that. I think finding properties, finding a message that resonate with youth, but also resonate more broadly in culture, for us is a big upside opportunity. And we're seeing other markets.  The U.S. started some of this, but we're seeing other markets like Russia, like Spain pick up on the famous orders concept and getting very similar results on that. Just to me, it speaks to the ability of this brand and what we can do with it. I think in terms of how is that changing the mix? It's still early days on this, so I think we are seeing certainly the brand sentiment improving, but we're also having to move a pretty big boat here, and so we're not yet seeing it show up in terms of a big demographic shift within the business, but frankly, nor did we. This is something that I think for us is going to sustain over several years and it's -- again it's about making sure that our brand is one that is as powerful in the future as it has been in the past.\nKevin Ozan : We have time for one last question from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer : Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick technical question. Was there a gap between the Company and franchise same-store sales growth, particularly in the IOM and especially on two-year? I asked that because I remember you used to have a lot of Company stores in urban centers, which I would imagine would be slower to recover. But my bigger picture question was on free cash flow.  Do you anticipate the free cash flow yield moving up over time? I would imagine at over 100% would be achievable given the gap between depreciation and maintenance CapEx on the owned real estate franchise restaurants. And if you agree, when do you think you could get there? And perhaps you can give us a window into how you're thinking about growth CapEx, of course, which would be in that answer. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski : Yeah, let me start with your comp question, I guess. For the third quarter, at least both the U.S. and IOM comps were a little bit higher in with franchisees than they were with Company operated. That's not dramatically different than [Indiscernible] so for a while that's generally been the trend. Some of that is driven certainly in the U.S. depending on what the location of where our Company-operated stores are versus others.  But in general, franchisees are running a little bit ahead of Company operated on a comp basis, and that is what we saw both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I'll say this year. Related to free cash flow, we've said we expect our free cash flow coverage to -- conversion to be greater than 90%, both for this year and going forward. I don't want to surmise of when or if it could get to over 100%; for now, we're going to stay with that over 90%. I think we are seeing that we have a pretty healthy flow through in our P&L that converts to free cash flow.  The big question right now, and again as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still in our planning phase to look at capital requirements and what that means related to some of the opening opportunities that I mentioned earlier, etc. So, we've got to take all those pieces into account to figure out what the free cash flow profile looks for several years. We do expect free cash flow dollars to continue to grow. And I would expect that free cash flow conversion certainly to stay at high levels.\nMike Cieplak : Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Kevin. Thanks everyone for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude McDonald's Corporation investor conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-28 14:03:08", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Second Quarter 2021 Investor Conference Call.

At the heart of McDonald's is the experience we offer. And for 65-years, we've created iconic experiences for billions of people around the world. Along the way, we've always focused on following our customers\u2019 needs, finding those convenient and engaging ways for them to enjoy McDonald's. At our founding, the restaurant experience was relatively simple. Customers would walk up to the front counter, place their orders and get hot, delicious, fresh food served to them quickly. In the early 1970s, McDonald's pioneered the drive-through as a new service channel for customers. And in the last few years, we've added even more service channels with delivery, curbside pickup kiosks, and table service. At the heart of each of these innovations was our global mobile app, which has evolved our customer experience from the physical world to the digital world. As this evolution continues, our digital offerings will become even more important to serving, interacting with and delighting our customers around the world, and the insights generated from these platforms will help us further improve their experience. Our marketing power and scale will continue to be critical throughout this journey, turning the various customer touchpoints into a holistic and compelling brand experience. But our aspirations are even higher. And to reach these goals, we need to create a more frictionless customer experience across all our service channels. Our customers should be able to move seamlessly between the in-store, takeaway and delivery service channels so that we offer even more convenience and better personalization. That's why we were excited to announce earlier this week, the creation of a team that has oversight for the end-to-end customer experience, under the leadership of our first Chief Customer Officer in McDonald's history, Manu Steijaert, Manu will oversee everything from the physical restaurants that we design and build, to the digital experiences that we embed along each step of the customer journey. As we finished the global rollout of EOTF, Manu and his team will now be focused on what's next to drive a new layer of sustained growth for our system that leverages the foundations that we've built. For the past 18-months, our digital customer engagement, global marketing, data analytics, and restaurant solutions teams have worked to standardize our infrastructure, and align the system against some common frameworks. These efforts ultimately pave the way for My McDonald's rewards, our first global digital offering that we are now deploying across our largest markets. My McDonald's rewards are just the first example of how we will lead as a digital innovator, by leveraging our scale and engaging with our customers in a truly integrated way. Manu is the ideal choice to integrate these teams and take their work to the next level, with an intense focus on driving incomparable customer-centric innovation. He has been an important part of the McDonald's system for more than 20-years at every level. Manu knows these teams well and has an incredibly deep understanding of the needs of our customers. One route in his early experience as a crew member in his parents McDonald's franchise, in his native Belgium. We believe that connecting these teams will enable us to deliver the seamless omni channel experience that our customers want, and only McDonald's can provide. Transforming the way customers connect with, interact with and experience our brand. Further strengthening our ways of working to better serve our customers is one of many ways we're working to accelerate the arches today. This complements the work underway to accelerate the arches with investments in customer-centric creative marketing that only McDonald's can offer so fully. That marketing made a measurable impact in the second quarter with the global debut of our incredibly successful famous orders marketing platform. I'll have more to say about that a bit later. We're accelerating the arches by committing to our core menu. We're tapping into customer demand for the familiar and making the chicken, burgers and coffee our customers love even more delicious. We're borrowing from what has worked well in other markets, like the growing success of the McSpicy chicken sandwich. McSpicy launched in China over 20-years ago, and customers can now enjoy this great tasting sandwich in multiple markets around the world. Late last year, we launched McSpicy in Australia as part of their new chicken sandwich lineup. And earlier this month, it debuted in the UK to great fanfare. We also continue to leverage our familiar favorites and create new ones to make our menu even more craveable. In the U.S., the momentum from the successful launch of our crispy chicken sandwich continued into the second quarter, as we supported the platform with culturally relevant advertising. Just one more way that our beloved core menu continues to drive growth, while anchoring a customer experience that is second to none. We also know that the customer experience today reaches beyond the physical walls of our restaurants. That's why we're accelerating the arches to better serve our digitally connected customers. To give you a sense of the growing digital connection we have to our customers, we have the most downloaded QSR app in the United States. And earlier this month, we were proud to launch our new loyalty program, My McDonald's rewards in the U.S. The loyalty of every McDonald's fans has been unmatched for 65-years. And with these new digital connections, we're able to do an even better job of rewarding them for it. We already have over 22 million active My McDonald's users in the U.S., with over 12 million enrolled in our new loyalty program, My McDonald's rewards. And that's before national advertising for loyalty which began earlier this week. Well that's a good example of how our core menu and personalized marketing come together through digital channels to build a stronger relationship with our customers. Our digital system-wide sales across our top six markets were nearly $8 billion in the first-half of 2021, a 70% increase versus last year. And that's why we're moving aggressively to bring My McDonald's rewards to our top six markets. We currently have loyalty programs in place in France and the U.S., Germany and Canada plan to launch My McDonald's rewards before the end of this year, followed by the UK and Australia in 2022. We're just as excited about our drive-throughs, through which much of our business has come from this year and about delivery. Over 80% of our restaurants across 100 markets globally now offer delivery. We're excited about our success with multiple 3PO partners. And as I said last quarter, we continue to innovate. Overall, our recent successes show that our M, C and D growth pillars working in concert can deliver unmatchable experiences for our customers, and drive growth unlike anything else in customer retail. Of course, our work to accelerate the arches is built on the foundation of the very core of McDonald's success, running great restaurants. As we open our dining rooms, return to regular hours and get back to full staffing, we know that world-class execution will be more important than ever. While the Delta variant has brought more stops and starts to the COVID story around the world, people are venturing out and establishing new routines. That includes a return to in-person dining. Today, about 70% of our dining rooms in the U.S. are open. By Labor Day, barring resurgences it will be nearly 100%. Internationally, the majority of our restaurants are now operating all channels including dine-in, but many continue to operate with limited hours or restricted capacity. We're working hard to get back to normal. When our customers are ready to come back to dining in our restaurants, we will be more than ready and eager to welcome them. Not only are we more resilient today than we were heading into the pandemic, as Kevin will tell you we are building from a position of strength. Kevin?\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. I'm pleased to share that global comp sales were up 40% in the second quarter, or 7% on a two year basis. Our performance has continued demonstration of the broad base strength and resiliency of our business. We've surpassed 2019 sales levels for the second consecutive quarter, and now at an accelerated rate. Turning to the segment performance for the quarter, we grew comp sales across all segments versus 2019 levels, as business recovery progresses at varying degrees around the world. In the U.S., our momentum continued with Q2 comp sales up 26% or 15% on a two year basis, our strongest quarterly two year growth in over 15-years. And we saw double digit positive comps across all day parts on a two year basis. While at the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record high operating cash flow. Our performance in the U.S. is the result of an accumulation of decisions that we've made over the last 18-months. This includes bold marketing initiatives, investing in the core menu and strengthening our digital offerings, with an underlying focus on running great restaurants. As customers in the U.S. began to venture out more during the second quarter, we continued to see strong average check growth, driven by larger order sizes, and menu price increases. That's been bolstered by growth in delivery and digital platforms, as well as robust menu and marketing programs. This includes an advertising rehit of our crispy chicken sandwich, which continues to perform at an elevated level, and the success of our BTS meal. Both initiatives attracted customers and drove incremental sales in the quarter. In our international operated market segment, which has been historically strong, recovery is taking hold. Comp sales were up 75% in the quarter, or nearly 3% on a two year basis, as we left the peak in 2020 restaurant closures. Remember, in some cases full country operations were shut down in Q2 last year due to the pandemic. Although, we're continuing to monitor recent resurgences of COVID in countries around the world, Western Europe began to reopen during the quarter, allowing us to bring back indoor dining, still with some restrictions in place. IOM segment comp sales began exceeding 2019 levels in May. Strong performance continued in Australia. The market benefited from continued growth in delivery and successful marketing in core menu news, including the BTS famous orders and 50th birthday Big Mac promotion. While, Australia produced strong results for the quarter. Outbreaks of the COVID-19 Delta variant throughout the country have led to recent lockdowns and reduced customer mobility. Momentum accelerated in both the UK and Canada in Q2. In the UK, the National lockdown ended and the market reopened dining rooms in mid-May. The market saw record digital engagement with a significant portion of sales coming through digital channels, where customers place delivery orders and use self-order kiosks as dining rooms reopened. Canada benefited from strong marketing activity featuring our core menu, including the BTS famous orders meal. In France and Germany, comp sales were still below 2019 levels for the quarter. While some restrictions are still in place, indoor dining reopened for both markets in June. And we've seen steady improvements since then. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect comps to surpass pre-pandemic levels across all of our big five international markets. The past year has shown us that when markets reopen customer demand for McDonald's returns quickly. Comp sales in the international development license segment were up 32% for the quarter, are relatively flat on a two year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Brazil, Japan and China. Japan maintained momentum in Q2 with comps up nearly 10%, achieving an impressive 23 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth. The markets performance was driven by strong menu and marketing promotions, delivery growth, and our ability to continue serving customers their favorites, safely and conveniently throughout state of emergency waves across the country. In China, comps were strong for the quarter, but have yet to return to 2019 levels due to COVID resurgences in Southern China, resulting in operating restrictions. The market continues to build its digital member base with a successful My McDonald's app launch and focused delivery expansion in the breakfast and evening day parts. In addition, China surpassed the 4,000 restaurant mark in June, and is now on pace to open over 500 new restaurants this year. Given our slightly quicker recovery and continued momentum around the world, we now expect full year system-wide sales growth in the mid to high teens in constant currencies. However, there's still some uncertainty as we continue to see pandemic-related stops and starts in markets around the world, especially now with the Delta variant. Now I'll turn it back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, we're finding ways to capitalize on our strengths. As we've seen the growth pillars of accelerating the arches are deeply interconnected, reinforcing and bolstering one another. It is at the intersection of our MCD that we continue to deepen our connection with customers, and create a consistent and enjoyable experience, proving that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Which brings us back to our famous orders platform, when it launched in the U.S. last year, our goal was to create an ambitious marketing campaign, one that would leverage our customers favorite core menu items, speak to a new generation in authentic ways, and increase digital engagement without adding any restaurant complexity, all while positioning us for the longer-term. The famous orders platform was based on a simple idea, but unites all our customers including famous celebrities is everyone has their go to McDonald's order. To Travis Scott, then J Balvin famous orders broke records in the U.S. This quarter, the BTS famous order took that ambition global, connecting our marketing, core menu and digital strategies in 50 markets. And it was our first famous order with custom packaging and app exclusive content. It has been to borrow a BTS lyric dynamite. We saw significant lifts in McNuggets sales and record breaking levels of social engagement. McDonald's customers and BTS fans all over the globe downloaded our app, ordered chicken McNuggets with delicious sweet chili and cajun dipping sauces, and posted about it on social media, leading McDonald's to trend number two on Twitter globally, and number one in the U.S. And then the BTS army took it a step further and memorialized the partnership, creating shoes, accessories and frame memorabilia from our packaging. They were so appreciative of the meal that the BTS army went out of their way to prepare snacks for our crew and managers in Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam to support them on launch day. The famous order platform is the M, C and D in action. Both famous orders and My McDonald's rewards are also reminders of the unrivaled convening power of McDonald's. And this is just the beginning of the digital customer journey at McDonald's. As we create more personal and seamless McDonald's experiences and make it easier for our crew to connect with our customers, we're giving customers multiple reasons to continue to come back to McDonald's. By using digital, we will also leverage our advantages in value and convenience, day part and menu breath and our biggest advantage our size and scale. Now, for more on the financial performance in Q2, I'll pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. Adjusted earnings per share in Q2 was $2.37, which excludes a gain on the further sale of some of our ownership in McDonald's Japan, and a one-time income tax benefit in the UK. In year-to-date adjusted operating margin was 43%, reflecting improved sales performance across all segments, and higher other operating income compared to last year. Total restaurant margin dollars grew $1.3 billion in constant currencies, with improvement in both franchised and company operated restaurant margins, mostly driven by higher comp sales as a result of COVID-19 impact last year. Company operated margins in the U.S. were strong, as we continue to see top-line growth driven by higher average check. In the IOM segment, company operating margins improved significantly in Q2, as sales have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. G&A decreased 1% in constant currencies for the quarter, primarily due to lapping our $160 million incremental marketing investment last year, offset by higher incentive-based compensation, and increased spend in restaurant technology. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7% for the quarter, and we're projecting the tax rate for the back-half of 2021 in the range of 21% to 23%. And finally, foreign currency translation benefited Q2 results by $0.13 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to benefit EPS by about $0.03 to $0.05 for Q3, with an estimated full year tailwind of $0.20 to $0.22. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year. Now, I'll turn it back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished during the past 18-months. It's a remarkable testament to the resiliency of the McDonald's system. But as we turn our focus to the incredible opportunities that lie ahead of us, it's also reminded us of where we must go. For 65-years, the one unassailable truth about McDonald's is that we get better together. There's a reason why it's one of our core values, continually finding ways to better ourselves, and our system is how we keep our business relevant, not just for this generation, but the next. How do we get better together today? We get better together by focusing on our people. In this highly competitive market for talent, successful employee recruitment and retention is fundamental to drive growth. That's why in May, we announced a 10% increase in the average hourly wage at our company-owned restaurants in the U.S., with the goal to get to a $15 an hour wage by 2024. We get better together through diversity, equity and inclusion. Today, 23% of our U.S.-based suppliers come from diverse backgrounds, more than double the industry average. We have set a goal to increase purchases of goods and services from diverse owned suppliers by 10% over the next four years. That will put us in a position where a quarter of our U.S. spend is with diverse own suppliers by 2025. And we've committed to doubling our national advertising spend with diverse owned media here in the United States, between 2021 and 2024. We get better together by serving our customers, but also serving a larger purpose in communities across the world. As part of our ongoing efforts to support communities through the pandemic, we recently partnered with the Biden Administration to make access to information on vaccines easier for the millions of customers who enjoy McDonald's in the U.S. Our part in the national We Can Do This campaign continues this month with McDonald's hot McCaf\u00e9 cups, McDelivery seal stickers, both of which lead customers to vaccines.gov. In Canada, we're doing something similar around This Is Our Shot, the national campaign through which McDonald's will supply information in restaurant and drive-through orders, while supporting a digital campaign to replace vaccine hesitancy with confidence. Finally, we get better together through our commitment to our planet. In May of 2014, we were one of the first major corporations of our size to publicly commit to a sustainability framework. We promised that we would report on our progress against our 2020 sustainability goals by the fall of this year. As we prepare to release our impact report, I've never been prouder of the difference we're making in the world. We're working closely with partners across the globe today to source food locally and responsibly, to expand our use of sustainable packaging, and to power our restaurants with renewable energy sources. It's the ultimate example of our three legged stool in action, where owner operators, suppliers and employees each play a critical role in our efforts to protect the planet. We're working every day to set ambitious goals and to hold ourselves accountable, to be known not just for what we do as a company, but how we do it. It's part of our broader commitment to transparency and to following clear science-based guidelines from the experts. We know we still have much work to do. But our internal strategy and the external landscape are converging to create a moment unlike any other. We are aware of our unique role in the world. We are inspired by all the opportunities that lie ahead. Over the back-half of this year, I'm looking forward to getting back into the restaurants around the world and spending more face time with our people. I'm amazed with everything that our system has accomplished over the past 18-months, and we can't wait to write the next great chapter of the McDonald's story together. With that, we will begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you. Chris, you talked about delivering a more frictionless experience and just given the pledge to engage guests in new ways and in the backdrop of the challenging industry staffing situation in U.S., is this prompting you to accelerate implementation of Apprente AI voice ordering at the drive-through? I was hoping you can provide an update on your ambitions for a lot of the drive-through technology over both the near and medium-term. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Andrew. When we announced earlier this week, the creation of the Chief Customer Officer job it was with the idea that as we are introducing more service channels, we have an opportunity to design it in such a way that it feels like these things all happen at the same time, as opposed to in reality how they happened, which was kind of one came after the other. So Manu\u2019s chatter is about making this so that the customer feels that this is a completely seamless experience in the restaurant. I think as the point that you're raising about Apprente is related to it, but it's not central to it. I think we announced maybe it was about a month or two ago that we were seeing good progress with Apprente. It's in 10 restaurants. But that is going to be a significant effort that takes us a number of years before we're able to deploy that in the U.S. So I wouldn't read or interpret anything around Manu\u2019s announcement as related to accelerating Apprente, there's still a lot of heavy lifting, associated with getting Apprente ready for deployment across the U.S. and eventually the globe.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks, and good morning. I have questions on labor, I was just wondering if you can comment on staffing levels now versus maybe earlier in the quarter, whether you've seen a material improvement across the system, particularly in some of those states that have ended the government benefits early? And then maybe if you can comment some of the strategies the franchisees have used to successfully attract talent? And how the recent labor shortage might have impacted drive-through speed and whether that's become a drag on sales? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Eric. It's certainly still a challenging staffing environment, not just in the U.S., we're also seeing in Europe, where staffing is challenging in part because of some of the limitations of movement of people across borders. But if you focus on the U.S., while it is a challenge, it's getting better. I don't want to declare by any means that it's easy, but we're certainly seeing some improvement. We're seeing applications have increased pretty significantly, applications in states that have ended early the Federal stimulus, those have tended to do even better. So I do think that there's evidence that as the Federal stimulus rolls off, that you'll see an improvement in the application rate. And I think you're seeing wages go up as well. I mean, we made our announcement. I think broadly, we're seeing wages going up about 5% or so in our U.S. restaurants. And that is also helping improve the situation. I would just point out for us, in our McOpCo restaurants after we made our announcement back in April, we're getting close to full staffing levels or what we would deem to be kind of our full staffing levels in our McOpCo restaurant. So it is possible, the situation is improving. I think the tools and some of the ideas that you're seeing our franchisees out there deploying, whether its things like free childcare, sign on bonuses, et cetera that's the power of the McDonald's system at work and the power of our sort of local franchisees, innovating and coming up with ways to ensure that they can staff the restaurants. In the short-term right now, there has been a negative impact on staffing and service times. As you may remember, we've improved service times over the last few years by about 30 seconds. More recently, we've seen service times decrease about three seconds, so we don't love that. But a big part of it is certainly associated with the staffing challenges in the restaurant, but also the demand that we're seeing in the restaurant. So, I'm constructive and positive on the staffing outlook. In the back-half, I think we're going to continue to make progress, but it certainly is a challenge.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Chris, you've got strong momentum in the U.S. and what sounds like a solid strategy and plan to enable continued growth over both the near and the longer-term. But it's more difficult comparison approach, how are you thinking about maintaining that underlying momentum going forward? And maybe if you could kind of help us frame up sort of existing and perhaps emerging drivers that help you to support further gains over the coming quarters in the U.S.? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. So I think the strategy that we've laid out accelerating the arches strategy had three growth pillars that for us, we're going to be multi-year drivers of this. It was going to be the M, which was marketing, the C, which was core menu, and the three Ds of digital delivery and drive-through. So I don't think you're going to see a deviation from those three pillars as being what drives sort of the next layers of growth. I do expect, what you will see is that we will see us continuing to find ways within those to move the business forward. So starting with the M, famous orders has been a nice idea for us. My challenge to our marketing team here at McDonald's is what's the next great idea. And we think there's certainly more we can do with famous orders. But we've got to keep coming up with new ideas from a marketing standpoint. So I think that's got to be something that's on us to deliver. With core menu, we are rolling out in a number of markets, we've been rolling out a new way to cook are 10 to one patties, that is delivering hotter and fresher burgers. We're seeing nice lifts in Canada and Australia, when we've done that. We call it rapid turnover. We're going to deploy that to the rest of the market as well. I think that's another thing for us. And we're seeing in chicken, certainly we've had a lot of success with the chicken sandwich in the U.S. so far. McSpicy, as I referenced in my opening remarks, that's something that we're taking out, so moving there. And then lastly, we're in the early, early stages on digital. And I'm incredibly encouraged by what I'm seeing so far with the loyalty rollout. We're seeing very good customer adoption for us to be at 12 million loyalty users, before we've even turned on the advertising is I think, a great start there and just a testament to customers sort of pent-up demand for this type of offering for us. So, there's not any one thing that I would point to. The strategy is still very much intact, and we're going to execute, and you're just going to see us continue to come out with ideas within that that are going to continue the momentum. Kevin, I don't know if you want to give any kind of outlook about sort of how we think about Q3 and beyond.\nKevin Ozan: Well, just as we think about Q3, I guess both for U.S. and IOM, U.S. as we've talked about, obviously, we had a great two year trend in the second quarter. As we look a little bit ahead to the third quarter, I think we would see it moderating a little bit in the U.S. on a two year basis, but still being double digit and certainly very strong. The IOM segment on the other hand will continue accelerating its momentum. Several of the markets, as we mentioned, just opened and reopened in May and June. And so we anticipate strong momentum continuing in the IOM for the rest of the year.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up to that last comment about IOM. I guess, on the last call you had expected IOM to your comps to stay negative in the second quarter. And obviously, you did much better than that. So, I wanted to ask kind of what surprised you to the upside? And then secondarily, do you think as these markets reopen, that you're picking up outsize share relative to your key competitors?\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. Thanks, David. So yeah, in the first quarter, I think I said that we expected not to get back to flat yet for the IOM on a two year basis. And obviously to your point, we did better than that. Certainly at the time, one of the things we're guessing or we're guessing is when each of the markets would reopen, based on regulations going on at the time with no end dates, or knowing exactly when they'd allow markets to reopen. So some of the markets were able to reopen a little bit earlier than we had originally anticipated, whether that's certain channels or all channels. And the other thing that we are seeing is that when we do reopen, business comes back quickly. And so, there's certainly a pent-up demand in some of those markets that had shutdowns again, primarily in Europe. And so, we are seeing when those markets reopen, there's significant demand that's waiting to come back, whether that's through the drive-through, whether that's in-store. And as you know, we have a higher percentage of in-restaurant or in-store business in Europe than we do in the U.S. So it was really important to get the dining rooms reopen throughout Europe. So that demand and reopening plans, I'd say have gone a little bit better than we were first anticipating in the first quarter. And now our expectation is, as long as we don't go backwards on lockdowns again, which obviously is a still a little bit of a risk, but assuming that none of the markets go back through lockdowns, we feel good about continuing the momentum that in all of those markets.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Chris and Kevin, at your investor event in December, you laid out some targets for G&A and CapEx and some of that was associated with some technology spending you would be doing some asset upgrades. Has your thoughts involved on how much you need to spend to achieve these goals? I'm thinking about technology, are you better off outsourcing some of this given how fast it moves versus in-sourcing, which has been a pressure on the G&A line? Just an updated thoughts on that, particularly as your digital journey has gone six months further, versus when you last talked about those targets?\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah, I'll start off John, and then pass it to Kevin for any other thoughts. But I think if you go back to what we announced, and certainly we were anticipating in some of our guidance there, how we expected the business to evolve over kind of the next three years or so. And so, I think from a G&A standpoint, we're very much I think on track with G&A. I do think that there is probably a balance toward maybe getting a little bit more that we outsource versus in source on that. And it's about for us ultimately giving the best customer experience. So it's not for us driven by trying to hit a number per se, but it's about delivering the best customer experience. I think when you can pick best of breed suppliers from out there in the industry, our experience has been that that does tend to work a little bit better. We referenced previously, we do think we'll probably be on the higher end of capital spend from the guidance standpoint, just because of a unique growth opportunity out there. But I don't think you're going to see anything that's dramatically different from what we talked about last year. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything to add?\nKevin Ozan: No, I would just reiterate that what we talked about for 2022, we obviously haven't done our kind of detailed planning yet for 2022. But the initial guidance we gave, both for G&A and capital, I think still is pretty much intact, which is kind of the G&A as a percent of sales and the total capital envelope of around $2.3 billion or so. So, none of that has changed really. And then, I think, as we talked about in the investor event, we would expect to get leverage, certainly on G&A as a percent of sales longer-term, because what we're seeing on the technology spend is, I don't think the actual spend levels will go down, but I don't expect it to go significantly up either. So as sales grow, certainly we should get more leverage as a percent of sales. But, I think the technology will require a significant amount of ongoing spend going forward, which is why we believe we've got an advantage just from the size and scale aspect.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just getting back to the inflationary environment topic, clearly the franchise model helps to insulate corporate. But just wondering how we think about your outlook for the system in terms of commodities and labor, global effects 12-plus months, as a system your size, I would think you'd be a pioneer have pretty good visibility. The pressures are outsized, which I would presume I'm just wondering how those conversations go with franchisees. And then you mentioned that the cash flow or profitability that peaks, but do you think the messages that you prefer to maybe take a hit to the margin to sustain the strong sales momentum? Or are there incremental cost savings? Or, do you consider incremental menu pricing, just wondering how you think about that, based on what your outlook is for commodities and labor over the next 12-plus months? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, in 2021, we're seeing pretty muted inflation, it's, call it 1% to 2%. Now, we're hedged in a lot of our categories there, so we're benefiting from that. It's probably a little too early for us to give an outlook to what 2022 looks like. We typically have that number that we start talking about with franchisees in October. And, we certainly hear and recognize some of the challenges that are out there from an inflation standpoint. But we also have, as you mentioned in your question, things to our advantage around our size and some of the relationships that we have with our suppliers that, we think that there are going to be ways that we can perhaps offset some of that. So, I think it's right now a little bit premature to say necessarily that we're going to be in a significant inflationary environment next year. I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to manage that to something that is a little bit more in line with kind of our historical range that we've seen on that.  We are seeing challenges related to some of the supply chain issues. But it's on the equipment side, particularly, so it's equipment, getting equipment manufactured in Asia, getting that over into markets that maybe have bigger unit growth, aspirations. We're also seeing the chip shortage as something that's rippling through a little bit on the equipment side. So, we are closely monitoring what's happening with equipment, and just making sure that we've got the plans in place there, because that tends to be a longer lead item on things. From a pricing standpoint, I would lastly just say, the pricing that we've taken this year, roughly around 6% or so I think in the U.S., that is about in line, maybe a little bit ahead of where the overall inflation is when you add in the labor inflation with food inflation. So I think our system is being disciplined. And they certainly recognize that, we can't get ahead of where the customer is. And we've got to make sure that we stay competitive on pricing.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'd add is, that 6% that Chris just threw out that's year-over-year, second quarter this year versus last year. Most of that was pricing that was taken over the last year, because we only increased prices about 0.5% actually in the second quarter. And as Chris mentioned, a lot of that has been driven by labor inflation pressure along with some food cost increases. But, as he said, we're pretty locked in with price costs, commodity costs for this year. So we feel good about that. Certainly, if the inflation pressures continue into next year that would impact everyone, including us. But right now, I think we feel pretty good about where we are.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Guggenheim.\nGreg Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. Maybe just a follow-up to that. I know your company margins in the U.S. were 400 to 600 basis points, but I assume the franchisees are probably similar. How do you think that I guess trends over time? Do you think franchisees will underprice peers to try to take share? Does that get reinvested into labor? Or, do you kind of run it at a higher margin rate permanently? I'm just trying to think about how that dynamic plays out in terms of reinvestment over time. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah, thanks for the question, Greg. A couple of things, on margins, I guess, let me start with company margins. Because, I think you guys maybe use those as a proxy for how the franchisees are doing. Certainly, we had very strong company margins in the second quarter here, some of that being driven by the higher average check. I think as we progress, we expect that to moderate a little bit, one from the higher wages that just began in the second quarter and will continue, obviously. And two, we think there may be some moderation on the average check, although we haven't seen that yet. But I think we're anticipating average check potentially to come down a little bit. From the franchisees side, as I mentioned, they still have record operating cash flow through May of this year. They are up over $100,000 in their cash flow over last year. So they certainly have the financial strength to be able to continue to reinvest in the business. And I think, in general on pricing, both we and our franchisees take a more consumer research-based approach than we would have several years ago. And so, it's based on consumer research, it looks at local prevailing market conditions, it looks at the competitive set within each area and then franchisees and the company obviously each make our own pricing decisions after that. But I think overall, we feel pretty good about the margins. But I would expect the U.S. to moderate a little bit from where we were in the second quarter.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from Pete Saleh with BTIG.\nPete Saleh: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the dining rooms and the reopening of dining rooms. I think you guys said 70% of dining rooms are open today and you expect 100% by Labor Day. Are you guys getting any pushback from franchisees on this issue, given the ongoing staffing issues and really the record cash flows that they're experiencing? Just wondering if they see any reason to reopen their dining rooms.\nChris Kempczinski: I think our franchisees recognize that the dining experience is an important part of what we offer at McDonald's. And certainly as we look at our competitors, we're also seeing that they have in many cases, their dining rooms open. So, I think our franchisees certainly understand that we need to get the dining rooms open. I think the question that you're kind of referencing here is just about the pacing of it. We're 70% open today and on our way toward getting to 100%. There is difficulty, as I mentioned earlier about some of the staffing so that is I think one thing that maybe is a little bit of a moderating effect on the pace that we've been able to get our dining rooms open. But broadly, there's not pushed back, there's not anybody kind of questioning why we need to have dining rooms open. It's a key part of what we offer here at McDonald's. We just have to work through some of the kind of what I would call transitory issues right now to just be able to get there by September.\nKevin Ozan: And it is helpful obviously, to just relieve some pressure in the drive-through certainly to help in the dining rooms. We are seeing not sales levels go back to where they were in the dining room pre-pandemic, but certainly some of the drive-through sales are transferring over to dining rooms when we do reopen those.\nChris Kempczinski: I would just maybe last thing on this, I mean, we are seeing a lift. When you open the dining room, you get a sales lift. And I think that more than anything is probably what will motivate franchisees to get the dining rooms open.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. On digital, the U.S. offers such great convenience and access with 95% drive-throughs across the asset base. So what is your confidence in being able to drive an increase in digital utilization through your direct digital channels, given already such great access? And then, is there anything you can share on the frequency of an average McDonald's customer, or to what extent drive-through transactions are impulse buys versus planned purchases?\nChris Kempczinski: So, first what gives us confidence, I think it's just what we're seeing with customer reaction to loyalty already. We have as you've referenced a great drive-through business. But consumers and particularly younger consumers increasingly are looking at the app as sort of the way that they want to be interacting with McDonald's. And so far ability to actually have the app connect through the drive-through to be able to have loyalty be embedded in part of the drive-through experience, I think all of these things are part of the vision of these different service channels, different ways of accessing McDonald's, they all have to work kind of seamlessly together on that. And we're seeing good uptick. I mean, we had targets around where we wanted to see digital guest counts in restaurants, not just in the U.S., but around the globe. And we are either meeting or exceeding the growth that we're looking for in our digital guest count. So the customer is responding, the customer is excited about having a digital relationship with McDonald's, and they see the power of what the app can do for personalizing their experience. So that's what gives me confidence. It's just the numbers that we're seeing as a part of this. As to the question around drive-through, maybe I'll have that be something that Kevin answers on just purchase impulse.\nKevin Ozan: Well, the only thing I'd say is, like the loyalty program that obviously we just launched, what we saw in our pilots are that loyalty did drive digital adoption, and also shorter purchase cycles or greater frequency of visits, if you will, of loyal customers. So we have seen that the digital engagement will generally drive people to the loyal customers, certainly, to return more frequently than they would have otherwise. So the digital engagement is just another piece of the whole ecosystem, as Chris talked about. And there are people that do plan the outings in addition to obviously, the impulse drive-through sales.\nChris Kempczinski: And as we said in the release, we had $8 billion of digital sales in the first-half of the year, it's up 70%. So again, it goes back to the point, what gives me confidence is just the business results that we're seeing and the customer response to it.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. Two related questions, related points, I guess. In certain markets, like France have talked about vaccine passports, I guess, beginning in September, I think. What do you understand that to actually mean, if you were to actually have to enforce that in terms of how that you could potentially impact in-store consumption of your product? That\u2019s kind of the first point. And, as we think about these franchisees that maybe you need to put some technology and staffing around that. Is there any thought that some of your increased technology spending that you've been talking about things that are obviously very value added for the franchisee could over time be offset by some increase in the franchise revenue that you receive? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: So, I think your first question about what's happening at the country level, vaccine passport success, I would hate to even hazard a guess. Because, it seems like it's changing by the week, sometimes by the day on that. I think what we've shown though through the last 18-months is the ability of our system, when they're having to deal with different things at the local level, for our ability to respond to the system. And I think that's just, again, goes back to being a franchise business, having local owner operators that are able to kind of make these adjustments and pivot there. So again, I hate to hazard sort of what's going to happen, where and when, and how that impacts us. I think, I would just point out again that we've done a pretty good job, I think of navigating a whole bunch of changes over the last 18-months. And that certainly gives me confidence, as we look forward on sort of what the next phase of this looks like. From the standpoint of the things that we're talking about, and ways to deliver value to the franchisees, I think for us, we're certainly not looking at any of these things through the lens of who pays for what, and an opportunity to maybe go after anything on the revenue side there from a franchise standpoint, because frankly, we're too far away from any of that. So Apprente earlier, Apprente is still going to require significant work to go from 10 restaurants, to what ends up being hopefully 10,000 restaurants in the U.S. And as you get a better sense of what that might deliver as labor savings, what the cost of that, all those things we need to learn a lot more before we would ever contemplate what that means between the profit split with us and franchisees. So, premature for us to have any thoughts or conversations on that.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I just wanted to ask for a clarification on the previous point on the drive-through times in the U.S. And then I have a question on your McOpCo margins broadly. You mentioned how the drive-through times that improved by 30 seconds or so, and I think you mentioned that much of that had gone away. My understanding that a good bit of that might have been because of the loyalty launch, if you're talking, particularly in recent weeks. So I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that. And if you're experiencing that improves in the test markets as you get through the launch phase, that would be helpful as well. And then and then with regard to McOpCo, 70% or so of your McOpCo stores are in the IOM. And clearly, that's a market that's just getting going. You had near peak levels of McOpCo margins in the second quarter. I guess my question is where can that go broadly? Do you think you're going to get to new peaks in McOpCo margins on a global basis? Are there productivity reasons for this beyond what's just going in terms of like the dining rooms being temporarily closed, and I'll stop there. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: I'll do the service time and then I'll let Kevin handle the McOpCo margin. So on service time, just to be clear, so we did as I mentioned, we saw a 32nd improvement over the last few years. More recently, the three seconds slow down, that's off of the 32nd improvement, so call it a net 27 seconds improvement on that. The opportunity for us is as you may remember at the end of last year, David, when we had our Investor Day, we set an aspiration of getting another 20 seconds or so of speed, improve service time through the drive-through and the staffing changes have slowed some of the trajectory of improvement that we're seeing there. But, I certainly expect that we're going to be able to get back on continuing to whittle away at service times. I know that's what all the markets, including the U.S. are focused on. So it's more of just a slowing down of the improvement. There's certainly no meaningful going backward on this thing. And it's just the gains were too hard, but nobody's going to be willing to give up on service times. Kevin?\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. And then on McOpCo margins, a couple things, as you mentioned, obviously, a lot of our McOpCos are over in Europe in the IOM segment. And we had strong margins, certainly in the second quarter. I would expect improvement in IOM margins over the course of the rest of the year. I don't know that we will get back to pre-COVID margins yet for this year, just because obviously, first quarter was still obviously pretty low as a lot of the restaurants were still had some restrictions, whether completely shut down or not. I do think going forward, there is opportunity to continue growing those international margins, at least back to historical levels, and potentially even a little higher, because of some of the efficiencies you've talked about, as well as average check is still a little bit elevated. And those two things combined are helping both the U.S. and our IOM McOpCos. So I do think there's opportunity to potentially on a global basis exceed our historical high margins.\nChris Kempczinski: Hey, David, let me come back. Your friend Mike Cieplak here made sure I answer to your question in full. You had a question also about loyalty and impact on service time, so we are seeing when we introduce loyalty, it has a modest impact on service times about 10 seconds. But over kind of six to eight weeks, as both customers and crew get accustomed to it, we're able to pretty much whittle that back down to neutral on that. So there is an initial service time impact. But again, over six to eight weeks, we're able to work that out of the system.\nA \u2013 Mike Cieplak: We have time for one more question. We'll go to Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Michael on for Jared. One quick last question here, you guys have spoken a little bit about the importance of dining reopening to the business more broadly. But with increasing the digital side of the business, and you have the strength in drive-through and some of those tech enhancements, are you guys thinking all about new formats, whether that's domestic or internationally, maybe to help accelerate growth in the future, non-traditional, et cetera? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Well, I think that's going to be one of the big areas for Manu to think about and look at is, do we need to think about format innovation as being part of how we offer this more seamless customer experience. We got different things out there in different markets, looking at no dining room as an example, delivery and drive-through only, restaurants. I know several years ago, we talked to you about MC Originals in France, which was a limited menu. So we've always got things that the markets are kind of experimenting with from a format standpoint, but part of Manu\u2019s mandate is going to be to take a look at all of that, to understand the customer experience we want to provide, and if new format needs to be a part of that to be able to introduce that. I do think if we do anything on new format, it's going to be smaller footprint lower cost than what we have today. But again, Manu will probably at some point in the future be able to share with you more on that.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. That completes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Kevin. Thanks, everyone for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-29 15:55:38", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's First Quarter 2021 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan; and President of McDonald's USA, Joe Erlinger. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. As are any reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will open the queue for your questions. I ask that you please limit yourself to one question and if you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. It was a year ago this week that we had our first earnings call of the COVID-19 pandemic. We\u2019d just begun to experience the closings, openings and constantly changing regulations that would come to define in the past year. I said then that in the face of such enormous challenges, I was immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system. Franchisees, crew members suppliers and company employees banded together and continued to feed and foster communities amidst unprecedented change and disruption. My pride has only grown since then. Through the pandemic, we've seen the power of the McDonald's System and our franchise model at work. We are one of the world's most global corporation, but also one of the most local. Serving 10s of millions of customers each day, across almost 40,000 local restaurants. That's our secret sauce. And it's hard to imagine how we would have adapted to the constantly changing circumstances of the past year, if we were not a locally owned locally managed system, rooted in the communities where we operate. That ability to adapt enabled us to build a system playbook that tapped into our operating prowess and synthesize learnings from individual markets. We put our customers and people first and found ways to ensure their safety and security amidst the global health crisis. We leaned into our historical strength like our core menu and drive through to continue serving our communities creating feel good moments that were more welcome and needed than ever. At the same time we kept innovating in areas like digital and delivery, to offer customers new ways to safely connect with our brand and deepen our ability to meet their personalized needs. And we used our marketing muscle to keep the Golden Arches shining brightly, reminding people of their enduring trust in our brand and our purpose to feed and foster communities. Importantly, we did it all with the commitment to transparency. Every step of the way, we gave our stakeholders a clear sense of what we were doing and why we were doing it. That communication was made easier by our refresh values that captured the essence of the McDonald's System and how we operate. No matter where you are in the world, our McDonald's values serve as the glue that unites us and guides our every decision. We put our people and customers first. We open our doors to everyone. We do the right thing. We're good neighbors and we get better together. Five simple statements that capture the essence of the company, Ray Kroc founded over 65 years ago. Our renewed focus on these values has kicked off a virtuous cycle. Energizing our workforce and attracting new leaders who embody these qualities and are inspired by our purpose. That includes Desiree Ralls-Morrison, who joined the team earlier this week as our new General Counsel. Turning to our business performance, despite resurgences and continued operating restrictions in many parts of the world, I'm pleased to share that in the first quarter, global comp sales and revenues have already surpassed Q1 2019 levels. Not surprisingly, we expect McDonald's to deliver strong global comp sales and revenue growth against 2019 levels for the full year, reflecting the strength of our business and the pent-up customer demand. We are seeing as markets reopen. Specifically in Q1, global comp sales for the quarter were up 7.5%, with each of our segments achieved positive comp sales. And we will hear in a moment from our US segment President Joe Erlinger that improvement was largely driven by the US, with comp sales up 13.6% for the quarter. In Europe, we continue to face a tough operating environment, which is impacting recovery of cost some of our top markets in the IOM segment. And we'll talk about our international performance in a minute. We remain laser focused on achieving the sustainable growth plan laid out and accelerating the arches. Likewise, our three growth pillars MC&D continue to serve as both a guide and an engine for our path forward. We are maximizing our marketing to stay relevant and find those connection points with customers that will pay off in a big way. We're also committing to our core menu making the chicken burgers and coffee our customers love even more delicious. In a moment, Joe will talk about the successful launch of the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich. Finally, we are doubling down on digital delivery and drive through. We're creating a faster easier better customer experience. However, our customers want to interact with us, whether at the counter through drive-through window or on the app, dining in the restaurant or having that meal delivered to them we will offer experiences they love and that we believe will keep them coming back. Over the past four years, we went from just over 3,000 restaurants offering delivery to now more than 30,000 restaurants or 75% of our global footprint. We're excited about our success with multiple 3PL partners and we continue to innovate. That includes testing self-delivery models in select markets and identifying ways to improve restaurant operations for deliveries, so that customer experience will get better and better. Drive-through made McDonald's where it is today. The drive-throughs in 25,000 of our restaurants worldwide are a huge part of who we are. And why we've been able to continue safely serving millions of customers each day this past year. And since the pandemic began, we've leaned into this competitive advantage by continuing to improve drive-through service times by putting more emphasis on operations and reducing menu complexity. We also see digital as an important channel to improve speed and convenience, provide customers with more personalization and offer even better value. We have 40 million active app users in just our top 6 markets and millions more around the world. Our goal is to make sure that no matter how customers interact with us, they have a seamless and consistently enjoyable experience. One key lever in reaching our digital ambition is loyalty. In addition of France and a few other markets which already have loyalty, we are currently piloting our new loyalty program, My McDonald's rewards in the US and Germany with plan to deploy later this year. What inspires me the most about our digital transformation is that we constantly have the opportunity and ability to become even more relevant in our customers' everyday routines. The power of our growth pillars come to life not in isolation but in combination. The success of our Famous Orders program is a great example of how the three pillars, our MC&D are deeply interconnected reinforcing and bolstering one another. In last week's announcement that we're partnering with Super Group BTS from South Korea to offer fans in nearly 50 countries their favorite McDonald's order, shines a powerful light on a simple truth. In every country where we operate from every walk of life and in almost every stage of life, you have your go-to-McDonald's order. This is much more than your traditional promotional partnership for one it will harness the scale of McDonald's and the relevance of authentic fans like BTS. I think it's fair to say that few other brands have the cultural relevance and global appeal to pull off this kind of partnership, that's the power of brand McDonald's. Famous Orders takes that universal insight of everyone's unique go-to-McDonald's order, celebrates our fans love of the core menu and brings it to life through digital activations. The BTS Army will soon experience the M, the C and the D of our plan, in a way that authentically taps into their love of these two global icons. And it doesn't stop there. Whether through successful traffic generating promotions like digital calendars in Australia or Germany, building on the strength of core equities with line extensions like Katsu curry Chicken McNuggets and Grand Big Mac in the UK we're piloting the McDonald's Rewards loyalty program. We continue to deepen our connection with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable experience. Let's turn it over to Joe to tell us what that experience is looking like in the US. Joe?\nJoe Erlinger: Thanks, Chris. Our US business ended 2020 in a position of strength and that carried into the first quarter, delivering a 13.6% comp sales increase with double-digit positive comps across all dayparts. We exited Q1 with historically high average daily sales volumes. And the record high operating cash flow, our franchisees experienced in 2020 continued in Q1. While we have seen some benefit from consumers receiving government stimulus checks during the first quarter, our results are truly a testament to the hard work happening each day in our restaurants. I recently been in our restaurants and Maine and Massachusetts and you can feel the energy and excitement. Our franchisees and importantly their restaurant teams are focused on keeping our crew and customer safe. In addition, they are delivering gold standard execution, especially around chicken and the 3 D's and this has led to higher customer satisfaction scores. I want to give a special thank you to our owner operators in restaurant teams, for all they've done during extremely challenging times. Our growth plans in the US are rooted in the Accelerating the Arches strategy and focused on the MCD framework. As for our results, the quarterly performance is a product of the accumulation of what we've done over the past 12 months and not because of any one action we took during the quarter or four-week marketing window. The values and brand based decisions we've made along with simplifying our menus strengthening our digital business and re-committing to our core, are having a multiplier effect. I've seen this recipe for success in several markets during my time overseas. And I'm confident that the right pieces are in place for our US business to sustain results. Let me pull back the lens and give you some examples. Driving customer visits begins with committing to the core menu. Early in the pandemic, the US business removed dozens of menu items. As a result of this focus our drive-through's got faster, margins grew and customer satisfaction improved. Put simply, our restaurants became easier to run and more profitable. Reducing complexity set the stage for the right investments in the core, beginning last fall with spicy chicken McNuggets which we brought back for a limited time in February. They drove customer excitement and comp sales growth during the quarter. Then in late February, we introduced our Crispy Chicken Sandwich line of three delicious new sandwiches. The beginning of our multiyear chicken journey. While the category is very competitive, we are so far exceeding our projections. We were selling substantially more chicken sandwiches compared to our previous Chicken Sandwich line and seeing strong unit movement, especially after 4:00 PM. Our success of the demonstration of McDonald's at its best, with all 3 legs of the stool working together. First, we develop the platform and build the supply chain. We then align the system around the opportunity. And finally, we created, engaging and exciting, marketing, PR and social media plans nationally and across our 10 field offices. Today we're learning from each other and working to transfer the success we're seeing in our top restaurants to all restaurants. We expect to refresh and sustain this platform, and do so in a very culturally relevant way throughout the rest of 2021. At the same time we doubled down on the 3 D's digital, delivery and drive through. With COVID as the catalyst for consumer behavior shift, we experienced an absolute surge in off-premise dining. We drove our digital sales mix and app usage. In the first quarter, we had nearly 1.5 billion in digital sales, which includes app, kiosk and delivery. And we now have over 20 million active app users with loyalty yet to come. We grew delivery to an all-time high in dollars and sales mix. And we continue to reduce overall experience times especially impressive given the increased volume of business we experienced through the drive through. Chris mentioned the Famous Orders platform earlier. Nothing had a greater impact on our digital business, than the introduction of this program last year. We've retained many of the digital customers acquired during those Famous Order promotions and the US business is very excited about the upcoming BTS meal, which continues to maximize our digital investments without adding any restaurant complexity. And with that foundation, we are well positioned heading into our loyalty program launch later this summer. When we built my McDonald's rewards, our goal was to create a platform that elevated our brand excited our customers and engaged our crew and we did just that. In our two test and learn markets, Phoenix and New England, we're encouraged by the initial results. User adoption as measured by guests ordering through the app are up significantly since the test began. Frequency has increased. In fact, our loyalty, customers are far more likely to return in the next 30 days compared to non-loyalty customers, and customer satisfaction is up. Customers love the personalized experience of being treated by their first name. We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from restaurant crew, not only on the program itself but the ways in which we've train them for example using digital simulations. Of course, as in any test we've captured many learnings around training operations and deployment that will help us maximize the impact when we launched this nationally. As I close, I want to reiterate that there is not one single reason for our success. The accumulation of our decisions grounded in our values return to the US business to a place of brand relevancy for our customers and meaning for our people and has provided us a strong foundation towards sustained business growth. And now, I will turn it over to Kevin to talk about our international performance and our financial results.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Joe. As Chris mentioned earlier global comp sales and revenues for the quarter surpassed Q1 2019 pre-pandemic levels, largely driven by the US. For the quarter, global comp sales increased 7.5% with growth across all segments. And comps were up significantly in March as we started to lap the impact of COVID-19. In the IOM segment, comp sales were up 60 basis points in Q1. With widespread resurgences and ongoing government restrictions across Europe including dining room closures and reduced operating hours, the segment has not fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. As a result of the restrictions we saw varied performance across the markets. Strong results continued in Australia as customer mobility has mostly recovered and the country remains nearly COVID free. The market benefited from sales of their new chicken line along with successful LTO line extensions on core burgers. And average check has continued to hold up with sustained growth in delivery and drive thru sales and a shift into more core and premium menu items. Comp sales were positive for the UK and Canada for the quarter and surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Despite UK's national stay at home order for nearly all of Q1 and Canada's recent surge in COVID infections both markets have successfully leveraged the competitive advantages of our 3 D's to grow sales. And in France and Germany comps were negative for the quarter as dining rooms were closed and curfews were in place. Government restrictions are expected to ease somewhat in Q2, but we don't expect these markets to recover to pre-COVID sales levels until later in the year. Comp sales in the IDL segment were up 6.4% for the quarter, with growth across nearly all geographies. Performance was largely driven by positive results in China and Japan. In China comps were up significantly for the quarter, as we comped over COVID impacts from February and March last year. By leveraging their large digital members base, China compelling digital offers contributing the results for the quarter, as they continue on the path to recovery. In addition, China opened 150 new restaurants in Q1, keeping on pace to open nearly 500 new restaurants this year. Japan maintained momentum in Q1 with comps up 9% and that's on top of over 5% growth last year as a strong balance of core, value and family related promotions resonated with customers. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect the US to continue to outpace 2019 with two-year comp sales growth relatively in line with Q1. In the IOM segment, we expect the two-year growth rate to improve over Q1, but the segment will likely continue to lag 2019 until the second half of the year. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect full year system-wide sales growth in the mid-teens in constant currencies. While we continue to see pandemic related stops and starts in markets around the world. Impacting customer behavior and our business, so there is still some uncertainty. Turning to earnings, adjusted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.92, up 27% in constant currencies. And adjusted operating margin was 41.9%, reflecting improved sales performance higher other operating income and lower G&A costs compared to last year. Total restaurant margin dollars increased 10% in constant currencies, with improvement in both franchise and company-operated restaurant margins. Franchise margin dollars grew by over $170 million in constant currencies. Mostly from the strong sales performance in the US. And company operated margins in the US were strong as we continue to see top line growth driven from higher average check. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the US margins to moderate somewhat as check growth tempers and we reopen dining rooms. In the IOM segment company operated margins improved in Q1. With the ongoing impact of COVID on the segment, we don't expect to get back to full-year pre-COVID margin levels this year. This is a result of near-term sales and cost pressures but there is nothing structural to prevent us from returning to pre-COVID margins longer term. Turning to G&A, Chris and Joe, both talked about the contributions from digital on our results. And we continue to invest in this important area to fuel growth. For the quarter G&A was down 6% in constant currencies, due to some one-time costs we incurred in the first quarter last year. As a result of our strong start to the year, we're now expecting higher incentive-based compensation. So, for the full year, we expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales. Because of this increased to incentive-based comp just relates to current year performance, it will only impact this year's G&A. Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter and we're still projecting a full year rate in the range of 21% to 23% with some fluctuation across the quarters. And finally foreign currency translation benefited Q1 results by $0.06 per share based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to benefit EPS by about $0.10 for Q2 with an estimated full year tailwind of $0.24 to $0.26. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year. I'm pleased with our global recovery to date. Even as we face resurgence restricted operations around the world. And I'm confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth in the business. Now, I'll turn it back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. I want to close by saying once again how proud I am of everything our system has accomplished and continues to do amidst such difficult circumstances. If last year was about defining who we are, what we stand for and where we're going this year is about execution and how we're going to get there. Every year we check in with our staff to get their feedback on the work that's happening. In our latest survey results received last week almost 90% of employees expressed strong confidence in our business. And just as importantly they agreed that we were abiding by each of our core values. And just a few weeks ago, we held our Annual Leadership Summit virtually bringing together, our top 50 field and corporate leaders. Across each of our markets and amongst this leadership group, there were strong alignment against our Accelerating the Arches strategy and universal recognition that our continued success depends on great execution. Back in November, at our Investor Day, I said that distinctions between the corporate brand and the consumer brand are blurry. They are now two sides of the same coin and you can't build an inclusive family focus global consumer brand like McDonald's unless the corporations actions give evidence to those attributes. That's why in February we said 5 and 10-year goals for increasing diversity and leadership across our Corporation. Research has shown that businesses that prioritize DEI, recruit and retain stronger talent unlock greater innovative potential and bolster financial performance. And we are committed to making measurable progress in disclosing representation data to hold ourselves accountable for results by tying a portion of executive compensation to making progress in this area. Earlier this month, we also shared global brand standards, designed to reinforce a culture of safety and inclusion. We want, employees and customers to feel safe and protected and it's critically important to be clear that violence harassment and discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. All 39,000 McDonald's restaurants across the globe including company owned and franchise locations will be required to uphold these standards. We're continuing to put resources and tools in place to help restaurants implement these changes and ensured these standards are met. Beginning in January 2022 restaurant will be assessed in accordance with the applicable McDonald's market business evaluation processes. We understand that the way we show up in our communities and for stakeholders impacts the way customers see us and their trust in us. We have to make sure our values of the lived experience of everyone who interacts with our brand. We've seen powerful examples of service and dedication on display across the McDonald's system during the most difficult year we've ever experienced. Around the world, our people have embodied the belief that we must all pitch in and help one another. They take pride in that and they should. While we all remain hopeful that this will be a year when life begins to return to some version of normal. We know the operating environment remains volatile. We expect that there will be stops and starts that impact results, but as we see even during the most difficult moments last year, delicious feel-good moments for McDonald's remain high in demand. We will continue to lean forward and make bold bets in our future. I believe more strongly than ever. As I said in November that this is the start of something new for McDonald's. As we continue to Accelerate the Arches lead with our values and serve our customers and communities, I look forward to seeing with the McFamily can accomplish in the months ahead. And I look forward to seeing our global system come together in person next April in Orlando, for our Global 2022 worldwide convention. And with that, we'll begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks. And Good morning to you. My question is on the health of the European consumer and how - how you think about the recovery. So, we have a lot of data, obviously on the US and we see it in the numbers. I'm asking I guess if you can tease out between the closures and restrictions how do you think the consumer is there particularly in your Continental European markets? What do you think you need to do differently on reopening, is value going to be more important, how do you think - is it as simple as reopening or do you think there is a lag from a consumer response perspective in those markets as well? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Hi, John, it's Chris. Good morning. And I think on the European market to start with, it's difficult to talk about it as sort of one single market. I think you have to break it into kind of the - each of the big markets there. And it varies in the case of the UK, we're seeing the UK consumer is quite strong, that business is performing well. Markets that are heavily tourist dependent, however, like Spain, Italy, France, those markets are struggling and so I think for us, part of what we believe is that this summer we do think that many of the European markets are going to start opening up, there has been some commentary about perhaps a vaccine passport that allows for travel within the European market, that I think will have a big impact and help on stimulating those markets that maybe have had a little bit more of a headwind. And then I think for us the key is about also getting the dining rooms open, our dining rooms are closed in about 50% of our restaurants in Europe, as you know, dining rooms for dine-in is a big part of our European business, and so getting those open I think will be another important step for us in getting momentum back into the European business, but from a consumer standpoint in terms of just the outlook, I think it's probably best described as being concerned about an anxious about many of the things that are coming with COVID. But I think also there is pent-up demand that we've seen. When we do - when we are able to get a market open or even last year when we had some re-openings that then resulted in closures, not too long thereafter, the second and third wave came about, that there is nothing that gives us any concern that as we reopen that we're going to see the same pent-up demand come back and get the European business moving forward.\nOperator: Next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. My question is on the US business and really wanted to get your thoughts on how much you think the stimulus might be helping the trends in the US. And then secondly, what are you assuming in your guidance either for the remainder of Q2 or the remainder of the year, as it relates to the health of the consumer and whether the current momentum in the business can carry through for the rest of the year.\nChris Kempczinski: So why don't we have Joe talk about kind of what we're seeing right now and then Kevin can touch a little bit on what's in the guidance.\nJoe Erlinger: Thanks, David and thanks for the question. Relative to the stimulus checks, there is no question that it did benefit our business. But I think as I shared in my prepared comments, the positivity that we saw in the first quarter was way beyond just stimulus checks, was that accumulation of all the things that we've done over the last 12 months that's put us in a very strong position. I think you can also argue that the stimulus checks are now wearing off generally, but we're seeing continued momentum in our business. And as Kevin said, we expect our second quarter two-year stack to be roughly the same as our first quarter stack.\nKevin Ozan: I wasn't going to say much more other than - I think going forward to Joe's point I think consumers in the US still are fairly healthy, it's certainly helpful for us obviously when they've got money in their pockets and stimulus definitely helped in the first quarter, but we are seeing when we do reopen dining rooms, even in the US that consumers are ready to come back to visit in the dining rooms and have some money to spend. And so, I don't think we have a big concern right now about consumer ability to be able to spend.\nOperator: Next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great, thanks for the question. Chris and Joe just another one on the US where you've got very strong momentum clearly and based on the plan that you outlined, it seems like that the momentum continues for the year and beyond, but wondering just if you could help frame your expectations for the coming quarters as the US continues to reopen and you think about other restaurant options reopening, how do you think about tailwinds-headwinds, you're getting your own benefits as it relates to that reopening, I assume, how you're thinking about that and just kind of building on that and, just Joe, you kind of talked, I think about the US relative maybe to some other really strong countries internationally. I'm just wondering if you could draw some parallels there for the potential for kind of multi-year period of outperformance in this US business maybe than where you have with some of the other really strong countries outside of the US historically?\nJoe Erlinger: Yes, thanks, thanks for the question. I mean there is no question that as you think back to the initial onset of the pandemic, there was a surge in off-premise dining and we were set up incredibly well, given the investments that we've made historically in digital delivery and drive thru, within the US business to succeed in that environment and that's exactly, obviously what we've done. Beyond that, though, obviously we've made some great investments in chicken, great investments in the core, that have begun to really set us up well for the future and we continue to have our prowess around value. As you begin to look forward, we think there is no question that the consumer is going to want to come back into dining rooms, Chris has already mentioned it in Europe, but we think it's the case in the US as well. So, we will continue to open our dining rooms. But we want to do it in a way that really that really drive sales and making an event almost as we reopened our dining rooms, because it was 90%+ of our business, being through the drive thru if we can - if we can sustain that and return our dining rooms and take away to levels that they were pre-pandemic we've set ourselves up for a very good run here.  In terms of parallels between the US business, other successful markets overseas, it's never one lever, Dennis, it's always a combination of things that are put together in concert such that you're not dependent upon the next promotion or the next deal that you do and this is this idea underlying baseline momentum and so, we're feeling the benefits of that underlying baseline momentum in the US, that I saw in many international markets as they set themselves up for multi-year runs and I think that's where we are.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, good morning, thanks for the question. Clearly the stimulus provides a nice boost to industry sales in recent weeks, but on the flip side, the labor pool seems have shrunk. How are your franchisees handling the labor shortages and what is your expectation for labor inflation this year and also do you see this as a temporary step-up that might recede after the supplemental unemployment benefits go away or are you looking at this is more of a permanent environment, speaking about the specific staffing issues restaurant operators are facing today. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Hey, Eric. Well, I think you have accurately characterized what we're seeing in the US right now, it's definitely a very tight labor market that's putting pressure on both us and our franchisees. I think one of the things that we are thinking about and I'll have Joe talked about it is in our company-owned restaurants, how do we think about what is the pay and benefits package need to look like for us to make sure that we're able to get the people that we need and then - Joe can also talk about how franchisees are addressing that.\nJoe Erlinger: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Chris and Eric. Thanks for the question. Yes, about 2 weeks ago, we actually came together on a system webcast, because obviously across 14,000 restaurants and nearly 2000 franchisees while there might be some general struggles, there are also some specific best practices in specific areas where we are succeeding. And so there were opportunities for our franchisees to talk to their fellow franchisees about the things that they're doing that are yielding success and that's always been one of the hallmarks of our system and we can take a best practice from one restaurant and try to get it to all restaurants, it yields real benefits. Interestingly, we are faring a bit better in our company-owned restaurants, as Chris mentioned, we have higher crew sizes overall than the average franchisee. We recognize that we need to continue to stay a little bit ahead of things on this on this topic. And so we're working through what some changes in our company owned restaurants might look like from a wages and compensation perspective. We think the external environment is right to do this, we think the internal environment is also right to do this and we think it's actually a great business decision for us.\nOperator: Next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thank you. Maybe looking back a little bit, the International operating margin markets you saw four consecutive years of 3% comp growth and positive traffic in 2015 through 2018 after the EOTF remodels hit a tipping point and you just kind of feel that the US is kind of at the start of this that the remodel program is substantially complete and you've got this traction over the last year with digital in the early success of loyalty program that's coming this summer. So thinking about - thinking forward 2022 and beyond, am I wrong to think the business seems poised to go through this tipping point and is there something unique about the IOM that would prohibit the US from delivering similar 3%+ comps in 2022 and beyond. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Andrew. We'll certainly what we are - what we embarked on in the US, several years ago drew a lot on the learnings that we had seen in our European or IOM markets and a key feature of that was the EOTF program. I think the fact that we've been able to get almost all of our restaurants to be remodeled and have that sort of be big reinvestment cycle behind us, that's a huge positive. I think the fact that we're seeing now 2019 was a record cash flow year for franchisees, 2020 is a record cash flow year for franchisees and 2021 will be a record cash flow year for franchisees. I think that ability to have just franchisees with the firepower is something that we've seen in our European markets and then you're starting - we're starting to see the brand in the US really improve and move and that has been through a lot of the hard work the Joe and the team have done along with how our franchisees bring the brand to life every day in the restaurant, and I think when you see a stronger improving brand performance, that was the hallmark of our success in Europe and we're seeing that now starting to gain some traction in the US. So, certainly we're optimistic and hopeful that what we saw that playbook in Europe will translate over in the US and we've got a few years of momentum under our belt that gives us confidence in that. Joe, I don't know if you have anything else to add.\nJoe Erlinger: I think you've captured it incredibly well that certainly was my experience overseas, when you make those right investments and then you will continually tap into them whether it be that the strength of your modern or whether it'd be that the digital experience or whether it'd be your improvements in menu, these things all work in combination together a consensual that multi-year run.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Question on loyalty, could you give us a sense of how much you think loyalty will impact McDonald's globally and in the US just France and the US piloting show incrementality to sales and not just the visit tenant like you mentioned, I think Joe mentioned that and what changes to technology or otherwise can help ensure that loyalty can work with the drive-thru you've made some strides there, but you don't want customers fumbling per scan codes and it sounds like from Joe's comments that you're closer than we thought on customer identification. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: There's no question that the results out of our tests in New England and Phoenix have been incredibly positive the operators in those markets loved what loyalty is doing our customers love what loyalty is doing and I think our restaurant teams have really taken to it as well. We're very confident in the business case and we think about the impact that this could have on the US business, where 85%+ of the US population actually comes to McDonald's at least one time a year. And so if loyalty can build frequency given the base that we have of customers in the US. This is just a tremendous unlock for us relative to the operations operational impact there, it is having a modest impact in our drive thru's, we've trained our people really well, the training, it's actually happening, it's really around the customer side, and it's the order taking time to slightly up, but we will be seeing benefits in the cash taking time as a result of this as we come more digitally penetrated system. I think that the momentum in the system is going to build in the coming months as we set up for our launch later this summer. Dave, I would just add, we wouldn't be doing this globally, if we didn't think there was going to be an incremental benefit to loyalty, we're not at this point quantifying that, but certainly our thesis is that there is going to be an incremental benefit that we get out of loyalty about the identification at the drive through quarter point, we're not there yet, but I think it's safe to say that we've got a number of ideas on how we're going to be able to make that happen and that's part of our rollout plan over the next couple of years. So, I think you can safely expect that we're going to get a solution, it may not be the same solution everywhere, but we'll have solutions in place that allow us to get faster at identifying the customer at the order point, Kevin, what are you going to say.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'd add is we have been working on our kind of underlying tech stack around the world over the last couple of years. So, one of the things that that facilitates is at the same time we're piloting this loyalty program in the US here we're also piloting in Germany also and we intend to roll out the loyalty program in Germany and Canada by the end of this year also. That's an addition to some countries that already have a loyalty program like France in China for example.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I have to talk about the technology investments you've mentioned working on the underlying tech stack. I guess the question is kind of two parts, one is, can you maybe some color on your market share gains in the US, just to validate the view that it's not just the environment that's helping you, it's even initiatives you're undertaking. So, anything you can say about you versus competitors and different dayparts and then without obviously disclosing anything competitive, maybe you could talk a bit more detail about the evidence you're seeing that the investments are paying off and maybe tie those digital initiatives back to the G&A spend, not the incentive comp, of course, this year, but. And just the sort of elevated G&A spend as a percentage of sales and certainly the dollars you're spending are substantially bigger than what anybody else in the industry could stand, so just any color you can give that kind of credit offers credibility to the idea, this is sort of the right amount of investment and allowing you to lead competitors. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Joe, why don't you cover the market share gains and what we're seeing in the US and then Kevin, you can talk about just our investment levels there and how we think about that.\nJoe Erlinger: Yes. Relative to market share, especially on traffic. It's proven very challenging to read exactly what's going on within the industry, because you're seeing shifts of all kind, there was still early in the pandemic, the shift away from the breakfast daypart in toward the dinner daypart. You've also seen obviously, a substantial increase in average check as you have more people per transaction or actually eating off of that off of that transaction. We feel very good about our competitive position and where we are relative to our, our key competitors. And when we look at our own two-year comp stack and the fact that we're putting up the kind of growth numbers, we are up versus 2019. We feel good about our position. And I'll let Kevin talk specifically about some of the tech investments. But when you think about your McDonald's USA having digital sales of 1.5 - almost 1.5 billion in the first quarter and the fact we've got 20 billion active app users. I think we feel really good about the way we've set up in the US ourselves to really benefit from these investments and to make these multi-year gains, I've talked about.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I guess the only thing I'd add, we certainly benchmark our tech spend against peers looking at how much we spend as a percent of revenue, et cetera and generally are favorable, and a lot of those types of metrics. But as Joe talked about and the way we think about it is, you're not going to directly relate every years of tax spend to that year's specific sales of some of the investments we've made over the last couple of years are facilitating us being able to go put in loyalty in the US right now and being able to do it in Germany at the same time and being able to roll it out in several markets' kind of simultaneously or in a similar timeframe. So, part of the kind of catch-up that we needed to do over the last couple of years, was to get a common tech stack across our globe so that now we're able to move at a quicker pace as we have new things like loyalty and deploy them in several markets and a relatively shorter timeframe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you and good morning. Appreciate the color around the franchise partners especially domestically and what they're doing to put the brand to work. Could you give us an update on the profile, you know the tenure in the system, number of stores. I haven't asked for a while around first, second, third generation, and I'm just curious how anything in the past year has shaped the natural passing of these legacy systems. And then the second part is, on the survey results, I wasn't clear if that was headquarter kind of survey or field survey. If you could clarify that. And what was most validating and most surprising. Thank you.\nJoe Erlinger: Thanks, Nicole for the question. Relative to the franchise profile. It hasn't dramatically changed in the last year or two. Several years back, though, we did begin to make a move towards having fewer and larger franchisees and that trend roughly continues, but not nearly at the pace that it was happening three to five years ago, there is a substantial number of second and our third-generation franchisees as I've returned to the US business, 18 months ago. I really have been struck by the number of second and third generation franchisees that do now exist within the McDonald's system. Obviously, it's a hallmark of our brand and what we've been in the past. I'll let Chris answer that.\nChris Kempczinski: And the survey result. So, that was a global survey of all company employees. So, we had, I forget how many people actually reply. But we had - we were really pleased with the take-up rate on that and that again was global, I think things that we were most pleased about the overall optimism that exists around the world for our business outlook was certainly something that was a positive for us. The second is, we were - we went in and we had individual questions about our performance against each of the five values that I outlined. We saw very strong performance both in absolute, but also a year-over-year growth in those as well. So I was positive on that I think the opportunity for us that I've talked about and that we're working on is doing more to create a culture where people feel comfortable challenging debating speaking up, we have opportunities there and that's from a culture standpoint, something that my senior leadership team and I are working on.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. I want to go back to the IOM segment. I realize that you are still not to pre-COVID sales levels yet, but as markets do successfully wrestle COVID. I think we have enough evidence at this point to believe. It's just a matter of when not if, as it relates to more than a full sales recovery in IOM segment. And yet 1700 company-own units there. So, what I would like to understand is, how is the company on margins in that segment positioned to perform, as you inevitably do get to above these 2019 sales levels. I know you just had not to expected this year as far as a recapture, but perhaps you can share some insights from what you're seeing at the UK or Canada where the trend is already above 19?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, Brian. I'll take that question. Yes, one of the things I think I talked about in my script was that while we are below historical levels, as you said, that is really a result of certain markets not being - not having the sales levels back to pre-COVID to your point. The markets that are at pre-COVID levels and have been able to continue growing sales are able to continue growing margin similar to how they were pre-COVID. So, to us it is a - I'll say a matter of time to a certain extent, we expect as restrictions ease, as curfews go away and we're able to reopen dining rooms, those are the biggest things that need to happen, specifically in a few of our large markets like France and Germany for example. But there isn't anything structural that is preventing us from getting back to our historical levels of company operated margins in those and we are experiencing those types of margins in the markets that have already gotten back to those sales levels.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Carroll with RBC.\nChris Carril: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Joe, you mentioned that US comps were double-digit positive across all dayparts. But I was curious specifically about the morning daypart and how that trended through the quarter, and specifically what breakfast trends look like acquired to the lap of last year's declines and perhaps what you're seeing more recently. And then looking ahead, how are you thinking about how you can build on breakfast share gains that you've noted recently?\nJoe Erlinger: Sure, thanks Chris for the question. We turned to positive in the breakfast daypart back in the third quarter, I believe and since then, we've been positive. So it wasn't all a lap of the above the pandemic negatives at the breakfast daypart. And obviously part of that is because of our historical strength in this daypart. Part of that is because the importance of drive-thru speed especially at breakfast is important and part of that is some of the menu item moves we've made around offering McCafe Bakery, I think I've also set us up well for the breakfast daypart. We're acutely focused on this daypart because we believe that certainly as some consumer habits return to pre-pandemic ways of life that breakfast daypart will continue to come back and similar to the way that it was a real market share gain - market share battle pre-pandemic, we think that market share battle will absolutely continue and we're ready and prepared for that.\nOperator: Next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. The comment was made on Australia, in terms of maintaining average ticket even, it sounds like with traffic coming back in. I was wondering if that could be applied to the US as well. In other words when traffic recovery, I guess at this point is an inevitability. Can you maintain that average ticket which I think has been the primary driver of comps over the past 12 months is the first question. And second, I think related to that - is related to that, what's different about the Chicken Sandwich this time, obviously we've seen over the last 20 years, a number of different core and premium your Chicken Sandwich Strips, what have you, that have kind of come and gone from the McDonald's menu, what gives you the confidence this time that it becomes not only something that you can sustain that you can grow upon. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, John. I think on the ticket, we have seen in a number of markets that have been able to kind of weather the pandemic, Australia been one that has done particularly well through that, but Japan another one that ticket levels do stay elevated, I think a big function of this becomes to what degree does the channel mix revert back to what we saw pre-pandemic or stay elevated, so to degree that you see delivery remain an elevated part of the ticket to the degree that you see drive-thru continue to outperform those are going to have a positive impact on ticket and it's somewhat negative impact on traffic, just because of the bundled nature of those channels. So, I think it's difficult to say broadly, how that's going to play out, but we are seeing overall that some of the changes that happen with consumers through this pandemic like doing more delivery like going through drive-thru that those we expect are going to be enduring, so I think it's probably fair to say that ticket is going to be a driver for us coming out of the pandemic. Joe, why don't that you talk about the Chicken Sandwich in the US.\nJoe Erlinger: Yes, I feel very confident about this Chicken Sandwich I know and I actually acknowledge, John, that we've had many in's and out's chicken sandwiches over the years, but I think we did our research we really grounded ourselves in the consumer on this one at a very significant way. I also think that we've done a good job of tapping more significantly into trends with our spicy offering as part of the chicken line and I think you're increasing focus on multi-cultural use also is contributing to our success here. Whenever you launch a product at McDonald's you launch and then you have a decay curve and I feel very confident about this because the decay curve on our Chicken Sandwich is dramatically different than what we've seen in past years. We're two months past the initial launch of late February, and we still feel really good about the volume and movement that we're seeing.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I would just add on that that Joe has talked about in the past and I completely agree is when we think about chicken. It's a holistic strategy, so it's not just going to be predicated on one sandwich, we've got a very strong nuggets platform, we have McChicken and so one of the things that Joe and the team did, I think we're really well in the US is leveraging the other aspects of our chicken portfolio, we had nuggets that ran in front of the Chicken Sandwich launch and using sort of everything in our arsenal there to drive Chicken, as it's going to be one of the things that I think is different this time. I think the other is a very good alignment that Joe and the team have been able to drive with our franchisees on sustained support for this. This is not sort of one of those put a bunch of media weight against it for a quarter, and then move onto the next thing, I think there is broad understanding in alignment that this has to be supported over a longer period of time. And so, certainly from my vantage point. Those are two things that give me confidence about what we're seeing in the US.\nOperator: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thanks. So, just on the global partnership of the BTS your third famous [indiscernible] can you share if and how these partnerships are helping you reach and engage with a new audience. And then, just broadly speaking, how your social media strategy has evolved over the last 18 months or so.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, so I think one of the things that we were delighted to see with our first Famous order and Travis Scott was just the huge digital uptake that drove on the business. Joe might know the exact number of downloads that we saw in the US, but I mean it was a phenomenal driver of digital engagement for us in the platform and going forward I think for us that's continuing to use Famous Orders as a way to drive digital engagement, the consumer that it was drawn to these sorts of celebrities is inherently a digital first consumer and so it's natural that they're going to want to interface and interact with our brand in a digital first manner. So, that going forward it is going to be a key part of our strategy. And on social media, I think you've seen - we have gotten I think a little bit more nimble and consumer-centric in our social media approach it doesn't read any more like a corporate website. that's being populated maybe by the CEO, it's actually being written by people with the sense of humor and that - fun to, so listen to which is what our brand is about, I mean our brand is meant to be an engaging, fun, useful brand and so having voices that are running our social media campaign on a day-to-day basis, I think you're seeing the benefit of that. And I think for us it's about making sure though that we also do it in a way that feels authentic to McDonald's. I think some of the others out there maybe like to hear a little bit more into the snarky territory, we try to be a brand that leads with a really positive message and is one focused on McDonald's and we're seeing great engagement from that. So, I appreciate you mentioning that and I promise I will stay off social media with the corporate website.\nJoe Erlinger: If I could just add one thing on the digital consumer, the US business has never had a significant challenge of attracting a digital consumer, our challenge has been around retaining them. And I think that we have been much more purposeful in all of our retention and lifecycle management efforts, actually leading up to the Travis Scott meal initially because we knew that there would be a big surge in interest digitally around McDonald's because of that, and those retention efforts have really borne significant fruit and we've utilized those same retention efforts for our holiday promotions as well as for J Balvin and we'll be doing the same as BTS comes here. And then naturally as we, as we flow into loyalty, we will naturally have a greater opportunity for retention via my McDonald's rewards.\nMike Cieplak: We're at the bottom of the hour.

When we gathered at this time last year, we expected 2022 to be a year of recovery from the pandemic, particularly in Europe. Little did we know there would be another challenging year and nobody could have predicted the extent to which the war in Europe would disrupt businesses around the world and the macroeconomic impact that would follow. Despite continued volatility in nearly every corner of the globe, McDonald\u2019s delivered exceptional growth throughout 2022. We achieved full year comp sales growth of 10.9%, delivered strong guest count performance with 5% growth globally, and saw our momentum strengthen as the year progressed with double-digit comp sales growth across all segments in Q4. These results are a testament to the resilience of the McDonald\u2019s system and demonstrate that our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which we unveiled in the early days of the pandemic, is working. This strategy is anchored by three growth pillars also known as our M, C, and D\u2019s, maximize our marketing, commit to the core menu, and double down on the 3Ds.  Our 2022 performance demonstrated that continued potential of each growth pillar. You've heard me say McDonald's is one of the world's greatest brands. In the last year, we've unlocked even more ways to elevate our marketing through creative excellence. Our scalable insights are helping us tap into our fans love for McDonald's and create culturally relevant campaigns that resonate across markets and drive growth. That momentum continued into Q4. In October, our collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market in the U.S. brought together our adult fans love and nostalgia for the Happy Meal with one of the most on trend brands and culture. Customer excitement was palpable and it's fair to say the program exceeded expectations. This program drove the highest weekly digital transactions ever seen in the U.S.  To celebrate the FIFA World Cup, we launched our largest global marketing campaign ever with more than 75 markets participating worldwide. Want to go to McDonald's? Brought to life yet another fan truth, whatever the culture or language and whatever the outcome of the game, we can all unite under the Golden Arches. Our aim was to support fans that were watching the FIFA World Cup at home through relevant and meaningful McDelivery promotions, regardless of the time zone that their team was playing in. During this campaign, we saw double-digit increases in delivery sales across our top 10 markets.  And just a couple of weeks ago, the UK launched their Raise Your Arches campaign, which has generated significant excitement with our customers. Even though the campaign never shows our food, never shows our restaurant, and never mentioned our brand name, it's nonetheless instantly recognizable as only McDonald's. Imagine that, a brand so powerful, it requires no introduction. The campaign has been quickly picked up by over 30 other markets, demonstrating our systems\u2019 ability to quickly scale compelling ideas across the globe.  Throughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items they love. The strength of our brand goes beyond the Golden Arches themselves and includes our iconic products such as our world famous French Fries, the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets and the McFlurry. Each of these products are billion-dollar brands and in total, McDonald's possesses 10 of these billion-dollar brand equities. In an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. Throughout the year, we continue to step up our game on the favorites that build our heritage. We're delivering hotter, juicier, more delicious burgers and building on the success of emerging equities like the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich. As a result, we are gaining market share in both chicken and beef. When customers want to enjoy our classic favorites, they are increasingly looking for even more personalized and convenient ways to get their meals. Through our focus on digital, we are transforming from a brand that serve billions and billions all the same way to one that serves each of our billions of customers uniquely as individuals with customized products, offers, and experiences. By doing this, we strengthen our customers love and loyalty for McDonald's. These investments are paying off. In the fourth quarter, digital represented over 35% of system-wide sales in our top six markets.  In 2022, the McDonald's App was downloaded over 40 million times in the U.S., greater than the total downloads of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th brands combined. Through our loyalty program, which we've expanded over 50 markets and counting, customers are feeling more connected to McDonald's, which in turn increases visits and frequency. As we closed the year, we had almost 50 million active loyalty users in our top six markets. The success of Accelerating the Arches has put McDonald's in an advantage position. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown system-wide sales nearly $20 billion despite closing over 800 restaurants in Russia. Our brand is clearly in the strongest position it's been in years, attributable in part to our best-in-class marketing engine. And service times and customer satisfaction are both improving, a testament to the dedication of our restaurant teams. Our success is fueling even greater ambitions. While we feel good about our strategy and the growth potential in each of our M-C-D pillars, we've been asking ourselves two questions, is there anything we should add to Accelerating the Arches? And is there anything that could get in the way of the success of Accelerating the Arches? The answers to these two questions led us to evolve our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which we announced a few weeks ago. We'll continue to double down our M-C-D's while adding a fourth D, restaurant development to our 3D's growth pillar. Our strong comp and brand performance has given us the right to build new units at a faster rate than we have historically.  We also announced accelerating the organization, an effort to modernize the way we work, so that we're faster, more innovative, and more efficient. Work is now underway to further build out these initiatives and quantify their contribution to our long-term financial algorithm. We'll share more details with all of you at an investor update in Chicago sometime in late 2023. To expand further on how Accelerating the Arches drove success in 2022, I'll now turn it over to Ian.\nIan F. Borden: Thanks, Chris. By putting our customers at the center of Accelerating the Arches, we're driving top line momentum and broad-based global strength for our brand. Global comparable sales were up double digits for the fourth quarter, and we continue to gain share across most of our major markets. Our performance is a direct result of executing against our strategy, making it clear that we're operating from a position of strength and proving once again that our business remains resilient despite the dynamic macro environment.  In our international operated markets, we leveraged our digital channels and highlighted our core menu delivering comp sales growth of nearly 13% for the quarter. As our big five international operated markets continued to recover from COVID throughout the year, we consistently created delicious feel good moments for our customers, achieving strong performance across each of these markets. The UK continued their focus on chicken with an early fourth quarter launch of the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich. This emerging global equity builds on iconic core favorites like Chicken McNuggets and drove a meaningful lift to the chicken category. The UK market also leaned into the power of our brand with the popular Reindeer Ready holiday campaign returning for the sixth consecutive year. The fourth quarter also brought the return of McDonald's monopoly to the Canadian market, but this time utilizing our app to elevate the experience. We leveraged learnings from recent UK and Australia activations, where we combine the nostalgic peel off game pieces with the option to digitally scan and track progress on our app, which helped accelerate top line momentum and sales through our digital channels.  Fueling digital growth was also central to Germany's strong performance with the market's first My McDonald's branded affordability campaign. This promotion featured daily offers alongside mobile order messaging to drive full digital platform engagement. It was followed by the launch of Digital Monopoly in the market, which helped grow digital to over 60% of total sales. It's examples like this that once again highlight the power of the McDonald's system, allowing us to tap into proven successes in one market and then scale those ideas.  In Australia, we continued to leverage the strength of our McCaf\u00e9 brand with an iced coffee promotion in the summer months. This campaign built upon our coffee leadership in the market as we continue to drive share gains. And we maintained our market leadership in France with always on family messaging and a fully integrated chicken campaign highlighting our iconic chicken McNuggets paired with unique and trendy sauces.  Moving to the U.S., comp sales were up over 10% for the quarter, a testament to our work together with franchisees over the last several years, which has created a strong foundation. The collective decisions to put brand at the center of our marketing, along with simplifying our menus, strengthening our digital business, and recommitting to our core have resonated with consumers and are continuing to drive growth. Strategic calendar planning from marketing to restaurant execution has enabled our teams to stay laser focused on what truly matters most for our customers. Higher average check supported by strategic price increases as well as positive guest counts, contributed to our performance this quarter. Memorable marketing campaigns, including our collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market, Blue Buckets, and McRib brought nostalgia to our customers fueling top line momentum with limited added complexity in our restaurants.  Turning to our international developmental license markets, comp sales were up over 16% for the quarter, with strong sales growth across all geographies in the segment. Japan achieved an impressive 29th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales with continued strength at the dinner day part. A focus on driving digital affordability helped increase the frequency of our most loyal digital customers. Recovery in China, however, remain challenging as COVID related government restrictions were still in place for a majority of the fourth quarter, resulting in some temporary closures and limited operations. While comp sales in China were negative, we focused on showcasing our strength in beef with the Big Mac Best Burger launch and continued to gain traffic share in a shrinking QSR market. And despite the ongoing operating challenges, we opened over 700 new restaurants last year, which is an all-time high.  Turning to our P&L, company operated margins were just over 15% for the quarter, reflecting the continued pressure from elevated commodities, wages, as well as higher energy costs. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.16 per share, with earnings per share of $2.59 for the quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was nearly 45%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments. Despite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed, top line results generated restaurant margin dollars of over 13 billion for the year, an increase of nearly 1.5 billion in constant currency. Franchise restaurants, which now represent 95% of our global portfolio, contributed nearly 90% of our total restaurant margins, reflecting the stability of our business model.  Lastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CAPEX spend for the year was approximately 1.9 billion, which included remaining reinvestment to substantially complete our experience of the future efforts in the U.S. market. Over the last few years, we've invested billions of dollars in modernizing our estate, and it's clear in our results that these investments are paying off. After reinvesting in the business, our free cash flow conversion was nearly 90% for the year. And with that, let me pass it back over to Chris. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. As we look ahead to 2023, macroeconomic uncertainties will persist and we expect to continue to face headwinds. Our base case for a mild to moderate recession in the U.S. and one that will be a little deeper and longer in Europe is unchanged from what we shared on our Q3 earnings call. We also expect inflationary costs to continue to pressure our margins, which Ian will discuss in greater detail. In this environment, we must maintain our disciplined approach to pricing. We need to balance passing through our pricing on our menus while maintaining our strong position on value with our customers. Our positive guest count performance in 2022 demonstrates our success so far in balancing these competing demands, and we need to remain judicious with pricing actions.  Ongoing communication with our franchisees regarding the magnitude and pace of pricing will remain essential. Our franchisees are focused on the long term and time and again that approach has been rewarded. As long as we continue to do the right things for the customer, we can always work through short term challenges. McDonald's understands that customer\u2019s perception on value is made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience we provide. Our modernization efforts have had a significant impact on improving our customers experience, and this is also improving how our customers think of our brand. Now that we are nearly fully modernized, our attention is turned to being laser focused on our operations and running great restaurants. In 2022, we reengaged most of our system on maintaining operational excellence in our restaurants through our Performance and Customer Excellence program, also known as PACE. This restaurant assessment and consulting tool, which is currently deployed in 30 markets, was suspended during COVID. Along with providing new tools, this represents a new way of working for our field teams that help us market target organizational and restaurant support for key growth drivers. This renewed focus will help protect McDonald's brand standards for an outstanding customer experience every single day.  Restarting PACE in 2022 led to strong operational improvements in several key markets as a result of a more dedicated consulting and coaching time to support lower performing restaurants. For example, the UK saw improved customer satisfaction, speed of service, and overall experience for these restaurants. In Spain, restaurants that had the lowest customer satisfaction scores in the drive-thru improved to be at the same level as top-performing restaurants by the end of 2022. Additionally, as a result of this program, France saw increases of 30% in customer satisfaction scores at locations with the lowest scores. PACE clearly drives operational improvements, which provides a better customer experience that in turn drives business performance. This month, the U.S. also restarted PACE, and we expect to see similar operational benefits in our largest market in 2023. I'll now turn it back to Ian to talk in more detail about our 2023 outlook.\nIan F. Borden: As Chris just discussed and as I talked about last quarter, we continue to operate in an extremely dynamic environment. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate macro-related pressures will continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business. With significant inflationary headwinds across commodities, labor and utilities, our company-operated margin percent will be hampered in the near term, and we expect full year 2023 company-operated margin percent will be slightly lower than our quarter four results. This elevated cost environment is also impacting restaurant cash flow for our franchisees, particularly in our European markets. As we've previously mentioned, our financial strength and scale gives us the ability to provide temporary and targeted support, ultimately keeping our entire system aligned on proactively investing to drive long-term growth. We estimate that these efforts will have an impact of between $100 million to $150 million in 2023. Turning to G&A, the digital and technology investments that we've made over the past few years have been strong contributors to our top line growth. Moving forward, focusing on our evolution of Accelerating the Arches, and in particular accelerating the organization, will enable us to work more efficiently and effectively, harnessing our scale and reallocating resources to drive growth in the future. In 2023, we expect G&A to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of system wide sales. Despite the cost pressures throughout the P&L in 2023, we anticipate an operating margin of about 45% driven primarily by strong top line growth and franchise margin performance.  We're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 10% and 12% compared to 2022 primarily due to higher average rates on our debt balances. And we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%. We anticipate currency translation will negatively impact earnings per share of between $0.07 and $0.09 in the first quarter. As of now, we expect currency translation to be a slight tailwind for the full year but as you have seen, currency rates have been fluctuating quite a bit recently. So we'll continue to keep you posted on the anticipated impact to our results. Transitioning to capital expenditures, we plan to spend between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion this year, about half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings. Globally, we plan to open about 1,900 restaurants with more than 400 of these openings in our U.S. and IOM segments, where we continue to see strong returns. The remaining 1,500-or-so new restaurants, including about 900 in China, will be across our IDL markets. As a reminder, our strategic partners provide the capital for these restaurant openings. Overall, we anticipate almost 4% unit growth from about 1,500 net restaurant additions in 2023. We expect this will contribute along with restaurants opened in 2022, nearly 1.5% to system-wide sales growth.  As Chris mentioned, work is underway on our fourth D, restaurant development, within Accelerating the Arches. We'll have more details to share later this year, but we're excited about the opportunity to accelerate the pace of our new unit openings moving forward. And finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2023, enabling us once again to convert more than 90% of our net income to free cash flow. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to invest in new units and opportunities to grow the business along with reinvesting in existing restaurants; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to repurchase shares. It's times like these that highlight the strength and scale of our McDonald's system. Although 2023 will bring short-term pressures, I'm confident that the resilience of our business and our strategy will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\nChristopher J. Kempczinski: The McDonald's global system is executing at a high level, and I'm optimistic that our Accelerating the Arches strategy offers us a long runway of growth despite the headwinds that we've discussed on this call. The McDonald's brand is in great shape, and yet there's so much more we can do. In my travels throughout our global system, I sometimes like to ask our people, what exactly does McDonald's Corporation sell? As you might imagine, this usually prompts a lot of puzzled looks, and a brave soul or two will raise their hand and say, \"Well, we sell great-tasting food or we sell burgers and fries.\" Of course, that's technically true. But as a largely franchised business, ultimately, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand so that others can sell burgers and fries. And while some may see it as a trivial distinction, I see it as fundamental. As goes the McDonald's brand, so goes the health and economic value of our company and system. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is designed to build our brand to make McDonald's more relevant to more people more often. Our M-C-D growth pillars are driving system-wide sales, and the recently announced Accelerating the Organization initiative will help us unlock further growth by enabling our system to be even faster, more innovative, and more efficient. Through Accelerating the Organization, we'll sharpen our priorities and increase our investments against our biggest opportunities. I want to congratulate the McDonald's system on a terrific 2022 and thank all three legs of the stool, our franchisees, our suppliers, and our company employees for their dedication and passion for our business. A global pandemic, record-breaking inflation, a war in Europe, the McDonald's system continues to execute and deliver no matter the challenge, and I'm excited to continue our success into 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. \nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you. A big-picture question tied into some of the stuff you were talking about in the U.S. It's been fascinating to see how McDonald's traffic in the U.S. has largely declined, most years at least, even as you've added about $1 million in sales per unit. And your customer satisfaction scores and the external stuff that we see, it's been stubbornly and surprisingly low. It's almost like the consumers being more honest with his or her spending rather than these surveys. So I'm wondering, in your work, where do you see the customer satisfaction opportunity in the U.S., whether that's in convenience and speed or food or other? And do you think the U.S. will have a different same-store traffic outcome over the next year or decade based on some of the stuff that you're doing? Thank you. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: David, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Well, I think starting with -- we've talked about on a number of calls over the last several years that guest count is a very imprecise measure, and it's imprecise because of what we've seen with delivery, but also what we've seen with digital, where we're now getting multiple orders. And so while it's important for us to always be attentive to guest count, I think also recognize that the complexion of how customers are experiencing the restaurant has changed. So from that vantage point, we look at things from a relative perspective and we feel very good about our relative performance on that as evidenced by our strong traffic growth that we had in the U.S. this year. I think your larger question about the health of the brand, there are lots of different surveys. Ultimately for us, we have our own internal surveys and customer satisfaction with McDonald's is strong. I think our brand clearly is resonating as you've seen in our marketing communication, the fact that we have a modernized restaurant estate, I think, has been huge for us in terms of improving customer perception of the brand. And so I feel very good about that. But for us, going forward, the opportunity for us to continue to make our brands more and more beloved is going to be on this digital opportunity. And as I mentioned in the opening comments there, digital gives us such an unlock to get more tailored in the experience, the offer, the products that we're delivering to our customers.  So I think for us, if we can get there on digital, that's going to be a big opportunity. And we've made a lot of progress. As you heard in the opening comments, about 35%, I think it's 36% in Q4, were digital transactions. And by the way, half of those digital transactions are known digital transactions, where we know the customer. Imagine if that number -- I'll just use as one outlier, close to 90% of our transactions in China are digital transactions. And imagine if most of those are known transactions, you can start to imagine what that can mean for the brand in the long-term. So I'm optimistic about where we're at.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I had a question about the investments you're making in the franchisee system. I think, Ian, you mentioned it was $100 million to $150 million for this year. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on why that was necessary given the strength you're seeing in the top line or the franchisees presumably are seeing in the top line and also some signs that maybe the cost environment has not been as bad as feared? And then maybe as part of that question, if you could just comment on where franchisee-level cash flows are today versus maybe where they were a year ago, that would be helpful? Thanks. \nIan F. Borden: Great. Good morning David. Thanks for the question. Well, I think as you've heard us and particularly me speak to, I think, particularly in Europe, we're seeing some quite strong headwinds due to the levels of inflation on things like commodity costs, energy prices and, of course, labor. And I think the pace and scale of inflation mean that those headwinds are creating relatively significant levels of short-term impact to our margins and then, of course, to our franchisee cash flows. And I think one of the competitive advantages that we have as a global franchisor with our size, our scale, and our brand strength is that we're able to provide that temporary and targeted support for our franchisees, which we always, of course, direct to where it's most needed.  I mean I would use the UK as a bit of an example and Europe. I mean, I think -- obviously, we've seen significant levels of food inflation, significant levels of energy inflation, even though energy maybe hasn't gotten to the peak of where some were predicting because Europe's had a warm or milder winter so far. I mean still significantly above where it was 12 to 18 months ago. And I think, again, just the pace and scale of that impact is creating quite a bit of pressure on margins and cash flow, as I said. And our size and scale, as I said, just allows us -- puts us in a position to provide that support, direct it to where it's most needed. I think, honestly, that's nothing new for McDonald's. I mean it occurs from time to time around the world when conditions warrant. It's just a little bit more significant now just due to the broader nature and scale of some of those short-term impacts that we're seeing. And if you remember, during COVID, we did provide support to our system. It was critically important because it allowed all of our systems to stay focused on our plans and was really fundamental to the accelerated momentum that we saw through and then coming out of the pandemic. This is a very similar situation. I mean our system is highly aligned, it's confident, and it's focused on our strategic plans and is continuing to proactively invest against the opportunity areas that we have. So I think it's this that's really going to help us stay focused on the category-leading momentum we have and make sure that we -- as we get out of these headwinds, we're in the strongest possible position.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for the question. Maybe if I can ask one about unit growth, if I can. I'm not sure you already finished 2022 on a gross basis. But I'm guessing based on the year-end CAPEX number that it was maybe slightly below your expectations. And then this year, you're expecting development to be a bigger focus and an uptick in unit openings to about 1,900. So maybe if you can comment on where you're starting to see maybe some improvement in the construction and permit timing and also what you're seeing in terms of build-out costs, perhaps directionally new unit economics given those higher costs and presumably the lower margins that you're signaling with your guidance? Thanks. \nIan F. Borden: Good morning, Eric. Yes, thanks for that. I think for sure, in 2022, we had some impact just from that -- coming out of COVID, some of the impacts on just getting permits approved. I mean, as you've heard us talk about in our outlook for 2023, we think we're going to open on a gross basis about 1,900 locations, about 1,500 on a net basis. If you look specifically at the U.S. and IOM segments, we're planning about 400 openings there. That's up about 25% from where we landed on in 2022. So I think that's a sign of the confidence we have and the opportunity that we've got in those segments to begin to start accelerating openings as we've talked about adding that 4D development. For sure, I think there's certainly some inflation on the construction and development costs like we're seeing across almost every sector today. But we also know we've got opportunity, I think, to be more efficient and effective in our investments that we're making in some of the restaurant formats and how we can get more efficient and effective as we bring those formats up. And so feel really good about the returns that we're continuing to generate, particularly in the U.S. and our IOM segments, and feel confident in the opportunity we've got to add more units as we go forward.\nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Yes. I would just add a couple of things. I mean think about the U.S. for a moment. We haven't added new units in the U.S. in eight years. I mean 2014 was the last year that we actually grew restaurants in the U.S. So we've had eight years where we have been focused largely on a remodel program. And in that same period of time, I think everybody would agree, our U.S. business is in a significantly better shape today than it was back then. And so you look at our three-year stack, our three-year stack in the U.S. is 25%. Our global three-year stack is also around 25%. We've grown the business to a great degree and what we haven't done is we haven't kept up with the new unit pace, particularly in our owned markets, U.S. and IOM. And so we're spending the time right now to get a very granular look at where we would build, at what pace, and what types of restaurants, and that's the -- what we plan on sharing with you at the end of 2023.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the U.S. and Europe. Clearly strong double-digit comp performance. I'm just wondering as you kind of look beneath the top line, any sign of slowing macro impact in the consumer or perhaps any concern of consumer pushback on the outsized menu pricing or maybe just looking more broadly, any color on McDonald's versus the industry in terms of market share in key markets since we know everyone is being more aggressive on price, any kind of color you could provide would be great? Thank you. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: I think overall, we're still seeing the consumer is resilient, and it plays to our strengths as a system in terms of being well positioned on value. We lead in every market around the world on affordability and value for money. And so that puts McDonald's in a strong position. We've talked about on prior calls, there is a little bit of a decrease in units per transaction that we're seeing. We're seeing a little bit of trade-down. But I got to say, these are probably on the margin that we're seeing this. Overall, the consumer, whether it's in Europe or the U.S., is actually holding up better than what we would have probably expected or maybe what I would have expected a year ago or six months ago. So I think the question is as we go into 2023, there is going to continue to be inflation. The environment is going to continue to be challenging, I think, from a macro standpoint. And so do you reach a point where maybe it does start to materialize around the consumer. Certainly, consumer sentiment out there remains depressed in many markets. But we're not seeing it right now. I think it goes back to what I said in the opening though, we have to be very judicious. And our franchisees have been great about the pace of pricing, where we're just making sure that we're keeping the customer engaged and coming into our restaurants as we're working through the menu pricing. And we're today still seeing flow through on pricing in line with our historical numbers. So not seeing any big resistance right now.\nIan F. Borden: Maybe I'll just hook on to that a little bit because I think as Chris touched on, I mean, we're laser-focused on those two consumer-facing metrics and value for money and making sure we've got those affordable choices across our menu. And I think, as Chris said, we're in a leadership position across the majority of our top markets in both of those metrics. And we know that even though those metrics have probably come down a little bit over the last 12 months or so on the back of higher pricing, the gap to the competitive set that we have has remained consistent. And so as Chris talked about, I think we've had a good discipline around pricing and making sure we keep that strong value for money in place. I think the other thing that's important to highlight is we know that we're continuing to gain share across all of those key markets. And so another kind of proof point of, I think, how we're navigating and continue to resonate with consumers. I mean, I think at the end of the day, value for money is about the experience we deliver over the price we charge. And I think it goes back to what Chris touched on earlier that we've made a lot of investments over the last couple of years in the experience. We've got a fully modernized estate. I think we've upped our game in terms of our marketing, creativity, and execution. We've invested a lot in our digital capabilities and interaction with consumers. And I think all of those strengths are coming together now. And I think our focus as we head into 2023 is really on making sure that each and every time consumers choose to come into one of our restaurants, we deliver them a great experience and continue to ensure that we earn those visits each and every time.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes, thank you, good morning. Maybe I'll just ask about the kind of 45% operating margin outlook for the year and the components of that. Do you think that as a result of kind of the Accelerating the Organization strategy that there will be some savings in G&A over time or is this just perhaps a reallocation, would you expect to continue to see some leverage on the franchise margin side, for example, I guess I'm just trying to think through some of the drivers of that?\nIan F. Borden: Good morning Brian, yes, thanks for the question. Well, let me talk about, I guess, a couple of the pieces. I mean, when you think about operating margin, for sure, there are a couple of specific pressures that we're working through that we believe are short term in nature. Obviously, we've got that pressure on our company-operated margins from the inflationary pressures that we're working through. And so that's an impact. Obviously, we've got the incremental support we're providing to franchisees, which is an impact focused on 2023. So we'll have both of those pressures to work through this year. I think in regards to G&A and ATO, I mean, as you heard in my opening comments, we expect G&A for the year to be between 2.2% and 2.3%. Any kind of outcomes and just a reminder on ATO is it's really focused on our ways of working, which the output is how do we get more efficient, how do we reallocate resource against innovation and growth, and how do we make sure we're moving faster as an organization. So any of the outputs of ATO are kind of included in our 2023 guidance for G&A. I think certainly, the best way to work through any kind of short-term pressures is to continue to make sure we're driving strong top line momentum, which I think our quarter four results reflect, and it's certainly our focus for 2023. And as we get through these short-term pressures, certainly believe that, that strong top line momentum will mean that we're beginning to drive greater leverage and operating margin and anything that's kind of dependent on sales as we go forward like G&A. And so I think we certainly expect to see that beyond 2023.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much. So obviously, very strong U.S. comps. Can you talk about specifically what you saw with traffic and average check in the quarter and performance across dayparts, if there's anything notable there? And then just as it relates to share gains, what are you seeing with the lower-income consumer versus the high-income consumer? Thank you. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Yes. So focusing just on the U.S., I think what we saw from a performance standpoint was very balanced growth across the dayparts. So nothing particularly noteworthy there. Late night for us continues to be the opportunity just because of some changes that we've made around operating hours due to the staffing environment. But around kind of our core dayparts, that's been very strong. We're also seeing strong growth on our core menu, particularly on chicken, where we've been gaining share quite a bit of share on chicken. We've gained about a point of share on chicken in the last year. And then if you think about beef, we're also continuing to grow our share in beef despite having a very strong presence in that already. So nice balanced growth with the U.S. Digital and delivery, of course, are driving outsized growth. So digital, if you look at digital transactions, up close to 40% in the U.S., which is above obviously the 25% -- or the 10%, rather, growth that we saw in Q4. And then on the low-income consumer I'd say the only thing that is probably noteworthy there is while the units per transaction is maybe down slightly, we're seeing a little bit of an uptick in frequency of visits. And so I think that's maybe something where the customer is coming in, being a little bit more cautious about how much they're ordering. They're probably spending to an absolute dollar amount, but we're seeing a little bit of an improvement around frequency with that low-income consumer.\nIan F. Borden: Maybe just I'll hook on a couple of additional kind of pieces of texture. I mean, I think if you look at the full year in the U.S., we were up about 10% from an average pricing standpoint. And as Chris talked about a little bit earlier, a couple of partial offsets to that. One is we continue to kind of see this reversion of order channels more to the kind of pre-COVID behavior. So of course, while delivery is still elevated, it's come back a little bit as customer\u2019s kind of revert to more typical ordering channels. And then as Chris also touched on, you've got that -- maybe that more value-conscious discerning kind of choice making that consumers are making. I think two things that are really important. I mean value for money and affordability, which we've already talked to, we know we're in a really strong leadership position in the U.S. business. And I think the second thing is that on a comp basis, we continue to gain share. And I think those are both strong proof points of the fact that we're well positioned and the fact that we are in a position to ensure that we are affordable and accessible for our consumers despite their individual circumstances as we go forward.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you. Chris, following all the momentum in 2022 and really in recent years, could you talk a bit more about the biggest opportunities that you see as it relates to continuing to drive that guest count momentum in 2023 and perhaps beyond? I don't know if it's the same in the U.S. as key global markets, but just curious how you'd kind of think about or rank order some of the opportunities that you've spoken to on the call? Thank you. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Yes. It really just goes back to the pillars that we have in our strategy. It's marketing for menu and now the 4Ds. I think each of those still has quite a bit of runway of growth. I'm encouraged by what we're doing from a brand standpoint. But there's a lot more we can and will be doing on that to continue to strengthen our brand and marketing excellence. And we're still not as good as we could be around lifting and shifting great ideas around the world and so we're going to get better at that through this Accelerating the Organization effort. On core menu, chicken for us is a big opportunity as is coffee. I think on burgers, we're very well developed. But chicken and coffee, in particular, offer us, I think, a good growth opportunity. And we're going to be focused on that with some very specific products as opposed to having that maybe be something in the past that was a little bit more left to individual markets to kind of chart their course. And then on the 4Ds, I think all of those for us have growth. So it's not a different playbook than what we're talking about with Accelerating the Arches. It's very much the same playbook. And what we're adding into the U.S. this year, as I mentioned in my comments in the opening, is on the operational side. With PACE restarting, I've been very encouraged to see how PACE has been driving customer satisfaction when we put that in, and we're seeing improvement around service time. So you take all of the top line-driving initiatives related to the MCDs and you overlay on top of that improved operations or improved execution at the restaurant, and that gives me confidence in the outlook.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sarah Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to sort of just ask about this -- some of these initiatives in the context maybe of McDonald's history, which is to say, when -- you mentioned, Chris, that it's been since -- 2014 since you had unit growth in the U.S. As I recall, unit growth had picked up a few years before then, but same-store sales slowed. And so there has -- historically, it seems like there's maybe a trade-off there. So that was one sort of piece that I wanted to ask about and how you think about that balance? And then related, Chris, when you joined, there was an initiative, I think, around reducing some of the management layers and really streamlining and making the lines of communication clear between the markets and the headquarters. I guess, what's happened since then or it feels like it's maybe a renewed initiative to do that, so if you could just compare perhaps where you were to what you're doing now and where the reinvestments might be this time versus the last time? Thank you. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Sure. I think on your first point around unit growth versus comp growth, we have to walk and chew gum. It's not one or the other. It's the two of them in combination. And I think the big difference is when you want to be growing units is when you've got strong comp sales because that reflects the underlying health of the business. I'm always very leery when I see someone out there putting a strong unit growth number without strong underlying comp sales because that's historically not been a good recipe in our industry. And so for us, I think we've got, as you've seen in our results, strong comp sales.  I feel very good about the outlook. And so that now gives to me permission to put on top of that some unit growth. But we need to be very smart about where and how we do that. And I think sometimes in the past, we were looking at just putting units and looking at an absolute number and not maybe looking at the quality of the site. And so that's why we want to take some time this year to make sure we feel confident about the exact number, the pacing, the quality of the site so that when we do roll that out that we've got the ability to continue to drive both comp sales as well as unit growth. And then your question about the organization, there's maybe some similarities with differences. I think if you go back to what was done in -- I think it was 2016 or thereabouts, I mean that was savings that largely came about through refranchising a big chunk of our restaurants. And so that was -- as we took McOpCo percentage down and we moved more of that to the franchise side, that gave us some benefits from a G&A standpoint. There were some changes that happened in terms of delayering at the senior level. But what -- that effort was not about is ways of working. That was much more kind of, what I would say, are just business model approaches as opposed to ways of working. And what I've seen in my time in this job and also what I've seen in the U.S. when I was in that role is that we have a lot of opportunities to get faster, more innovative, more efficient. And it's because we have historically been very decentralized in some areas where we reinvent the wheel way too often.  And I think the other thing that we've seen is we haven't been as sharp around our global priorities and so there's been proliferation of priorities that sometimes happen at the market level. I would just give you an example. As we're going through this ATO exercise and learning about where we have the opportunities, we're uncovering all sorts of interesting things, like, for example, one market that has 300 priorities. Well, of course, you can't have 300 priorities, and you can't resource 300 priorities. And so as we discover and learn these things, this is all going to be about making us better. So the difference of today versus what we did maybe back in 2016, I think that was much more of a structural change related to our franchising model with some delayering at the senior level. This is much more fundamental about changing ways of working that I think ultimately are going to make us better both on the top line, but I think are also going to give us efficiencies that flow through, as Ian was talking about with G&A leverage.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Citi.\nJon Tower: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, I know we've spoken quite a bit about some of the cost inflation and stuff like that running through the business across the globe in 2023. Curious if you can give us an indication on your thoughts regarding pricing versus the inflation expectations for the full year and how you're working with your franchisees across the globe to address that? And then second, if you could talk about the quarter-to-date industry data, particularly in the U.S., it's been quite strong to start the year. Curious to know if some of the strength that McDonald's saw in the fourth quarter has carried over into the first quarter? Thank you. \nIan F. Borden: Good morning Jon, let me start on that one. And maybe just to give a bit of texture to my answer, I'll talk about it in a couple of pieces. I'll start with the U.S. and then talk a little bit about IOM but maybe with a focus on Europe. I mean, I think in the U.S., we would say we're past the inflation peak and kind of heading on that downward slope. But certainly, we had high inflation, mid-teens in 2022 from a food and paper perspective. I think in 2023, we think our food and paper inflation is going to be kind of mid to high single digits. So still obviously very elevated from where it's been for a long time. And so in combination with that, you've also got energy prices that are up and interest rates and things like that, that are impacting us.  I think if you move to IOM with a focus on Europe, I think we're still working through the peak period of inflation. I don't think we think inflation will -- in Europe we will start to ease probably until mid-2023. In fact, we'll see some markets in Europe with higher levels of inflation in 2023 than we saw in 2022. And so I would say, on an IOM basis for 2023, we probably expect food and paper inflation to be kind of in that mid-teens, not substantially lower than what we saw in 2022. So I think that gives you an indication of the level of the inflationary pressure. Of course, energy prices in Europe, maybe while they haven't hit the peak, as I was talking about earlier because we've had a warmer winter in Europe so far, I mean the underlying tensions aren't fully resolved yet, and inflation levels and energy prices are certainly up significantly where they were 12 months or so ago.  And so I think from a pricing perspective, what we're trying to do is be very disciplined and be very consumer-led in our thinking. You may have heard me talk in the third quarter call just a little bit about the investments we've made over the last couple of years to really improve the tools, the data, and the analytics that our advisers use to provide recommendations to the business. Of course, as always, our franchisees make their own pricing decisions. But I think as Chris talked about, we feel good that we're being very disciplined around the pricing we're taking.  We're using a long-term mindset, knowing that what we want to continue to do is drive strong top line momentum so that we have that momentum through these pressures and then, of course, out of the pressures and begin to kind of recover margins and gain leverage as we go forward. And we think our system has done a really good job on that because when we look at our value for money and affordability scores, we continue to maintain those leadership positions. And so I think 2023 is kind of a moment in time where we're seeing kind of the peaks of those pressures but feel really good as we get out of 2023 that the momentum that we're going to continue to drive will keep us in a really strong position to start gaining leverage again.\nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Yes. I just would add, I mean, I've seen some of the industry reports on the momentum heading into 2023, and we feel good about how our business is performing. But I think Ian touched on one thing, just keep in mind, we've got Omicron, that's a tailwind. We've got good weather, not just in Europe, but there's favorable weather in the U.S. So there are some things there that are helping, I think, industry-wide, but we feel very good about the momentum we're starting the year off with.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thanks. Chris, you expressed the same macro concerns in Europe as last quarter. But within IOM, strong 4Q comps, the UK, France, and Germany, you called out really standout performers. And so you spoke about a few country-specific operating highlights. But can you talk about the degree that Europe is benefiting from trade-down from higher-priced dining and how you're positioning the business to sharpen the focus on value in 2023 while recognizing franchisee profitability in Europe is seeing the greatest challenge? And if I could just squeeze in one quick housekeeping question, how will the $100 million to $150 million of 2023 franchise release show up in the income statement and if you anticipate that to be front half or back half-weighted or spread evenly throughout the year would be helpful? Thanks. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Why don't I have Ian cover the housekeeping item, and then I'll get to your broader question about Europe and the consumer.\nIan F. Borden: Yes, hi Andrew. So just on the $100 million to $150 million, that obviously is directed to support franchisees. And so it would show up through our franchisee revenue in the income statement as we work through that. I'll give it back to Chris for the rest.\nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Yes. And to the question about trade-down and the benefits of that, we're seeing good balanced growth in Europe and in our IOM markets. So I wouldn't say that we are disproportionately benefiting from some sort of trade-down to the degree that we have visibility kind of at the different strata of the consumer, we're continuing to see that hold up well across sort of all consumer segments.\nMike Cieplak: I have time for one last question from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you so much for that question. The question is on CAPEX and just overall capital needs of the business. Certainly, appreciate the guide for fiscal 2023 at $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, but that includes new units on 400 IOM in U.S. units. So I guess there's a couple of different parts to this. Do you think -- is that 400 number kind of the right number to think about in these developed markets going forward or could that number necessarily increase, I guess, the first part? Secondly, you did mention the completion of EOTF in the U.S., largely in 2022 and I'm wondering if there's another large project, specifically, I guess, in the IOM markets, that may kind of take up for existing unit CAPEX? And finally, in the release, and I think this has been a really important thing for McDonald's' 90% cash conversion. I mean I suppose you mean of earnings of your net earnings, I mean, is that the right ratio that you expect to hit on an annual basis going forward, maybe getting a little bit of a preview of what you will talk about later this year at your analyst meeting? Thanks. \nChristopher J. Kempczinski: Yeah, good morning John, thanks for all that. So I think on the 400 openings, as Chris said, we'll have more to say on that later in the year. But I think what we've done well over the last couple of years is really build demand for the brand by investing in the brand, I think in doing a good job to resonate with consumers. And so certainly feel there's opportunity ahead. I think from a quantification standpoint, we'll talk about that, as I said, more later in the year. On 2023, the $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion of CAPEX, about half of that is going to go towards new unit growth. I would say one of the things as we work through COVID and dealt with kind of consumer shifts in behavior was we certainly understood there was an opportunity for us to deal -- obviously, we've got a lot more ordering channels coming into restaurants. I think that's certainly -- and with the demand and volume that we've created, has created some challenges just in managing the capacity and the volume of customers we're dealing with in some of our restaurants across our owned markets. And so some of that reinvestment CAPEX is just going to us kind of working through these new ordering channels like delivery and digital and just enabling our restaurants to be better set up to deal with the volume of business that they're handling and to make sure that they can continue to grow volume by having more capacity available as we go forward. And so some of that capital is going there. I think on the 90%, I think you should feel good that that's something that we feel will be in place going forward, as we've talked about in 93 [ph] in terms of converting our net income to free cash flow.\nMike Cieplak: Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thanks everyone for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor call. You may now disconnect.

Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I'm proud to report that our Q3 performance demonstrated our broad-based business momentum against an evolving macroeconomic backdrop. McDonald's unmatched scale and operational resilience powered by our three legged stool has enabled us to deliver strong results this quarter.  Global comp sales were up nearly 10% and most of our major markets are growing share which gives us confidence that we are operating from a position of strength even during difficult times. As the macroeconomic landscape continues to evolve and uncertainties persist, we continue to consider a wider range of scenarios as we look ahead. As I've said before, our base case scenario going forward is that we expect to experience a mild to moderate recession in the U.S., and one that will be potentially a little deeper and longer in Europe. That said we operate in more than 100 countries around the world in varying economic environments. This has provided our team's valuable experience as McDonald's has proven to be successful in just about any business environment.  I remain confident in our accelerated Accelerating the Arches strategy, as our teams around the world continue to execute at a high level. And thanks to the resilience of the system and our continued investments at scale, we're laser focused on meeting the changing needs of our customers.  Before we get into those details, I want to introduce Ian Borden, on his first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. Ian brings a wealth of experience to this role having spent the past several years and a member of our global senior leadership team. He first joined our system in Canada in 1994. And from there went on a bit of a McDonald's World Tour. Over the past 30 years he has served as CFO for Asia-Pac, Middle East and Africa region and CFO for Russia and Eastern Europe. He's also held several leadership roles across our markets and regions, most recently as President of McDonald's international. I'm thrilled for Ian to be stepping into this new role and I'll now turn it over to him to share more on our Q3 results.\nIan Borden : Thanks, Chris, and great to be with everyone this morning from my first earnings call. So let me start with a few headlines on our overall performance. Our global comp sales of 9.5% for the quarter are a testament to the continued resilience of our business. It goes without saying that we are seeing global macroeconomic challenges that haven't been experienced in many years. Inflationary pressures and related interest rate increases taken by central banks are combining to put significant pressure on the consumer and our industry.  Despite the challenging backdrop, our systems focus on accelerating the arches that I've seen it work across more than 100 countries gives me confidence in our ability to navigate these challenges. The power of our strategy is brought to life through our actions against our M, C and D framework, working together with the customer at the center. In the third quarter, we remain focused on delivering delicious and affordable food with the convenience McDonald's is known for, which is now more important than ever, to our customers. This continued to drive our market leadership and strong underlying sales growth across all segments of our business.  In our international operated markets, comp sales grew 8.5% for the quarter with positive comps across all markets. This demonstrates the underlying strength of the IOM segment where we continue to gain market share. In France, we're operating from a position of market share strength, particularly with families as French consumers have resumed more normal routines. And we continue to grow loyalty in the market with a record mix of our transactions coming through our mobile app. By utilizing global mobile app offers in combination with traditional value offerings, Germany further highlighted our affordability and accelerated loyalty adoption at the same time. This drove strong growth in digital sales, which now represent more than 50% of system wide sales in the market.  Australia showcased our beef equities with a winter together and Loving It campaign. Tapping into the role McDonald's plays in making everyday moments special. The campaign featured both the Angus and quarter pounder sandwiches and resulted in a meaningful lift in beef sales. And with the UK launch of My McDonald's rewards in July, we now have loyalty programs in place across all of our top-six global markets. The UK built on the successful rollout driving additional adoption with exclusive app offers throughout the quarter. And with the monopoly promotion in September, the team developed an innovative incentive that allowed customers to virtually peel their game board pieces right in the app.  The focus on driving digital engagement paid off as our active loyalty members grew to over 3 million in just the first three months. While the expiration of VAT benefits impacted our quarterly comp sales in the market, we continued to grow QSR our market share. Although our business performance has remained resilient, as I mentioned earlier, we recognize that this is a challenging environment. The inflationary impact on costs is putting pressure on restaurant cash flows for our franchisees, particularly in our European markets.  Similar to actions that we took during COVID, our financial strength puts us in a position to be there for franchisees that may need temporary and targeted support to ensure our system is financially healthy and aligned on continuing to drive growth.  Moving to the U.S., the efforts and investments by our franchisees employees, restaurant teams and suppliers over the last several years are paying off. The modernization of our state combined with strong discipline and execution across our core menu and backed by award winning marketing is connecting with customers and driving results. In the U.S., third quarter comp sales were up more than 6% marking our ninth consecutive quarter of growth and achieving positive comp sales in 22 of the last 23 quarters. Higher average check supported by strategic price increases and positive guest counts contributed to performance.  Loyalty remained a significant growth driver for the quarter, in part fueled by the camp McDonald's promotion. A year after the launch of my McDonald's rewards in the U.S. we continue to increase digital customer frequency quarter-after-quarter of the customers that have engaged with the app over the last year, about two thirds have been active in the last 90 days.  Turning to the international developmental license markets, comp sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter, with strong sales growth across all geographies in the segment. Japan delivered strong growth at the dinner day part with popular returning limited time offerings across both chicken and beef. We also highlighted our off-premise channels, further elevating customer convenience, with an emphasis on MC delivery.  It continues to be a challenging operating environment in China. With ongoing COVID resurgences and government restrictions, consumer confidence remains low. While comps for the quarter were slightly negative, the market continued to grow share, leaning into the strength of our delivery and digital business with the team on track to open about 800 restaurants this year, an all-time high. And now let me turn it back over to Chris. \nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, Ian. Over the last few months, I've visited markets around the world hearing from employees, franchisees and restaurant teams about how the challenges we face globally impact our restaurants locally. Three themes came through loud and clear. There is increasing uncertainty and unease about the economic environment, the resilience of the McFamily alongside our scale and efforts to build a more connected and convenient McDonald's set us apart. Our franchisees remain confident that we have the right business plans to work together and drive growth as a system. We see this in real time. Even as UK customers grapple with cost of living and energy impacts, our customers are coming back to McDonald's because of the value we offer. And in Germany, as customers deal with the highest inflation on record, our teams continue to focus on branded affordability. No matter the issues our customers face, we are dedicated to meeting their needs. Rig Croc said it best, when we look after our customers, the business will look after itself. And I'm proud that our business can be there to provide a warm space and a hot meal for families when they need it most. Accelerating the Arches of our playbook that is guiding our business and driving growth. By focusing on executing our strategy, I am confident that McDonald's will continue to show up for our customers across our M,C and Ds. Our foresight to double down on digital and delivery to execute culturally relevant marketing campaigns across the world to highlight our core menu capabilities and to invest in our asset base is really paying off. Our size, scale and financial results put us in an advantaged position as we head into more volatile times, and we will lean into the strengths of the system. Digital is a primary driver to improve the customer experience, reduce complexity and drive profitability. In our top six markets, it now represents over one third of system-wide sales, fueled by over 43 million active customers on our app in the third quarter. In the U.S., our digital business is powered by over 25 million active customers driven through my McDonald's rewards. Our loyalty program is driving growth and exceeding expectations. Delivery also remains a key driver of our business to enhance convenience, we're integrating a new feature where customers can earn loyalty points order and pay for delivery within the McDonald's app. The streamlined and more rewarding experience is available to customers in the UK and is currently being rolled out in the U.S. Further implementation of this solution will only enhance our strong performance as the third quarter was one of our highest delivery sales quarters ever in the U.S. Each reward a customer redeems and each preference of customer shares on our app helps power our personal touch. We are using this deeper understanding of our customers to create relevant content and offers through the channels they prefer. By tailoring messages, our customers feel more connected to McDonald's, ultimately driving engagement and increasing frequency. It also gives us more ways to reunite with customers who haven't visited in a while. Our markets are also using digital to drive engagement with our fans through exclusive activations. In Australia, the success of their digitally exclusive monopoly program speaks to the endurance of our marketing platforms and our ability to adapt existing equities to meet our customers where they are. The team incorporated loyalty into the Monopoly promotion in order to make it even more rewarding for consumers and the promotion drove significant incremental sales for the market.  Marketing has been an important growth driver for us. Our creative excellence is making our brand not just more recognizable, but more relevant to our fans. I can confidently say that the McDonald's marketing team is truly firing on all cylinders. Earlier this month, through a collaboration with Cactus plant fleet market in the U. S., we tapped in one of the most nostalgic McDonald's experiences, enjoying a happy meal as a kid and repackaged it to make it relevant for adult fans. This promotion reengaged our fans to our core food, including Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets. It's fair to say that this sentimental experience was a success as 50% of our supply of collectibles was sold in the first four days of the promotion. These increased visits also drove the highest weekly digital transactions ever in the U.S. business, and we expect October comp sales in the U.S. to be in the low double digits. The heart of this marketing idea taps into emotional connections with our fans, adding the fun of collectibles with a relevant artist. All of these campaigns featured our core menu items and built upon our successful marketing platforms, which kept operations simple and brought our customers closer to the iconic menu items they love. Speaking of our food, as we come up with fresh spins in our classics, we're creating new craveable moments for a new generation of McDonald's fans. In Italy, we drove strong comps for the quarter as we highlighted simple yet compelling core menu items paired alongside great marketing with a Big Mac event featuring a Chicken Big Mac and a Bacon Big Mac. We're also focused on growing our business through chicken by leaning into the strength of core icons like Chicken McNuggets. At the same time, we are very confident in new global favorites like the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich,-- and we will look to bring a select number of these new equities to scale. Canada and Germany launched them at Crispy in Q3, and it launched in our most recent market the UK just last week. Australia recently promoted a spice event featuring Spiced McNuggets and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Spain promoted Mix Spice in July and is planning future spicy events to bring relevant taste and flavors to their customers. Chicken is a strong growth driver of comp sales in the quarter across our major markets and will remain a focus for us as we continue to grow our global market share in this important category.  Our success wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our restaurant teams that I saw in action and heard from directly during my travels. The people that bring the McDonald's experience to life in our restaurants are truly the face of our brand. That's the promise of a new advertising campaign for Best Burger in Belgium that highlights the individuals making our delicious food versus just the juicy burgers themselves. The people in our restaurants are truly our secret sauce and the ingredient we are most proud of. Thanks to the resilience of the system and our continued investment at scale in the M,C and Ds, we're staying relevant to our customers as their needs continue to change. Now I'll turn it back to Ian to finish walking through the financials.\nIan Borden: Thanks, Chris. Our strong performance during the third quarter resulted in earnings per share of $2.68. This reflects an adjusted increase of 4% in constant currencies after excluding the prior year gain for the partial divestiture of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. Company-operated margins remain pressured by significant commodity and wage inflation as well as elevated energy costs. We believe these pressures will continue to impact margins for the next several quarters. G&A costs increased about 7% in constant currencies for the quarter, driven by a combination of continued investment in growth-driving initiatives such as restaurant technology and inflationary pressures on costs. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be between 2. 3% and 2.4% of system-wide sales. This is primarily due to the inflationary pressures I just mentioned as well as a stronger U.S. dollar having a greater impact on sales, which are predominantly outside of the U.S., whereas most of our G&A expense is U.S. dollar based. However, despite these headwinds, our year-to-date adjusted operating margin percentage has grown and is now in the mid-40s. Our effective tax rate was 21.9% for the quarter. The strong U.S. dollar I just mentioned, created a foreign currency headwind to quarter three earnings per share of $0.19. And based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to impact fourth quarter earnings per share by between $0.14 to $0.16, but the full year headwind totaling about $0.50. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the remainder of the year. And transitioning to capital expenditures, we now anticipate spending about $2 billion, an adjustment from our previous guidance due to foreign exchange rates and slightly lower spend. A few weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 10%, the company's 46th consecutive annual increase. As we've talked about today, the Accelerating the Arches plan is driving strong financial results and cash flow. As we continue to execute against this plan, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver sustained long-term profitability for our system, all of which is reflected in the recent dividend increase. Before I close and hand it back to Chris, I just want to take the opportunity to personally congratulate Kevin on his successful tenure as McDonald's CFO. He's been a great partner to me as I've transitioned into this role, and I look forward to building on the strong foundations that he has put in place. It was a pleasure to meet so many of you last month. As I mentioned then, I expect that you'll find a great deal of consistency between Kevin and myself particularly when it comes to the financial priorities of our business. While the environment remains dynamic and challenging times may lie ahead, I remain incredibly confident in our strategy our business momentum and our system. I look forward to meeting and working with all of you. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, Ian. Before we close and head into the Q&A portion, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that next week marks my third year as CEO of McDonald's. And therefore, my third year of discussions with many of you in this capacity. In some of our first conversations in late 2019, I highlighted three areas that I expected to focus on as CEO. The need to elevate our marketing with programs that are culturally relevant and accretive to our business, the need to develop a digital strategy to drive frequency, retention and engagement at scale and the need to ensure that McDonald's attracts and retains the best talent in the world. You saw much of this come to life in our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy, which provided a road map to focus the system across our M,C and Ds. Since our conversations first began and in the many we've had over the last three years, I'm proud of what McDonald's has accomplished on these fronts, all while navigating an increasingly complicated world.  Our investments in digital are keeping us relevant to customers and creating business momentum. In addition to what he insured, I'll just emphasize that delivery now is in over 100 countries and our loyalty program is now in over 50 markets around the world, driving growth and exceeding expectations. Our marketing programs have enabled us to recapture the imagination of our customers, bringing new joy and excitement to their interactions with our brand. With fresh approaches, we are staying relevant to the fans we serve across generations who are driving meaningful contributions to our business. And when you look at the leadership team that the global segment and market levels, I am proud to have welcomed and promoted leaders who infuse new energy, new perspective, deep values and strong capabilities to the McDonald's system. Looking forward, my focus and responsibility is to ensure that McDonald's uses its position of strength that we find ourselves in today to create even more value for our stakeholders. We will do this by continuing to work even more collaboratively and effectively in a world that is only moving faster. We will do this by building on our inherent strengths, harnessing our competitive advantages and investing in innovation that allows us to deliver on our brand promise to consumers. And we will do this by focusing collectively on solving the needs of our customers.  That is ultimately how we will ensure that we are unleashing the full potential of McDonald's to those we serve. I'd like to extend a whole heart of thanks to the McDonald's system for these collective successes and everything that we will continue to deliver in the future, and thanks to all of you for the discussions that we've had up to this point. Now we'll begin Q& A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions].\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass : Thank you and good morning. Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay.\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah, we can hear you John. Thanks. \nJohn Glass : Great. Good morning. I was curious about the IOM markets and your comments about the economic pressures there. Have you seen evidence of trade down, it wouldn't seem such given same-store sales, but maybe underneath that, is there evidence of consumer strain and maybe it's trade down or what have you. And can you also talk about or update your inflationary expectations for that market? I thought the margins were strong, but you also talked about the need to support franchisees given their cash flow situation. So maybe just an update on where you think inflation in the back half or fourth quarter and early next year leads you to in IOMs.\nChris Kempczinski: John, it's Chris. So if you focus on our IOM markets, right now, broadly, we are not seeing significant trade down happening in our menu. I think we do believe we're benefiting from trade down that happens as perhaps people coming out of other parts of IEO into QSR. So we do think that we're perhaps seeing some of that benefit. But within our own business in IOM, we're not seeing significant evidence of trade down there.  As far as how we're thinking about the market, it's mostly right now showing up just in sentiment where we're seeing consumer sentiment in Europe remains low. Obviously, a lot of that is driven by the inflation that they're seeing, cost of living increases related to both food but also energy. And so that's what is weighing on our mind. You've seen also the Central Banks in Europe today. I think this morning, the ECB raised interest rates another 75 basis points. So all of that is factoring into what we think is going to be a challenging environment in Europe. But it's certainly, as we mentioned in our comments, putting some pressure on the P&Ls of our franchisees. As far as outlook and how we're thinking about that, I'll maybe just have Ian give you his thoughts.\nIan Borden: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. So maybe just a little bit of a build on what Chris has talked about. I mean I think certainly in Europe, we're seeing higher levels of inflation. I think you've heard us talk to that before, in food and paper and also in energy prices, which obviously are impacted, particularly in Europe, knowing some of the European markets were quite dependent on Russia as an energy source and have had to obviously look for alternative supply. So I think you've got the combination of those pressures hitting some of our European markets. What I would say about Europe is it's obviously a wider range of scenarios because the context is not consistent. There are differences across the European markets that we do business in. I think if I took a step back, though, I just go to the -- you look at IOM an 8.5% comp in quarter three. I mean, I think as Chris talked about, we continue to see strong, broad-based and consistent momentum across the business. I think we're -- we've got some inherent strengths in Europe, as I'm sure you've heard us talk about previously which is the fact that we've got a modernized asset base. We've done a lot of work, I think, on marketing and around our MCD framework. There are less competitive activity across a number of our European markets. And so our business and our brand is in a position of strength. And I certainly think that's a strong tailwind for us as we kind of head into this more volatile period that Chris referred to.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. \nDennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. And I wanted to just ask a similar question as it relates to the U.S. If anything different from a behavior perspective and I guess more with your customer. And I guess, more importantly, given you've got positive guest counts in the U.S., maybe one of the only brands seeing that right now and the strength that you've seen over the last few quarters last years. Is there anything more you can say about the customer now? Has the customer evolved at all, Chris, over under your tenure? Anything more that you can about that customer, how it may have changed? And what that means kind of on the go forward. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, I think the biggest thing that's changed over the last several years with the customer is just this focus on the kind of takeaway part of the business. And that shows up whether it's in delivery and the significant growth that we've seen in delivery. Digital has been a key enabler on. And so for us, I think that's been the biggest thing that we've seen. Certainly, we still have a dine-in business, but it is less pronounced than it was pre-COVID, and we're certainly expecting that, that's going to sustain in terms of just this focus on drive-thru and what we're describing as the 3Ds.  So I think that's been one broad-based change that we've seen. I do think that because of the environment that we're in right now and the investments that we've made previously, we feel very good about sort of what is the McDonald's value proposition. And it shows up when we look at consumer scores around value for money, affordability we see in the U.S. that we continue to lead in this, and it's allowed us to push through some of this pricing. But I think because of the strength of the brand and the proposition as evidenced by the results, the consumers are willing to tolerate it. And I think they're willing to do that because of, again, all the other things that we've done to just strengthen our offering, the brand proposition, et cetera. So I think that for us, as we look out forward, it gives us confidence that, yes, we're going to continue to have inflation into 2023, both food and paper as well as labor, but we like our position relative to competitors in terms of where we stand.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez : My question is on the U.S. business. You're clearly gaining share and executing its what is certainly not the easiest macro environment. So just wondering if you could isolate maybe the one or two things that you're doing better than your peers and discuss why you believe that. Is it staffing, your ability to hire, retain talent? Is this about real estate perhaps speed of service or maybe any other factors that you think you have contributed to your relative performance gap versus peers.\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. I'm going to maybe take you back to where we were several years ago in the U.S., where we talked talk about, and we were in a different time and performance was in a little different place. And we talked about needing to do a number of things to improve our relative position. We talked about needing to invest in our asset base. And as you know, we've cumulatively invested about $9 billion over the last five or six years between us and the franchisees in updating our asset base in the U.S. We talked about improving the quality of our food, improving our operations, which we've done, where speed of service is faster today than it was in 2019. We've been able to do that despite a more challenging labor environment. And I also talked about the brand and digital. So for us, at least the way I look at it, and I think the U.S. team would look at it, it's not any one thing that is the answer. It's the fact that we've been able to move over a number of years on a number of these things that gives us the momentum that the team is driving right now. And of course, I want to acknowledge also just the great partnership we're getting from our franchisees and from our suppliers in the U.S. because it's certainly a team effort.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino : Hi. I have a question about Europe. I think you referenced that you may need to provide support to some of your franchisees. And I was hoping that perhaps you could elaborate on what you mean by that and how extensive that support might need to be in the current environment, just to kind of frame up, I guess, the health of the system in general? Thanks.\nIan Borden : Good morning, David, it's Ian. So thanks for the question. Let me try and hit on that one. Look, I think what I would start with is part of our strategic advantage as a system is our scale and financial strength. And I think as you heard me talk to in my remarks, and Chris alluded to it earlier, our franchisees in Europe are seeing elevated inflation, particularly obviously in food and paper and energy prices. Energy prices, as an example, and some of our European markets would be up two to three times from what they were 12 months ago.  So when you put the combination of all those impacts together, there's a fair bit of headwind in some of our European markets on our franchisee cash flow. I think using our financial strength to provide support to certain franchisees who may need it in a targeted and temporary way I think is -- we think of that obviously to keep our system financially healthy but also to keep the system aligned and focused behind the things that are going to drive growth and investing behind those initiatives that are going to continue to drive growth, certainly think of that as a strategic advantage. And so you may remember back during the COVID period, we made some decisions around providing temporary and targeted support. And I can tell you, just from my old role leading our international business that I think those were critically important strategic decisions that were a key factor in the acceleration and momentum that our system had as we came out of that COVID period. And so we've got the capability to do that. If we need to do that, and I think that, as I said, is a strategic advantage that we carry with us.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman : I wanted to ask what the marketing strategies of Can McDonald's in July, the partnership with Castle market more recently. How are these partnerships helping you either reach a new audience or increase engagement with your audience? I guess what changes are you seeing in terms of your consumer base? And do you generally see once you get the increase in digital utilization of a lot of these programs that, that sustains. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks for the question. For us, one of the things that I've certainly believed about our brand is McDonald's is one of those brands that actually is very much a part of culture. And you see it when you just look at social media and all the ways that consumers will talk about on their own, McDonald's and their McDonald's experience. And I think what we in the past maybe didn't do enough of is lean into our relevance and how our brand is a part of culture. And so I think what you've seen over the last several years for us and credit to the marketing team and our agency partners on this is just finding more ways that we can connect our equities that we can connect our experience to what's also going on in culture. And whether it's Famous orders or Can McDonald's or now more recently the adult happy meals and the McRib coming back, just all these different things shows to us and just as a reminder that we are charged with shepherding and stewarding one of the most fantastic equities in the world and that we've actually got to find ways to continue to keep it fresh. In terms of evidence of it, it's just -- it's the little things. So when you see actually that we're selling out of our adult happy meals, and it's happening in days, not weeks. That is a real proof point when you see that people are posting on social media the fun ways where they've got their buckets and ready to go out and do Halloween. All of those are proof points for us. And what I say to our team as well is if you're having to sort of look with the microscope to see the impact of marketing on your P&L, then it's not big enough. And I think what we're starting to see now is we're starting to see marketing and our marketing programs show up as significant meaningful comp drivers for us. That's what gives us confidence about that we're finding that right engagement with the consumer.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber : Great. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask about the health of the U.S. consumer. Obviously, the trends you posted remained really strong and encouraging. But I guess, two pieces. One, can you help frame maybe the level of price that's running through the system right now as a component of the comp with that encouraging sign of positive traffic. And then I wanted to see if you're seeing any sort of deltas or differences between dayparts as the consumer is increasingly pressured by the macro and if you're seeing any consumer behavior changes related to that just yet. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Let's have Ian, maybe just take the first couple of parts to that, and then I can maybe offer just a few more general thoughts on it.\nIan Borden : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jared. So let me I think you talk a little bit about pricing and just kind of, I think the reactions that we're seeing in the U.S., just knowing the U.S. is a little further along, and I think our data is a little clearer there. So I think if you look at our quarter three comp in the U.S. of just over 6%, that was obviously largely driven by average check. But as you noted, we had a slightly stronger positive contribution from guest counts in quarter three than we saw in quarter two. So again, the majority of that check growth continues to come through price.  Year-over-year in quarter three, our price -- average price increase in the U.S. was just over 10%. And that's roughly where we expect the kind of the full year pricing in the U.S. to be. We continue to see pretty good flow-through in the U.S., about 70%, which would be close to our historical range. And so if you think about that price increase of roughly 10% flow-through of about 70%, the difference between that and the average check growth that we're seeing is really -- continues to be driven by two factors that we've talked about previously. The first one would be less units per transaction. Most of that is being driven by kind of a reversion of ordering channels. So obviously, during COVID, we saw elevated ordering through kind of off-premise channels like delivery and drive-through. We're getting obviously more traffic now back in restaurants, for example, drive-thru is basically back to kind of what it was pre-COVID in terms of percentage of sales.  Obviously, we continue to see elevated delivery ordering. But in total, we still see more units per transaction than we were seeing pre-COVID, but you had a reversion to more traditional ordering channels. And then the second factor but to a lesser extent, would be we are seeing some trade down. That trade down is mainly with our lower income consumers, and we're seeing that shift from meal purchases to more value offer items. And so those would be the two factors that are kind of offsetting pricing to get to that net average check growth. I think to the second part, so I would say, in total, we're getting pretty healthy continued flow through, I think, which is a good sign that we're getting the pricing between balance right with our U.S. consumers.  I think on the second part on day parts, what I would say is we're seeing pretty consistently strong comps in the U.S. business across all of the dayparts. I think dinner and breakfast would be a little better. But as I say, pretty consistently strong. And again, that gives us a pretty good indication that what we're doing is resonating with consumers pretty broadly.\nChris Kempczinski: Nothing to add, Ian handled it all. So I think we're ready for the next question.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. \nAndrew Charles : Great. Ian, I appreciate the FX guidance for 4Q, but just given the extraordinary strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent months and unusual FX circumstances. Can you perhaps comment on the impact of current exchange rates on 2023 EPS? Are math just somewhere around a $0.25 to $0.30 impact. And just want to see if we're thinking about that correctly. \nIan Borden : Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Look, I'm not going to get into talking about 2023 today. To be honest, we're still in the midst of working through our 2023 plans. In fact, we've got our Managing Directors coming into Chicago in a couple of weeks to take us through their plans for 2023. So I think that's something that we can give you more texture around when we get into our quarter four earnings call.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChris Carril : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe following up on some of the earlier questions, I did want to ask about the competitive environment in the U.S., maybe both for the burger category and just broader fast food. And specifically, I mean, do you see potential for increased promotional activity here going forward? Or are you expecting the industry and peers to kind of remain largely rational here going forward just given the still dynamic and evolving backdrop here? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. Certainly, our expectation is that the industry is going to stay rational from a pricing standpoint. And I think part of that is just going to be born out of self interest, which is everybody is experiencing the food and paper inflation, everybody is experiencing the labor inflation. And some of our competitors, their franchisees are not in the same position as our franchisees. So I think even if there is a desire to try to get more promotional in some areas to address maybe any traffic headwinds that somebody might face. I think you're going to run into a lot of resistance from franchisees. We're just not going to be in a position to gauge in that. So our expectation is the environment is going to continue to stay rational.  I think the other thing that's going on right now is you just have food away from home versus food at home. You still have significant gaps there. I think we are in 2022, the gap between food away from home versus food at home. It's the widest gap that it's ever been. So there is still a benefit that the industry is getting relative to food at home that I think is keeping everybody being smart about pricing. And then the last thing I would say for us, and I mentioned a little bit earlier for us is that what we look at is we just look at our value and affordability and industry-wide, the industry overall is doing well on value and affordability. And we also like our relative position. I mean we are leading the industry as we have historically on our value and affordability to gap versus the industry.  So those are all things that we monitor and look at, but the expectation is certainly that the industry is going to stay rational.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein : Great. Shifting gears maybe to China, specifically. I think you mentioned opening a record 800 units this year. Wondering whether that's safe to assume that's accelerating into '23. I think you mentioned that comps were slightly negative. I'm just trying to assess whether there's any reason for concern on the underlying fundamentals of the business? Or do you really believe it's purely COVID. Any kind of updated thoughts on the region, especially with the most recent political environment in China creating some incremental headwinds. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: So thanks, Jeff. Let me start knowing in the last role that I had, I was overseeing China as part of that remiss. Look, I think as you heard in my opening comments, I think China continues to be impacted by the Zero COVID policy that continues to be in place. And obviously, that continues to be disruptive, not just to us, but I think to consumer confidence in the kind of broader macro environment in China. So I think that's certainly what we feel is the driver of the shorter-term results and challenge in China. As you heard me talk to, we continue to gain share. It's a pretty competitive marketplace, as you would know. So I think we feel the team in China has done a pretty nice job to work through this more challenging period. The 800 openings, I think you can expect that'll be kind of consistent as we go forward. I certainly think I think, speaks to the confidence we have in the longer-term opportunity in China, which remains in place, but that volatility, I think, is going to exist until there's a change in kind of focus about how they're handling COVID.\nIan Borden : Yeah. The only thing that I would add, just keep in mind that in China, there were still 33 cities and about 65 million people in this last quarter that were in either full or partial lockdown as a result of the 0 COVID policy. So I think sometimes here in the U.S. in our western markets where we're in a different position relative to the pandemic. we sometimes lose sight of in China, there is still significant restrictions, which is impacting mobility and ultimately, that impacts our business. But long term, our outlook on China remains very bullish. We're going to continue to build restaurants at an aggressive pace like I was talking about. And we do hope and expect that in 2023, the situation in China is going to improve for us.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. You there, John?\nJohn Ivankoe : Sorry about that. I had that different conference call that [Indiscernible]. Thank you. The G&A level that you talked about 2.3% to 2.4% You're obviously spending a lot of money, but you're clearly, you're getting results. So I just wanted to kind of have a sense both in G&A and if we can also comment on CapEx just future spending levels for the business. I mean is this kind of the time in the environment where the system might be looking for efficiencies or is at the opposite that you actually have an opportunity to spend more and get more and drive future sales and overall market share, again, both on G&A and in CapEx? Thanks.\nIan Borden: Yeah. Thanks, John. Let me take those two questions. I think on G&A, as you kind of heard me talk to in my commentary, there are really a couple of drivers for this year that resulted in that adjusted outlook. The first one is the stronger impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. So if you think of our G&A, let's call it, formula to get to the percentage, 60% of our sales come from outside of the U.S. So obviously, we're translating those sales back into less U.S. dollars and 70% of our G&A spend is U.S. dollar based. So that's the first impact. The second impact is obviously just the general inflationary pressures that we're seeing on costs, which obviously is also coming to play in our G&A expenses. I think what I would say coming into the role is certainly, it's an area that I'm going to be focused on. I think we continue to believe that in terms of the running the business part of our G&A spend, we should be able to drive efficiency and gain leverage as we continue to go through our top-line as we go forward. That's important for two reasons, one, the efficiency part, but also we want to make sure we've got the G&A capacity to ensure that we can spend on areas like technology and digital or innovation where we want to drive things that are going to drive growth. But I think the net of that formula is that we continue to believe we should gain leverage in G&A as we go forward. I think the second part on capital I think capital, there were kind of two reasons why we adjusted guidance down from the $2 billion to $2.2 billion to now about $2 billion. Again, one of them is just the stronger U.S. dollar, about 60% of our capital spend is outside of the U.S. So we're just translating that spend back into fewer U. S. dollars. I think the second bit is slightly less openings due to kind of the permit time lines in some markets, slightly fewer projects getting done, just the project lead times. What I would say on capital is, I think -- and again, coming out of my previous role, we continue to believe we've got an opening opportunity across many of our owned markets, we continue to get really good returns on new restaurant openings. I think that's something that we'll continue to look at as we go forward. And I think, Chris, you want to just jump in.\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. Just a couple of closing thoughts here. I appreciate it in the question that for us and the way I think about it is it's the effectiveness of our spend. And as you noted in the question, we've been able to see that for the investment in the G&A, it's certainly driving the type of performance. But I would tell you that I think we have an opportunity to get even more effective on the impact of our G&A investments. And for me, it shows up, we're still too slow. I think we have to get faster. I don't think that we're fully leveraging our scale. We have to find ways to do that. We're still solving the same problems multiple times in different markets as opposed to having one solution that we can very quickly share across the globe. So as I look at the effectiveness of G&A, there's still a lot of work for us in that area.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner : Good morning. Thank you. Just with your base case, being a U.S. recession and I think a deeper one in Europe, it's obviously harder not to go back and recall how strong the U.S. business performed best in class during the '08, '09 recession period. And so do you see the business as offensively positioned today as it was then? And I also just wanted you to comment some more on the low-end consumer. You're just -- your U.S. trends are so strong in the third quarter in October in light of the weakening we're hearing about this low-end consumer. I know you said you're seeing trade down from the low-end consumer within your own business. But as this cohort of consumers just generally seeks more value, is this actually [technical difficulty]. \nMike Cieplak: You're breaking up a little bit, Brian. We'll try to maybe answer your question that we could hear.\nIan Borden : Yes, I'll answer what I could hear. And then afterwards, if we missed anything, you can follow up with Mike on this. But certainly, there are lessons from 2008-2009, but there are also differences from 2008-2009. It is true that our business performed well in that last downturn period, and there were a number of factors for that. Keep in mind, back at that time, we had dollar menu as an embedded part our value offering. We also were launching McCafe and starting to scale that. So those were things that were helpful to us in the last in the last downturn.  We're in a different dynamic right now. You have not just pressure on inflation with food and paper, but you've also got labor inflation in a very tight labor market. So that's different than 2008-2009. Our expectation is that we are going to perform well in this environment, certainly on a relative basis to our competitors here, but there are different factors at play. And I think there are going to be different drivers. It's this focus on digital and delivery. We do think that those are going to be more pronounced now and the fact that we have scale, and we also have the ability to do what we think at lower cost than our competitors. That's going to be one thing that we believe works in our favor. The fact, as I mentioned earlier, that our brand and our asset base, we think, is in a better position gives us a little bit more pricing power than maybe in the past, we were leaning in the dollar menu. We actually think we've got pricing power right now. And the only other thing I would just add as evidence of that is one of the things that we look at as we look at our share by income group. And in the U.S., we can actually look at what is our share amongst low-income consumers. We're gaining share right now among low-income consumers. And that goes back to the fact that we are positioned as the leading brand in terms of value for money and affordability. So as long as we continue to stay on the right side of that, we are seeing the benefit, like I said, with the low-income consumer and to the degree that we end up in a more challenging economic environment in 2023, that's going to be helpful to our business trends.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you. Question on Europe and the IOM during this quarter. Coca-Cola mentioned that there was a strong summer in Europe, partially helped by weather, but then weather was negative towards the end of the quarter. So I would imagine there might be some noise because of weather, and there might be noise that tease out in terms of COVID comparisons. But are you seeing any real trends in Europe in recent months in terms of sales and traffic and has there been any slowing in particular markets that you would attribute to consumer confidence and discretionary income. And then also, given what you know about what's going to happen in terms of rising utilities in the coming months, what impact do you think these will have on your IOM company restaurant margins and consumer traffic. I know the last part is difficult, but any thoughts would be helpful. Thanks. \nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. Thanks, David. Well, look, I think what I would say in Europe on trends is I think we've seen pretty good consistency of strength across our European markets. So don't think we've been impacted by the weather factor that you talked about, perhaps as others have. I think our momentum there is really strong. And as you and I have talked about before, just as Chris talked about, the strength of our brand in Europe, again, modernized asset base. I think strong teams, strong alignment with our franchisees and our system in Europe.  All of those things are coming to play. And as you heard Chris talked about a little bit in the U.S. context I just think all of those things coming together put us in a position of strength. And if you look at things like value for money and affordability across the majority of our European markets, we are the leader on those measures, which I think are really important as we head into this more dynamic environment. I think on margins, as you heard me talk to in my opening remarks. Certainly, in Europe, if you look at food and paper, we think inflation in Europe is going to be a little higher and last a little longer than what we are seeing in the U.S. Energy prices, as I talked to earlier in some of our European markets are up two to three times what they were 12 months ago. So those are certainly pressures that are facing some of our markets and certainly our franchisees in our European business.  I think we've done a lot of work over the last couple of years around pricing capability. And what I mean by that is the advisories that we use, the tools, the data and the analytics. So I feel like we're in a good position where we're using the right facts and data the right consumer insights to make really, I think, consumer-facing decisions, and we're taking the right levels of pricing and getting that balance right between recovering inflation, but also not getting ahead of the consumer. And I think the momentum to Europe kind of speaks to how we're doing on that.\nIan Borden : And I would just add, one of the things that is a factor in all of this is we give pricing recommendations, but ultimately, it's up to the franchisees as to whether they adopt those pricing recommendations. And we're still seeing very strong adherence with our franchisees to our pricing recommendations, which we take as a signal that there's confidence in how we're going about the decision-making on that.\nMike Cieplak: As we near the hour, we got time for one more question. From Greg Francfort with Guggenheim.\nGreg Francfort: Hey, I have a two-part question. I know, Mike, you might kill me for that. But the first one is this really the McRib fare well toward? That's the first one. And then the second one is a follow-up to John's question from earlier. Maybe can you talk about how you're thinking about accelerating unit growth. You talked a little bit about delays in permitting, but the confidence in the timing and magnitude of maybe getting back up close to kind of 3.5% to 4% unit growth when we might expect it to happen. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Well, the McRib is the goat of sandwiches on our menu. And so like the GOAT of Michael Jordan, Tom Brady and others, you're never sure if they're fully retired or not. Ian, over to you. \nIan Borden : Yeah. I think I think Greg, what I would just reiterate is what I talked to earlier. I mean, I think if you look across our IOM markets and the U.S., I think you've heard us talk about the strength of the brand and the business. I think certainly, we continue to see, as I talked about earlier, really good returns around the unit openings that we are doing in those markets. I think certainly, there's more opportunity there. And I think that's something we'll talk to you more about as we kind of get into 2023 and our fourth quarter earnings.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. Thanks, everybody, for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-26 10:14:04", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Hello, and welcome to the McDonald's Second Quarter 2022 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and reenter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.  And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud to report that our Q2 performance was yet another demonstration of our broad-based business momentum, with global comp sales up nearly 10%, and most of our major markets continuing to grow market share. One thing is clear. The world continues to move in fast and often unforeseen ways, as it does, the McDonald's \u2013  But before we get into details of the past quarter, I want to offer up a few words about Kevin Ozan, who is joining today's call for the final time as McDonald's Chief Financial Officer. According to, Kevin, this is his 30th earnings call as CFO, but who's counting. To say that Kevin has had a profound impact on McDonald's is an understatement, and I should note that this impact isn't coming to an end just yet. But as he transitions from his duties as CFO it\u2019s a perfect time to reflect on what he has done in this seat. When Kevin first took the reins as CFO in Q1 2015, comparable sales and guest counts were declining globally and across each geographic segment. And there were real questions about the growth outlook for the company. Rising customer and investor expectations demanded a clear vision and voice, which Kevin ably provided. Kevin has been a constant in shepherding McDonald's through unprecedented change again and again, from leading the company's financial turnaround in 2015 and helping create our last two strategic growth plans, to navigating through a global pandemic and exiting a major market. Kevin has seen it all. During his time as CFO, the company increased system-wide sales by over 25% to more than a $100 billion, increased the number of restaurants worldwide by more than 10% to nearly 40,000 restaurants and returned over $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As just one barometer of Kevin's impact, McDonald's stock has appreciated 150% during his tenure. Anyone who's worked with Kevin knows his leadership is as much about what he does as how he does it. His insightful strategic approach to the business is matched by his ability to make human connections at all levels and with all stakeholders across our system. It's safe to say that Kevin is one of the most beloved senior leaders in our organization. But like I said, Kevin is not going anywhere just yet. He's been promoted to a new elevated role as our Senior Executive Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, where he'll work closely with me until his retirement next year. I'll look to his counsel as we execute against our accelerating the Arches strategy and identify areas where we can continue to evolve this strategy to meet the needs of customers long into the future. I expect we'll be sharing more down the road with all of you. Kevin, this isn't goodbye, not by a long shot, but on behalf of the entire McDonald's system, it's an opportune time to say thank you. Now on to the business operating environment. As we entered the year, we knew we were facing rising inflation, a surge in COVID-19 cases and the return of government restrictions in many markets, exacerbating labor shortages and supply chain challenges. Over the last six months, the macro uncertainty has only increased. We now face war in Europe. Inflation is running at its highest levels in 40 years, interest rates are rising to levels we haven't seen in years. All of this is contributing to weak consumer sentiment around the world and the possibility of a global recession. We're mindful of these risks, and we're planning for a wider range of scenarios. And while our McDonald's business continues to perform well, this is a very challenging environment for our McFamily, from restaurant teams, to franchisees, to suppliers. But we're united in our purpose to feed and foster the communities in which we operate, to provide an affordable destination for a delicious meal. Now more than ever, that is what our customers are seeking, which is why we feel so well positioned and confident in our continued success. Our global system is aligned behind a comprehensive strategy that is centered on the customer. This is strengthening our brand, which is driving broad-based market share gains. I mentioned during our last quarter that we would provide an update on the state of our business in Russia. It became increasingly clear the Russian war against Ukraine meant that McDonald's wouldn't be able to continue to operate in Russia in a way that would be accretive to our business objectives or aligned with our values. That's why in May, we announced that we would exit the market and sell our restaurants to a Russian buyer to be operated under a different identity. While the Golden Arches no longer shine in Russia, we are continuing to support our people in Ukraine and remain ever hopeful for a resolution of this conflict. Now for more on our Q2 numbers let me turn it over to Kevin, so he can give his 30th and final quarterly earnings readout. Kevin?\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris, and thank you for the kind words. As Chris mentioned, global comp sales were up nearly 10% in the second quarter, demonstrating the continued resilience of our business, despite the challenging environment. In fact, when we look at our three-year comp growth with the US over 19% and our IOM and IDL segments, both more than 15%, we see that our business around the world has been extremely resilient through the tumultuous last few years. Our quarterly results reflect strong underlying sales growth across all segments, a direct result of remaining customer focused and executing against our strategy. In our international operated markets, we continued to gain QSR traffic share, as markets showcased our iconic core equities and further capitalized on our digital channels. This fueled comp sales growth of 13% for the segment, with positive comps across all markets. Recovery in Germany and France continued, as remaining government restrictions eased early in the quarter. Germany built on their successful launch of loyalty at the end of last year and ran a Big Mac celebration campaign using mobile app offers to further drive digital adoption. In France, we highlighted our core burgers with strong marketing behind our triple cheeseburger, helping grow QSR market share to another record high level. Canada continued to prioritize convenience, as the market accelerated digital momentum with always on Loyalty messaging. We also featured a summer drink days promotion, highlighting our strong value proposition across all dayparts.  Australia built on their first quarter launch of Loyalty and accelerated digital engagement across the market with a strong lineup of mobile app offers. And we partnered with Australian Pop Star, the Kid Leroy, whose famous order was available exclusively through our mobile app and McDelivery.  In the UK, the return of the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich and Big Tasty promotion drove significant incremental sales. A daily digital sales calendar also helped build our digital customer base, leading up to the recent launch of Loyalty. While the expiration of VAT benefits impacted our quarterly comp sales in the market, we continue to grow QSR market share.  Moving to the US. We posted positive comps across all dayparts in the second quarter, led by breakfast. Overall comp sales were up nearly 4% due to higher average check supported by strategic price increases. We continue to focus on everyday affordability that customers are looking for, across both our everyday value menu and digital offerings.  Turning to the international developmental license markets. Comp sales were up 16% in the quarter, largely driven by strong comps in Japan and Latin America. Japan achieved an impressive 27th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales with strength across our delivery and digital channels and our growth at the dinner daypart continued with popular limited time offerings across both chicken and beef.  Recovery in China remains challenged with negative double-digit comp sales in the second quarter due to ongoing COVID resurgences and related lockdowns across key cities. This resulted in temporary restaurant closures throughout the country for most of the quarter. While operating conditions are challenging, restaurants remained focused on the consumer, offering core menu favorites and targeted digital coupons.  And now I'll turn it back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, Kevin. McDonald's is one of the most recognized and beloved brands on earth. Today, our opportunity is building on this recognition to keep up with customers and communities around the world and on every platform, whether it's our global mobile app or social media. I'm proud of McDonald's industry-leading digital and marketing initiatives that allow us to connect with even more customers in entirely new and creative ways, so we can strengthen our relationships, better connected culture and meet customers where they are.  The investments we're making in digital, one of our biggest opportunities for growth, are beginning to bear fruit. In our top six markets, digital sales, which include mobile app, kiosk and delivery, represented over $6 billion or nearly 1/3 of system-wide sales in the second quarter. With the launch of MyMcDonald's Rewards in the UK this month, we now have loyalty programs in nearly 50 markets, including all of our top six markets, enrollment and participation continue to grow. And our loyal customers are highly engaged with us. Nearly 22 million of US loyalty members have been active in the last 90 days. MyMcDonald's Rewards has consistently driven more frequent visits and incremental sales in each of the markets as we've launched. Each reward a customer redeems and each preference a customer shares helps us power our personal touch. We can use this deeper understanding of our customers to create content and offers relevant to them through the channels they prefer. By tailoring messages, our customers feel more connected to McDonald's, ultimately driving engagement that increases both spend and frequency. It even means we can reunite with customers who haven't visited us in a while. We're also strengthening our iconic core menu. As I've mentioned before, in markets around the world, we're taking our leading burgers and making them even better by implementing enhanced cooking procedures and new buns, resulting in hotter, juicier and tastier burgers. Spain was the latest market to launch these taste and quality improvements, driving incremental sales and giving our customers yet another reason to keep coming back for more. We'll also keep coming up with fresh spins in our classics, creating craveable moments for a new generation of McDonald's fans. In Germany, strong marketing and core menu campaigns, including the Big Mac celebration featuring double Big Mac drove strong comps for the quarter. In Australia, we leveraged the strength of our McCafe brand with the launch of the Australiano coffee in the second quarter and continue to grow our share in coffee. Of course, there's no better example of combining classic with modern relevance than our transformational marketing. And that's not just my opinion, it's the consensus of the marketing industry. McDonald's was repeatedly recognized this quarter for advertising that captures both hearts and minds. At the Cannes Lions last month, McDonald's and its marketing partners received multiple awards, while simultaneously being named the most effective brand on the WARC Effective 100 for the third year running. We swept the global FE [ph] awards and were recognized as the number one most effective brand and marketer the US. Over the past few months, we've continued to turn cultural moments into creative pedicles for the Golden Arches. In May, McDonald's commemorated Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee by recording a new version of our world famous I'm Lovin It jingle, making headlines and history. As Kevin mentioned, Australia launched our latest famous order with pop phenom The Kid LAROI. And we created a significant brand moment in Canada with our annual McHappy Day campaign, raising nearly $6 million for Ronald McDonald House Charities and lifting sales and brand perceptions in the process. Our creative excellence has expanded our reach and made McDonald's not just more recognizable, but more relevant. And it's this customer connection that is continuing to drive our business in new and exciting ways. Now to talk more about our second quarter financial performance, I'll hand it back to Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks, Chris. Our strong top line performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $2.55, an increase of 15% in constant currencies. This adjusted EPS excludes $1.2 billion of charges related to our exit from Russia and a gain of $270 million from the sale of Dynamic Yield. Adjusted EPS was hurt by $0.16 of currency as the dollar strengthened significantly in the second quarter. That was double the amount we estimated in our first quarter earnings call based on exchange rates at that time.  Our G&A costs increased 10% in constant currencies for the quarter, reflecting higher investments in restaurant technology and incremental expenses related to our worldwide convention and proxy contest. As expected, company-operated margins were hampered by significant commodity and wage inflation as well as rising energy costs.  Given macroeconomic conditions, we expect these inflationary pressures will continue to impact margins for the remainder of the year. Our company-operated margin dollars for the quarter were also negatively impacted by our exit from Russia, which was a heavily company-owned market. Even with these cost headwinds and our exit from Russia, our strong system-wide sales growth contributed to healthy flow-through to operating income.  Total restaurant margin dollars grew $270 million in constant currency, as a result of sales-driven growth in franchise margins, which now make up nearly 90% of restaurant margin dollars. This resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 45% for the quarter.  Lastly, based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce third quarter EPS by about $0.14 to $0.16 and full year EPS by roughly $0.40 to $0.50 again, double the impact that we estimated on our first quarter call. As we certainly saw last quarter, this is directional guidance only, as rates will likely fluctuate as we move through the year.  Before I pass it back to Chris, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It's been an absolute privilege to serve as CFO of this iconic brand for over seven years. During this time, I've met many people who are on the call this morning from analysts who follow our industry, to investors in our company. I've had a lot of thought-provoking conversations with many of you.  You offered your opinions and challenged me and my interactions with you over the years helped make me a better CFO and helped make McDonald's a better company. I'm extremely grateful for your engagement through the years and for the confidence you placed in us with your investments. I look forward to passing the baton to Ian Borden who I worked closely with on our senior leadership team for many years. We will continue to work together to ensure a smooth transition.  Thank you again. And now back to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Kevin. As we reflect on these results for the second quarter, I feel tremendous pride in the entire McDonald's system. I believe there has never been a better time to be part of the McDonald's brand. We have the right leadership and the right strategy at exactly the right time to take this iconic brand to even greater heights. As we announced over the past few weeks, we continue to assemble the right members of our global senior leadership team to help lead the next chapter for brand McDonald's, building on the success is made because of the outstanding contributions of former leaders.  Because of McDonald's ability to provide a variety of opportunities and experiences at one of the world's most recognized and respected brands, our ability to recruit top talent and develop a deep bench is unparalleled in our industry. This only builds our confidence in executing on our strategic plan for the long term. As Kevin mentioned, stepping into the CFO role next is 30-year McDonald's veteran Ian Borden. Currently President of International, Ian has worked literally around the world for McDonald's in a variety of capacities. He brings a great mix of financial and field experience into the CFO role, and it will be great to have him now based in our Chicago headquarters. Additionally, Jill McDonald will be returning to McDonald's as President of our International Operated Market. Jill began her career as a marker, eventually leading global marketing at British Airways. Jill then joined McDonald's as Chief Marketing Officer for our UK business in Northern Europe and later became the Managing Director for our UK business and President of Northern Europe. Jill is a seasoned veteran of the consumer industry, having served most recently as CEO of Costa Coffee. Her strong customer focus, passion for creative excellence, and commitment to innovation align well with my priorities, and I'm confident Jill will help accelerate the next phase of the IOM segment's growth. I'm also happy to share that Jo Sempels will continue to lead our international developmental license markets as President of IDO. Jo\u2019s responsibilities will now include our large, fast-growing China business, which currently reports to Ian in his capacity as President of International. Meanwhile, Francesca DeBiase will be retiring as Global Chief Supply Chain Officer after more than three decades at McDonald's and over seven years in this role. I'm especially grateful to Francesca for stewarding our world-class supply chain through unprecedented disruptions and for spearheading sustainable solutions that are now standard practice throughout our system. While we'll miss Francesca, we're happy that Marion Gross will now be stepping into this role. Marion has been with McDonald's for 29 years, most recently as Chief Supply Chain Officer of McDonald's North America. I'm lucky to be surrounded by such great leaders who are also such good people. That's what McDonald's is all about, which is why we call ourselves the McFamily. With that, let's begin Q&A.\nA - Mike Cieplak: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. First, I wanted to congratulate Kevin on a great career. You'll be missed by the investment community. And then, secondly, I guess, Chris, I wanted to ask about the situation in Europe, specifically again. And I know you called out a lot of macro challenges. And I was just wondering if you could comment specifically on whether you're starting to see any consumer behavior changes in your European business as a result of some of those pressures? And then I guess relatedly, you mentioned that you're planning for a lot of scenarios, and I was wondering if you could comment on what McDonald's might do if we were to see a more material downturn in consumer spending. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, David. Well, as you saw in the announcement, we continue to have broad-based growth in, and our European business overall is performing quite well. I'm actually very happy with how the European business is performing. There's a few things that we're seeing consistently across that we are seeing, that we're gaining traffic and comp sales share in every market -- major market where we operate, we feel great about that. We're gaining share in beef and chicken, which were priority areas for us. And we're doing quite well in delivery. And I expect digital, particularly as we bring on the UK, is going to be a performer for us. So headline is, Europe is doing very well for us. I think what is weighing on our mind and we're certainly attentive to is, consumer sentiment as one area and a number of markets in Europe, France, as an example, Germany is another market. Spain is another market we're seeing consumer sentiment down, and in many cases, down at record levels. So that's one area of concern.  The second is, we do know that the inflationary pressures in Europe are elevated even beyond what we're seeing here in the US, and that has an impact on sentiment, but that also has an impact on what we're needing to do from a menu board standpoint and pricing. And so, I think while we look at Europe right now, and we're seeing strong results, it is a challenging situation. It's challenging for our franchisees. And as you think about what we plan for under a variety of scenarios, it goes to essentially what are our marketing levers and what are our investment scenarios. And do we need to lean into harder, for example, the value end of our menu platform, that could be one scenario.  On the other hand, if it continues at its current pace, maybe we don't need to lean in as hard as that. So, these are things that happen at a market level on a country-by-country basis, but I think the way our teams are looking at it is because of this uncertainty around consumer sentiment, we're just having to plan for more different scenarios and that means having more flexibility in the marketing calendar to pivot, if need be.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks, good morning and Kevin, let me just add my congratulations and best wishes as well. My question is similar, but to the US. Last quarter, you talked about a little bit of trade down in the US as maybe early evidence the consumer is changing. Where does that stand now? And what is the conversation now about pricing with the franchisees? Pricing has been used, obviously, to cover inflation, but maybe is there -- are you coaching them now to be easier on that factor, just given the changing dynamics in the US, how do you view pricing today versus maybe 90 days ago?\nChris Kempczinski: Why don't I have Kevin hit this at the top, and then I'll cover anything he misses.\nKevin Ozan: Yes, I can take it. And thanks, David and John for your kind comments. Let me talk about the US and the comp and what drove the comp, and I think that will help talk about some of the trade down that you're talking about. Our Q2 comp of a little under 4, was driven completely by higher average check. Our guest counts were relatively flat. So, it really was check driven. And that average check was driven obviously, mainly by price increases.  Year-over-year in the second quarter, our menu prices were up high single digits, relatively consistent with what I talked about in the first quarter, a little bit higher than that. And we expect for the year to be in that high single-digit range for the full year. What we are seeing still is, flow through it similar to what we've seen historically, still strong flow-through of roughly 70% or so.  So, if you think about an 8%, 9% price increase with a 70% flow-through, the difference between that and our comp of a little under 4% was driven by 2 main things. First, one of the things I started talking about in the first quarter was a decline in units per transaction, that's partly driven by a reversion in the number of people per transaction.  You'll recall during COVID, what happened is, we had a significant shift in channels from front counter to things like delivery and drive-through and that increased the number of people per order. What we're now seeing in the US but also around the world is a little bit back to some normal channels as restaurants open up. So delivery is still a little bit elevated versus where it was pre-COVID, but drive-through percentages are pretty much back to where they were pre-COVID. So we're seeing a number of people per transaction go down. We knew that would happen at some point, we didn't exactly know timing. The other thing to a lesser extent, and again, I mentioned last quarter is that we are seeing some trade down. We're seeing customers and specifically lower income customers, trade down to value offerings and fewer combo meals. So those dynamics are kind of what's driving both the comp and our pricing. We do, as we've talked about historically -- we do work closely with our franchisees on pricing. We use a third-party adviser that advises the franchisees as well as the company on pricing. It's a consumer-based research approach. And I've talked before about specifically this year, how we're taking smaller, more frequent price increases, because it gives us the flexibility to be able to see how consumers are reacting and then adjust if or when necessary. One of the most important things that we keep an eye on is, obviously, there are cost pressures, both on the commodity and labor side, but we have to balance that with continuing to provide value for our customers. And there's a couple of key metrics that we look at. One called good value for money, which is one of the customer scores we look at. And another is affordable options that I like. And we still continue to do well on those metrics which is the most important thing to make sure that our customer still are perceiving our offerings as value.\nChris Kempczinski: The only thing I would add to what Kevin said is, we track as many of you do as well, food at home versus food away from home. And right now, we're seeing a significant gap. In fact, we think, by our measure, it's the largest gap we've ever seen and -- well, is seen in 50 years between food at home and food away from home, meaning that food at home has increased pricing significantly faster than what food away from home, McDonald's and others in our industry have done. I don't know what the impact of that is. But certainly, we expect that there is some benefit that we're seeing as part of that. And the other thing I would just add is Kevin's comment about looking at good value for money. We look at that around the world. One of the things that makes me feel confident is, in almost every major market where we operate, there's just two exceptions: China and Spain. But in every other market where we operate, we are leading amongst any of our peers from that, for a value for money standpoint. So we're still -- even though we're pushing through pricing, the consumer is tolerating it well, and we're still doing very well from a value score standpoint.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. And, Kevin, congrats on a very successful tenure as CFO and best of luck to you and Ian in your new roles. My question for you, Kevin, is just around modeling the IOM segment. Can you help us think through what is a fair segment EBIT dollar embedded in your guidance, just given the many moving pieces of the Russia sale and the company operated Ukraine market that's still largely closed on a temporary basis, that's just making this a very difficult segment to model?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Let me give you a perspective on Russia. They were in our comp through first quarter and then they wouldn't be in our results or comp beginning second quarter. Russia represented roughly 2% of system-wide sales, about 7% of revenue and about 2% of operating income. So, if you use that for modeling purposes, that should get you kind of to hopefully, the adjusted numbers that should be representative of our trends going forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Kevin, congratulations on your career at McDonald's. Just a follow-up for you on pricing and inflation. Could you talk about inflation relative to pricing in the US and IOM in the quarter and how you see that gap progressing through the year to the degree that it might be closing that would be interesting. And I sense that, that gap is relatively larger for IOM than it is in the US? And then, Chris, if I could just squeeze one more in. I'd just love to get your take about aside from getting ready for the need for value. What are the biggest improvement areas for the company that you see on the horizon kind of thinking out a couple of years? You've teased out things like menu with chicken and beverage and technology benefits in CRM and the operations, but I'd love to get your sense about what's most important on the horizon? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Okay, you go Kevin.\nKevin Ozan: I'll start with the inflation and then we'll go back to Chris on your second question. So let me give a perspective. Right now, second quarter year-over-year in the US, food and paper inflation -- well, let me talk about it this way. For the full year in the US, we expect roughly 12% to 14% inflation. It's a little higher than that in the second quarter, likely a little higher than that in the third quarter. And then we expect to see it to moderate some in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that's based on what we know today. That's on food and paper.  On the labor side, we're probably seeing a little over 10% labor inflation right now. Part of that is, we had strategic wage rate increases in our company-operated restaurants kind of mid last year. So, we won't start lapping those until the second half of the year. So more of that inflation was hit in the first half of the year than the second.  To your point on the international side, right now, the range is probably similar on average, the 12% to 14% for the year, but a couple of things there. One, we're probably at the higher end of that range on the international side. Two, there's probably a wider range of scenarios like Chris talked about. And three, different than the US, we don't see that moderating. Their increases will actually likely be higher in the third and fourth quarter than they were in the first and second quarter. So, to your point, Europe is getting hit harder on the inflation, certainly on the food and paper. The other thing I would just say, it certainly varies by country. You have some countries that are getting hit dramatically by energy prices based on kind of Russian oil, etcetera. And so, it really is a country-by-country dynamic. But in general, the international side will get hit a little bit harder than the US and it will last a little bit longer later in the year than the US right now.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. To answer your second question in terms of what I think are the biggest priorities over the next few years, if I use our MCD framework under Accelerating the Arches and start with the M, I think we have an opportunity to continue to improve on the marketing front and just get more consistently excellent around the world from a creative standpoint. Jill McDonald is going to be a part of helping to do that. I think we've made a lot of progress in the US. I think there are still opportunities for us to improve our creative in some of our international markets. So that's one area. Second is, as you move to the scene and core menu chicken, for us continues to be, I think, a significant opportunity for us to improve our chicken portfolio. And we've got some great global equities already in our McNuggets and with McChicken, but we also have some equities in McCrispy and McSpicy that we think we've got an opportunity to do more with globally. So that's going to be a priority area. And then digital. And we talked about digital being a multi-year journey, but I'm incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing in digital. Just to give you a sense of what I think the opportunity is, if you look at Germany, France, UK, China, I mean, digital is over half of the sales in those markets. In the case of China, it's over 80% of the sales in those markets. Compare that to the US, compare that to Canada where it's maybe a-quarter of the sales. So there's a big opportunity for us in North America to increase digital as a percent of sales. And then what happens when you do that is, your percent of identified customers goes up very dramatically. And that opens up a whole range of things from service opportunities, pricing opportunities, et cetera. So I think digital for us is, we're starting to see the benefits. We just need to go harder and faster against that. And we have a few other ideas. Part of what I wanted Kevin to help me with in this next phase, his next role that he's going to be in is, just working through a few other ideas that we think might put a little top spin on the plan. So we'll come back at some point later and talk about that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. And, Kevin, congratulations and best of luck, of course. Chris, you talked about a bunch of the strategic opportunities in Europe that you and the team are looking at. Curious if most of the levers that you mentioned are kind of similar to the US in thinking about how you navigate some of the challenges and plan for different scenarios. Or are there differences in the US in how you're thinking about navigating US macro challenges? And if so, could you touch on some of those at all.\nChris Kempczinski: I think there's probably more consistency than not. And when I think about Europe, one of the things that we're seeing in Europe is we're seeing that, that was a business that was largely a dine-in business that through COVID, we are seeing that the dining or takeaway portion of the business continues to be elevated. And we're seeing a much greater traction on digital as being one of our service channels there. That, I think, creates some opportunities for us that we need to get after that are probably different than what you would see in the US, because the US has always been more of a takeaway market. But what does that mean for Europe? So that's one area for us that I think we've got more to do in that. I think -- when we look also at what's going on in Europe, we've got a very strong coffee business in a number of markets, and I think driving that and using that particularly as a way to drive transactions, I think that's also an opportunity for us. The other thing that Europe is focused on like chicken as an example, those tend to be more consistent. If you move over to the US, I mean, the US team has done a great job over the last several years and it's shown up in a strong multiyear run in comp sales. So, I think a lot of what is currently in flight in the US is just continuing to do that. And I've talked about it in a number of different occasions and was in our press release around this. It's execution, execution, execution.  And part of that means that we need to make sure that our restaurants are properly staffed. It needs to make sure that we're getting our crude trained and make sure that we are operationally, delivering on things like service times that we know can have a big impact on customer satisfaction. So those are the priorities for Jill and the team in the US.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. And Kevin, I also echo my congrats. A follow-up on the value commentary. Can you expand on how you're thinking about everyday value and balancing the elevated cost in the US, whether that's dollar drinks or $1, $2, $3 menu. I guess what's the franchisee appetite for value, should we see a more challenging environment? And then related, you offer an array of promos to the app. How do you think about your composition of value offers as it relates to digital versus in-store? Are we getting to a point where personalization might be something on the horizon? Thank you. \nChris Kempczinski: Yes. So, when you think about value, I think you touched on a number of things here, which is you have to think about value in a very targeted way. And there are different products with different elasticities in different geographies. I think a thing that I get excited about, particularly as we move more of the business to digital is the ability for us to be much more targeted in how and where we deliver that value.  So in the past, go back maybe 10 years ago, we didn't have the ability to deliver that sort of precision value and you would end up having kind of a national deal that would hit everybody. But we know that that's going to -- that there's a lot of waste in that, that there are people that are delivering value to under that scenario who probably would have still bought without it.  So, what we're looking at doing and with the US team, along with our pricing advisers is exactly which products on the menu do you need to offer value to what degree and then what through what vehicle? Is it through an offer, is it through a menu price adjustment, or is it through some sort of promo that you do?  So, it ends up being a much more nuanced way that we're able to look at value, but I think part of being more nuanced and it is, is how we're able to push through this pricing without seeing a big falloff in the pass-through numbers that Kevin was talking about. So, it's tough to talk about value these days in kind of a one-size-fits-all approach because the beauty of, I think, what we're transitioning to is a much more targeted tailored approach to our value. But Kevin, I'll let you pick up on that.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'd add is, just to demonstrate what Chris was talking about, if you think about this transition or evolution, historically, we would have had a big national value menu. Today, value is primarily driven at a local level, specifically at the breakfast daypart. So, we do have a $1, $2, $3 nationally advertised value platform, but it's really complemented with a localized approach that allows the individual field offices to promote products that make sense in their local markets and based on their competitive set.  We'll continue to have some national programs, whether it's two for $6 or a buy one get one, but we've moved really more to a local approach, which then becomes ultimately a personalized approach, as Chris talked about. So we're in the middle of that evolution going from national to local to ultimately really more personalized.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to get back to the comment on labor. And if you think the stores, and this is both US and IOM, are staffed to the extent that you can properly meet demand? In other words, do you have unmet demand that's in the system because of your staffing levels at the store. And if that is the case, I mean, are there any capital or technology type of investments in coming years that could allow you to reduce your demand for labor while increasing overall customer service. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, if I start with -- and I'll just use US as an example, I mean, McOpCo is showing the way on how to do this. Our McOpCo business in the US is over -- it's outperforming our US average. And if you look at the McOpCo business, despite all the challenges, they are at sort of our target roster sizes and they're seeing speed of service improvements that are ultimately driving customer satisfaction. So we know from our McOpCo business that it is possible to do it. It's not easy. It takes a lot of work, but it is possible for us to get after that. The people are out there and part of why we put in the EVP program that the US team did, is to make sure that we're able to talk more consistently as an employer to get people to come into our restaurants. So headline is, we do think we've got a formula and a playbook that, if deployed, can ensure that we've got our restaurants properly staffed. And like I said, McOpCo is a great example of that. Thinking about longer term, there's a lot of interest around what can you do from an automation standpoint? I've talked about it in the past. We've spent a lot of time, money, effort, looking at this, and there is not going to be a silver bullet that goes and addresses this for the industry. The idea of robots and all those things, while it maybe is great for garnering headlines, it's not practical in the vast majority of restaurants. The economics don't pencil out, you don't necessarily have the footprint. And there's a lot of infrastructure investments that you need to do around your utility, around your HVAC systems. You're not going to see that as a broad-based solution anytime soon. There are things that you can do around systems and technology, especially taking advantage of all of this data that you're collecting around customers that I think can make the job easier, things like scheduling, as an example, ordering as another example that will ultimately help reduce some of the labor demand in the restaurant. But I think your question was, is there a big automation solution, and you're not going to see, like I said, robots in the restaurant. We've got to kind of get after this the old-fashioned way, which is just making sure we're a great employer and offering our crew a great experience when they come into the restaurants.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. And, Kevin, congrats on the uptime moves and ultimate retirement. I had a bigger picture question just on franchise relations. Chris, I know you mentioned McFamily in your closing remarks, and it seems like its ongoing balancing act, considering the very strong performance through the pandemic. I know you mentioned franchise profits at a lot time highs to close last year. And now, obviously, seemingly some pressures to profitability and there's more headlines in the press on changes in contracts and some frustrations from the franchisee side. So just trying to get a sense for whether you think there's been any change in how you think about the relations? And as it relates to that, just because China is a big franchise market, is there any reason for concern on your end on the underlying fundamentals of the business? So do you really think it's purely COVID and therefore the recovery will follow suit as COVID concerns ease? Thank you. \nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me start with that at a macro level. We have about 5,000 franchisees globally. And so, when you think about franchisees and I've talked about this in the past, it's hard to talk about them as one group of franchisees because we have, like I said, 5,000 franchisees of different sizes of different constructs, etcetera around the world.  Think, if I get underneath your question, you're probably asking about some of the headlines that have occurred in the US of late. And I would just point out a couple of things. Our aspiration as McDonald's, frankly, one of the things that we pride ourselves on, we absolutely believe that we're the best franchisor in our industry. And we think we've demonstrated that over the last 70-plus years.  We only get to say that, if you continue to have the best franchisees. And the moves that the team announced in the US are designed to ensure we continue to have the best franchisees in our industry, which then makes us the best franchise or and the way that they're going about it is two ways. They're going about it in some areas, raising standards. And in other areas, improving access for people who want to join our system.  And I would say that the announcement that the US team made recently, it connects to an earlier announcement that we made that I think maybe many of you had saw, which was our commitment to put $250 million into financing options to be able to continue to attract new people to become franchisees, many of whom we hope, our crew working in our restaurants to then become franchisees.  So, everything that was announced is about for us continuing to make sure that we are going to be the best place for the best franchisees. You only get to make those announcements in my view when you're doing it from a position of strength. And that's what we've got in the US right now, earned over the last several years through our performance.  And the position -- what it's given us is, it's given us a very nice situation where the demand for our restaurants significantly outstrips the supply [ph]. If you get our current franchisees, the vast majority of our current franchisees are continuing to look for ways to grow their organizations by buying new restaurants and they're also looking for ways for their children to continue to run and continue in the system. That's a good thing.  At the same time, we've got strong external demand, especially with the support on financing for people who want to come into our system and become franchisees. So, from my vantage point, I'm excited when I see demand for our restaurants outstrip the supply. I think that makes us a better business. There are people that are exiting the system that's been written about as well.  I would say, what they're doing at this point is they're taking advantage of the strong health of the business to get multiples of 8-to-10x when they're selling, which is the best that we've seen in, I think, anybody's recent memory on this. So, there are some people looking at taking money off the table right now, but they're doing it at incredibly multiples. If you step back on this and think about it again, I'm talking more about the US, but everything that we've announced, if you are a strong performing franchisee, you're going to be excited about this because what it means is that you're going to continue to have the opportunity to grow, and you're going to have stability around your equity. I think where there is concern is if you are maybe not one of our stronger performing franchisees, this probably does some of the announcements that the team made probably does raise your concern. But the US team, I know, is committed to helping improve there and I would be delighted to see that if we can get improvement in maybe some of the lower-performing franchisees. But broadly, I would say our relations with our franchisees globally, the 5,000 franchisees is strong. And when we're a great franchise, when we're great franchisees, this business tends to do pretty well over time.\nKevin Ozan: And then on China, your question related to China. I think we still believe there's huge opportunity in China. We're still committed to our China business. They certainly have had a rough couple of years with all of the stops and starts with COVID, but we still expect to open roughly 800 restaurants this year. And hopefully, the economic environment can get back there to something relatively normal because we're still big believers in the opportunity in China and have a lot of confidence in our business there. .\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. And of course, congratulations to everyone on their new roles, and it's great to see Jill coming back in excellent re-addition. But I had two questions there about the outlook. The first is just unit growth in the US coming in slightly lower into the previous range. Is that because of challenges in the supply chain, and we hear about constraints around equipment or labor and staffing. It doesn't seem like it's an access to capital issue given the multiples that are historically high. And then also on the guidance, you talked about mid-40s operating margin, again, also slightly higher than the prior. Is it a function of mix? Like less company-operated or better topline? Because again, we're seeing costs coming very high. So, just trying to understand those relatively minor changes, please?\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Thanks Sara. Let me take a shot at both of those. On the unit growth in the US, you're right, it's come down a little bit. that's mainly due to timing. Some permitting is taking a little bit longer in some areas. We do still expect net unit growth in the US this year for the first time in several years, but it's certainly not an access to capital, as you mentioned. It really is just a timing thing. And we are finding that openings are taking a little bit longer between some supply chain challenges and some permitting just timeframes. I think there's a backload making just getting through all the government processes take a little longer. On operating margin, we upped that guidance a little bit right after the Russia announcement. It really is a function primarily of selling our Russia business. The Russia business, as you know, was primarily company-owned and actually had an operating margin below our global average. So, by taking them out now actually helped improve the operating margin. So, it is just a function of mix in the near-term. We do still believe that longer term, there's leverage to be gained both in operating margin and specifically on the G&A side that should help that operating margin longer term, not in 2022, but longer term that should help improve that operating margin going forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just sort of two for me. I'm curious on daypart, if you're seeing any shift in daypart usage across the US system. I know you talked about some maybe some easing on the lower income side of the consumer, but wondering if you're seeing anything specific to any of the dayparts, whether that's breakfast, lunch, diner or late night that you'd like to call out. And then I also wanted to know if you could help quantify or provide some incremental color on the gains that you're seeing either on average check or frequency from the loyalty program now that we've effectively launched one year past the launch in the -- or last one year since the launch in the US. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: I'll start with daypart and then let Kevin address any check commentary that we want to do around loyalty. But the great thing, I think, about the US performance is, the growth that they're seeing is broad-based. It's across all day parts. And in fact, breakfast was the strongest performing daypart in the US comp, which we feel good about. It's a change. If you remember, a few years ago, I think there were a bunch of questions about breakfast. If you also sort of zoom out and you look at our performance, our daypart performance on a three-year stack in the US, incredibly consistent US, breakfast, lunch, dinner, are both north of 20% that we saw with a three-year stack from a daypart standpoint. Late night being the one area that we saw a significant impact over the last three years. So I would say, generally, we feel very good about the balance that we're seeing from a daypart standpoint and probably not, any noteworthy color that I would offer around differences by daypart. Kevin, I'll let you handle the loyalty question.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. I mean, loyalty is an interesting dynamic related to check. Loyalty is really about driving frequency and increasing frequency. And we are seeing definite increases in frequency everywhere where loyalty has gone in. If you take into account redemptions on the loyalty, you actually see a little bit lower average check because of the redemptions that occur there. But it is significantly driving frequency. So when you look at it in total, it's clearly additive to sales. But if you just look at an actual average check and take into account redemptions, you end up with a little bit lower check because of that.\nMike Cieplak: As we near the bottom of the hour, we have time for one more question from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you so much. Good morning. In the US, can you talk a little bit -- finished up the conversation essentially just having about cohorts. Can you do that a little bit by income? So let's say, the lower income you said a few times now is coming a little bit less. How much less does that matter? So by cohort of income, who comes the most or spends the most, such that we can't really understand when you're saying they come less. Like what is the impact of that, if that makes sense?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. I know the question. I don't have the degree of precision on the data that I think you're looking for. But I would say, generally, what we know is -- happening is that there is challenge on the lower income, but that we are getting trade down out of things like full-service restaurants, getting trade down at a fast casual that's helping offset any of that impact. Net-net, what we saw in 2008, 2009 and what we expect is going to continue is that we're going to be a net beneficiary on all of that. That's our planning expectation is that while there is going to be some shifting within the cohort or you describe it, net-net, our value positioning, our value scores, we expect to be a winner out of all of that.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Kevin. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation's Investor Call.

Today's call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks Mike, and good morning, everyone. A few weeks ago I had the privilege of welcoming more than 13,000 members of global McDonald's family, franchisees, restaurant teams, suppliers and company employees to our first in-person worldwide convention in four years. The sense of optimism and pride in our brand coupled with excitement for our future was overwhelming. We celebrated how far we've come together and united around how much further we can go together in the years ahead. Through it all, the message has been singular and clear there has never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's. This was reaffirmed on our road to convention as our senior leadership team participated in a series of market visits to meet with and hear from restaurant teams in person. I look forward to continuing to visit more teams around the world in the coming months to see how they are bringing our strategy to life in our restaurants. McDonald's entered 2022 from a position of strength and I'm proud to share that we built on that momentum in Q1. Though we continue to monitor the latest developments on the pandemic, we've been pleased to see strong recovery in international markets in the first quarter. In fact in an increasingly complex and unpredictable external environment, the past few years have demonstrated the resiliency of the McDonald's brand and our ability to drive historic growth. We believe we're well-positioned to weather unprecedented macro pressures like inflation, supply chain issues, labor availability and COVID resurgences. There is power in dialing up our execution and focusing on what's within our control during challenging times to maximize the impact of our strategic plan. Staying on the side of the consumer and executing our plan is and has always been our model for driving growth regardless of the macro backdrop. Equally as important is our ongoing commitment to invest in our people. It starts with building a culture of care. The more we show restaurant teams we care, the more they show the same care for our customers. By creating the type of environment where people want to work whether they're looking to develop skills that they can take to future jobs or planning to build a career with us, McDonald's provides a holistic employee value proposition. In turn our people enable us to deliver an unequaled customer experience, backed by the power of our brand. This is our winning formula. It's a formula we will continue to protect, especially as we work to raise our ambition and create the next great chapter of this legendary brand together. Before I turn it over to Kevin, I do want to acknowledge that our hearts and minds are with the Ukrainian people and all who have been impacted by this historic crisis that has brought new elements of uncertainty to communities around the world. Our restaurants in Ukraine and in Russia remain closed. In both countries, we have continued to pay employees and provide additional support to them and others in need. But it's clear, that this crisis is far from over. With an ever-evolving situation, we are analyzing our options and expect to provide clear direction to investors and other stakeholders no later than the end of the second quarter. Now over to Kevin to, walk us through our Q1 performance.\nKevin Ozan: Thanks Chris. Global comp sales were up nearly 12% in the first quarter, reflecting strong underlying performance across all segments. In most of our major markets we sustained QSR traffic share gains by elevating our brand, accelerating digital channels and showcasing our core equities of chicken and beef. We entered 2022 expecting it to be a year of continued recovery in our international-operated markets, as several markets were still experiencing COVID-related stops and starts throughout 2021. In the first quarter, comp sales in our IOM segment increased over 20% and average unit volumes have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels across the segment. The U.K. continues to be one of our strongest performing markets. In the first quarter performance in the U.K. was fueled by sustained digital momentum and strong menu initiatives like the national rollout of McPlant and the extremely successful Chicken Big Mac promotion. In Australia, the Welcome to My World convenience campaign showcased how we make consumers' lives easier and helped drive significant share gains in delivery. And the launch of MyMcDonald's Rewards in March has already increased app adoption among consumers. Canada also experienced strong digital growth building on their successful fourth quarter launch of Loyalty. Over the past couple of years, consumer mobility was particularly challenged in France and Germany, but we saw great improvement in both markets throughout the quarter. We highlighted our core menu in both markets, with a successful QPC campaign in France and the launch of our new premium beef platform McDonald's Supreme, in Germany. As Chris mentioned, the quarter also brought more macroeconomic challenges including rising inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, all of which were elevated by the crisis in Ukraine. All of our restaurants in Ukraine were closed at the end of February. And in early March we made the decision to suspend operations in Russia. While these markets represented about 2% of system-wide sales in 2021, the closures had a negligible impact on consolidated sales results for the first quarter this year. In the U.S., comp sales were 3.5% for the first quarter. Higher average check driven by strategic price increases continued to be a significant growth driver and strong marketing campaigns across loyalty, value bundles and our Crispy Chicken Sandwich delivered incremental sales and continued to drive digital adoption. Turning to the international developmental license markets. Comp sales were up nearly 15% for the quarter largely driven by positive comps in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. In Japan, we focused on off-premise channels as a result of elevated COVID levels, meeting shifting consumer needs and continuing to grow market share. We also delivered strong growth at the dinner daypart with limited time offerings like the re-hit of the Samurai Mac and the launch of Spicy Chicken Nuggets. And in China, a surge in COVID cases and renewed government restrictions created challenging operating conditions in the quarter, resulting in temporary restaurant closures throughout the country that continue today. While comps were negative for the quarter, we expanded our app engagement with digital-only promotions including delivery offers and subscription cards. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris. \nChris Kempczinski: Thanks Kevin. Back in 2020, we took a hard look at changing customer needs we were seeing emerging through the pandemic. Those insights led us to our Accelerating the Arches strategic plan and a focus on the MCDs, maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu and doubling down on the 3Ds digital, delivery and drive-thru. The power of the MCDs are when they work together with the customer at the center. By doubling down on our 3Ds digital, delivery and drive-thru, we continue to find new ways to reach our customers where they are and make their experience more seamless and personalized. Digital in particular is a tremendous opportunity for us. After all in a world where the store front of McDonald's restaurant can be the screen of a smartphone, we're building stronger relationships with our customers. Knowing what they like, how they like it, when they want it, it's all a critical piece of our digital strategy, and the results of our efforts speak for themselves. In our top six markets, digital sales, which include mobile application, kiosks and delivery made up more than 30% of system-wide sales in the first quarter. This equates to nearly 60% growth over the past year. We did over $2 billion of digital sales in the U.S. alone in the first quarter. One of the biggest drivers of our digital adoption is our global loyalty program MyMcDonald's Rewards. It's helping us better meet our customers' needs as we build more authentic and personal relationships. Coming into this year, we had introduced MyMcDonald's Rewards in over 40 markets, including France, the U.S., Germany and Canada. Australia just launched in March, and the U.K. will go live later this year. Enrollment and participation are exceeding expectations. After just nine months in the U.S. for instance, there are more than 26 million loyalty members earning rewards. We're also seeing more frequent visits from loyalty customers, many of whom were very loyal to begin with. Some of our largest markets have seen record customer visit frequency driven by loyalty usage coupled with app exclusive promotions. Those are the kind of results that make us eager to continue bringing MyMcDonald's Rewards to even more markets. And as customers return to our dining rooms kiosk usage is coming back as a key order channel for customers. In Q1, kiosk sales made up more than half of in-restaurant sales in Australia, Germany, France and the U.K. At the same time, McDelivery has become the largest QSR delivery program in the world. We recently announced a global partnership with Just Eat Takeaway, Europe's largest online restaurant ordering service. This is in addition to the Uber Eats and DoorDash global partnerships we announced last year. These global partnerships support growth of the McDelivery business and allow us to continue expanding our delivery capabilities so our customers can get the food they crave and the convenience they become accustomed to. In the UK, our customers can now order delivery directly on the McDonald's app. We plan to expand that capability to the US, Canada and Australia later this year. This will let us better control the delivery experience for our most loyal customers and to learn from the data they share ultimately about how we create more seamless memorable and personalized experiences. Finally, the competitive strength of our 25,000-plus drive-thru locations around the world continues to provide unparalleled convenience to our customers as routines are reestablished with further opportunities to innovate. And because of our iconic brand, we're building customer affinity by elevating our creative risk-taking and social media to enhance our already strong connections to customers. Fan Truth unlocked this powerful connection. It created a common dialogue tapping into what our fans already love about us celebrating the rituals and memories that make our brand so special to them. The US first brought this to life with Famous Orders which harnessed the simple truth that everyone has their go-to order. This quarter the menu hacks promotion and our Super Bowl commercial were prime examples of how we can find and identify Fan Truth and transform something people already love our food into cultural moments to drive conversation and connection. And because these promotions feature existing core menu items there's no added complexity to restaurant operations.  The concept of Fan Truth is coming to life all over the world. This quarter China successfully activated the Famous Orders platform with their own local celebrity featuring the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich. And Australia plans to launch their own Famous Order in the second quarter. Our food is at the heart of customers' relationship with our brand. In fact our core menu accounts for the large majority of our business and our growth. That's why we continue to be innovative with our classics. This quarter we featured a new blend of McCafe Ice Coffee in Australia with great results and we continue to celebrate our core, while keeping things simple through innovative line extensions. In 2021 alone, we ran more than 100 core line extensions across the globe and these drove significant sales growth. This quarter the UK introduced the Chicken Big Mac as a limited time offer and it quickly became the market's most successful food promotion ever selling millions of sandwiches in the first two weeks. Australia and Sweden saw meaningful lifts in total Big Mac sold as they feature the Bacon Big Mac as a limited time offer. These core line extensions offer fresh news on our beloved Big Mac and drive top-line growth reminds customers of why they love our core items like Big Mac. And it reminds us of a simple truth our menu should only consist of products that deserve to be there nothing more nothing less. Of course, we've also introduced new menu innovations to satisfy changing customer taste and preferences, which is exactly what's happening now with McPlant. After a successful pilot in the UK beginning in January, we made it available across all restaurants in the UK and Ireland. As I've said before when customers are ready for McPlant, we'll be ready for them. We're excited by the progress we've made this past quarter and are even more confident in our future. When we leverage our systems collective ingenuity curiosity and collaboration and service of getting better together there is no limit to what we can achieve together. Now I'll turn it back to Kevin. \nKevin Ozan: Thanks. Our strong performance for the quarter resisted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.28, an increase of over 20% in constant currencies. This excludes about $125 million of costs for employees, landlords and suppliers in Russia and Ukraine while our restaurants are closed. It also excludes $500 million of non-operating expense to reserve for a potential settlement related to an international tax matter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 43.1%, reflecting improved sales performance, partially offset by higher G&A costs. Total restaurant margin dollars grew by over $450 million in constant currencies, or 17% for the quarter, primarily driven by improvement in franchise margins. Our franchise margin in the IOM segment showed significant recovery over the prior year, reflecting strong sales performance across markets. As expected, our company operating margins were hampered by significant commodity and labor inflation. Given macroeconomic conditions, we expect these elevated inflationary pressures to continue throughout this year. G&A for the quarter was up about 20% in constant currencies, due to costs incurred for our worldwide convention earlier this month, higher long-term performance-based compensation and higher depreciation related to investments in restaurant technology. And our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce second quarter EPS by about $0.08 to $0.10 and full year EPS by $0.22 to $0.24. As always, this is directional guidance only, as rates will likely change as we move through the year. And now, I'll turn it back to Chris to close.\nChris Kempczinski: At our convention, we featured franchisee after franchisee leaving a legacy in their communities. They're doing more than serving delicious food to busy people, they're employers of choice, favorite destinations for local customers and a local force for good. They\u2019re restaurants are places where people can bring their whole selves to work and put their whole hearts into treating their customers well. We know where that magic begins. We have the most valuable brand in the industry, because we have the best people in the world. The belief that people come first is so fundamental to who we are as a brand that it's our very first core value. How we treat our people directly shapes how they treat our customers. It's no secret that an industry after industry, including ours, COVID-19 has transformed how people think about life and how they weigh these seemingly endless choices in front of them, including career choices. So at convention we reaffirmed our commitment to create a McDonald's that is as well-known for its employee experience, as it is for our Golden Arches. We've made a lot of progress in the past few years, from raising wages at company-owned restaurants in the US, to our progress on closing global pay gaps, including gender equity, to the deep bench of talent we have that\u2019s allowing us to make strides and increased representation and leadership among women and historically underrepresented groups. And as we announced last year, we started 2022 by implementing our global brand standards, which were designed to create a culture of physical and psychological safety for both employees and customers in McDonald's restaurants around the world. Last week in the US, we announced a new initiative called Thank You Crew, building up the concept we had created to support first responders and teachers throughout the pandemic. Now we're turning the tables to support our restaurant teams, who keep the arches shining. We're inviting customers to participate as well asking them to submit instances for crew and managers who go above and beyond their typical duties. The work of attracting, developing and retaining the best people has always been central to McDonald's success but has never been harder or more mission-critical than it is today. Fred Turner used to say that where other see challenges McDonald's sees opportunities. As we work to raise our ambition and accelerate the Arches, we will continue to shape this opportunity in ways that help people and McDonald's achieve their full potential. And with that we'll begin Q&A. \nA - Mike Cieplak: [Operator Instructions] David Tarantino your question, please.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. My question, Chris is about the situation in Europe more broadly. And I was wondering if you could comment on what you've seen since the Russia-Ukraine incident began in terms of consumer behavior, not necessarily in those markets I know you paused operations there. But what the spillover effects might have been in the broader Europe region? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Thanks, David. I think as you know from our results, the business in the international markets, particularly in Europe it performed very strongly during Q1. We saw great growth in UK and France Germany many of our large markets in Europe. So I would say that based on Q1 results we didn't see a significant impact on it. I think what's obviously on everybody's mind is around sentiment. And what you're seeing is concern around consumer sentiment probably most pronounced in Europe but it's not yet showing up in business performance but it's certainly something we're keeping an eye on.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore. \nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I was wondering if you could perhaps characterize the recovery to date in your IOM countries? Perhaps you could speak to the percent back to \u2013 versus pre-COVID levels in traffic or sales? And what is your general feeling about the path back to pre-COVID levels in these markets or any of these do you anticipate coming back faster than others based on what you're seeing? Thanks.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. Thanks, David. We came into this year expecting that really our \u2013 certainly our large IOM markets, primarily Europe, as well as Australia and Canada would fully recover back to their 2019 levels. And we've seen that through first quarter. So all of those five big markets have now surpassed their 2019 sales levels. And really, as we've talked before couple of them like Australia, Canada, and UK had been doing really well all through the pandemic. And so they were just kind of continuing their strong performance. The two markets that were more impacted I think from lack of consumer mobility for France and Germany. And both of those countries had really strong performance in the first quarter this year. So we feel good about all of those markets as well as even the next tier of markets, the Spains, the Italy's, et cetera as far as being recovered at least to 2019 levels. I think to Chris' point on the earlier question there is a consumer sentiment concern with some of those European markets, just because of everything going on between inflation and the Russia-Ukraine crisis et cetera. But from our business we've seen really good performance and feel good about that segment.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from your customer maybe in the US and in particular. Have behaviors changed at all of late? And how consumers are using the brand or the menu? And just if you could kind of tie in just how well you think you're positioned currently if the consumer spending environment rolls over maybe relative to how well you've done in historical periods? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. I'll start with that and then Kevin can add on. But I think we were happy with how we performed in Q1, and we're also pleased with how we're entering into Q2. So I think overall we feel good about the US business performance. A big thing for us in the US, which is driving our growth and our success as digital, which for us has exceeded our expectations. So, we feel really good about digital. We feel really good about chicken and then we're also getting good growth continuing on delivery. To your point about, what's changed and what's not changed, I think I'll start with what hasn't changed, which is delivery despite things kind of reopening delivery is still growing in a significant part of the business. And that's consistent with what we've seen in other markets elsewhere around the world that have reopened delivery continues to remain elevated. Digital also continues to be a growing and highly preferred means for our consumers to be interacting with the brand, I think the only thing that we are keeping an eye on is we've seen average check come down a little bit as perhaps you're seeing those large groups that were going out and ordering in the pandemic you might see that \u2013 we're seeing some of that splintering where it's breaking up into two transaction, which was maybe previously one transaction. And then we are seeing also that, certain parts of the business and in certain geographies there is a little bit of a trade down that we're seeing that we're just keeping an eye on there. But overall feel good about the business in the US and confident about performance heading into Q2.\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. The only other thing, I'd say is what's important to us and our business is consumer mobility. And I think consumer mobility is still pretty good. Consumers are definitely worried about inflation. There's no doubt about that. They're concerned about energy and gas prices. But right now and we are keeping certainly a close watch on lower-end consumers just to make sure that we're still providing the right value for our lower-end consumers. But one of the things that's probably helpful right now, as you know is food at home is even -- has been increasing even more than food away from home. So that's probably been a little benefit also. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. First, Kevin, I know you talked qualitatively about inflationary pressures, but -- can you update kind of where you think inflation is running now both maybe commodities and labor in your key markets? And in the U.S., can you just talk about where your pricing stands now? And is there a reasonable way for us to kind of measure transaction or growth in the business understanding that traffic may be a hard thing to measure, but you look to talk to like item counts being up? How should we think about the health of the U.S. consumer in light of the fact that digital is going well, delivery is going on, et cetera, but if you looked at the comp number you backed out pricing you might still think transactions might be down year-over-year?\nKevin Ozan: Sure. Let me give a shot to try and cover a little of all of that, and I'll try not to talk for the next 30 minutes. So let me start with inflation. In the U.S., I think last quarter, I mentioned that we thought commodities were going to be up roughly 8% or so for the U.S. That number is now more like 12% to 14% for the year. So U.S. commodities clearly have risen. That's our current estimate. Obviously, the landscape is changing pretty rapidly. So we'll need to keep a close eye on that, but that certainly increased substantially. Similarly, in our IOM markets that number, I think, last quarter was more around six-or-so percent that's now doubled and is similar to the U.S. kind of that 12% to 14% range. So the commodity side, food and paper inflation has definitely increased substantially for various reasons including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. On the labor side, in the U.S., it's probably over 10% right now. Part of that is because you'll recall that we made adjustments to our wages in our company-owned restaurants mid-year last year, so we haven't lapped that. So part of it is due to that and part of it is due to just continued wage inflation. If I -- on the price -- so let me try and walk through the U.S. to help understand some of the dynamics you were talking about. Right now in the first quarter year-over-year, our pricing is up and these will all be rough numbers, so take them as round numbers. But our pricing is up roughly 8%. Again, that's first quarter this year over first quarter last year. We are still seeing similar flow-through from the pricing we're taking to our comp. So kind of from a resistant standpoint, we haven't seen any substantial increase in consumer resistance from this pricing. So that flow-through is roughly 70% or so. Again, not an exact science, but roughly 70%. So if you take that 8% pricing with a roughly 70% flow-through, you're around 5.5% from pricing, let's say, that's hitting comp sales. Chris just mentioned that we're seeing a little bit of trade down in our product mix and we're seeing a little bit lower items per transaction or smaller order sizes. Those order sizes are still much higher than pre-COVID. But on a year-over-year basis, it is a little bit lower. Those two impacts gets to our average check increase then of about 4.5%. So pricing gives me about 5.5% by overall is 4.5% that little bit of trade down a little bit of lower items is taking me from 5.5% to 4.5%. The last piece is obviously guest counts or transactions. Those were roughly down 1% in the first quarter which then gets you to our comp sales of around 3.5%. So, hopefully that helps us lay out kind of the different pieces that are going on. I got a lot of changing dynamics a lot of complex things going on. But roughly that's the way the business performed first quarter this year. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. Kevin, hopefully, a simple question for you. How should we think about the next few years of CapEx relative to 2022's $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion as US reimaging winds down, but restaurant development is ramping up? And within that as well I know China is an asset-light market for you guys. If you could just comment on the 800 stores you previously planned to open there? Is that still on track, or is the COVID flareup you're seeing there weighing on that? Thank you.\nKevin Ozan: Yes. So, let me start with the CapEx. The CapEx to your point we've said for this year it's $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. I think we expect a relatively similar range for the next few years. The make-up of that $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion will be different to your point because -- we are -- we will be substantially complete with our remodeling in the US at the end of this year. So, more of the CapEx from a percentage standpoint and dollar standpoint will be on new units versus remodels, but the overall envelope will probably be relatively similar at this year in that $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion range. Regarding China, as you mentioned, we've indicated that right now we expect roughly 800 store openings this year. They opened about 250 or so in the first quarter. That's still on track, but we are keeping a close eye on that because of everything that's going on in China as you mentioned and we have two. There's been major lockdowns in some large cities certainly over the last couple of months that even continue today. That could impact openings this year one either from not being able to open or two from just our reevaluation of the timing of some openings. But right now we're still on plan with those 800, but we are keeping a close eye on everything going on in China.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey thanks for the question. I think you mentioned you'd provide an update on your plans for Russia and Ukraine by the end of the second quarter. But maybe if you could tell us what options might be on the table at this point? And then so we're all on the same page perhaps you could think help us think through the model implications for this year assuming those stores remain closed for the full year? \nChris Kempczinski: Sure. I'll start and then Kevin can maybe talk modeling. But I think it's probably as you would imagine best that we not get into the variety of different options that we're looking at, considerations for our people over there lots of different constituencies. So, I think it's probably best that we not go through that at this point. But we will be providing -- as I said in my opening comments, we will be providing clarity on that by no later than the end of the second quarter. I would tell you that we are being exhaustive. So, my guess is that there probably isn't a scenario that you could come up with on your own that we're not looking at. But I'll just leave it at that and let Kevin answer any of the modeling questions.\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. I mean just from near-term modeling, I think we've talked about kind of a right now we continue to pay our employees, our landlords, some supply chain costs and that run rate is roughly $50 million is probably a little bit higher than that right now, partly because the Russian ruble has strengthened. So it could be $55 million or so. But that's kind of a monthly run rate right now for keeping the infrastructure going to Chris's point and what we've said is by us making a decision by the end of the second quarter, something will likely happen after that that will either change infrastructure one way or the other of changing kind of the way we think about this going forward. So from a modeling perspective, second quarter I think it's fair to use what we've said related to kind of the ongoing costs. Going forward, after second quarter, we'll certainly depend on where we end up and what option and what our -- what we announced by the end of the second quarter. I think we have talked about obviously the impact or the relevant size of the -- both Russia and Ukraine from a sales operating income et cetera perspective.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. I wanted to ask with regards to the worldwide convention. So performance is really strong over the last couple of years. Franchisee is also facing a lot of challenges. Can you talk about some uncertainty in the consumer environment? So can you just talk about sentiment among franchisees at the convention biggest takeaways or learnings from your conversations priorities concerns anything to share?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well the -- we're actually in field right now getting detailed feedback from the 14,000 participants that we had. But I would say anecdotally, what I heard back from people was just a tremendous excitement of being back together again. And when you haven't seen some of these people in four years, which is true for many of our franchisees, who typically use convention as a way to connect with their colleagues around the world, just a lot of excitement to be back together. And also talk about what we've been through and also where we're headed to. And I think there was a nice balance of looking back, but also making sure that we're being forward-facing on that. I did hear many people talk about this being one of the best conventions that they've attended or can remember attending. Now part of that maybe it's been four years since the last one. But there was I think a sense amongst franchisees when they consider all the things that have gone on in the world, boy it feels really good to be part of McDonald's. And that goes to my comment about there's never been a better time to be part of McDonald's. All you have to do is look at sort of what everyone else has gone through and compare our relative position on that. And I think you come away that sentiment. We did share as finally a number of things that we are looking at, particularly around restaurant operations. This includes everything from automated order taking which -- many of our international franchisees have not seen, our US franchisees have had more visibility on that, a lot of interest and attention in that as you would imagine. We also showed them some different ways that we're thinking about dual lane drive-thru and perhaps adding a second percent window at a dual lane drive-thru. That was also interesting for people and other ways for us to bring automation into kitchen operations. So that was kind of everything that was going on at convention, but just a lot of connecting and socializing as well.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the US loyalty rollout. I think you mentioned 26 million members, which seems like a pretty quick ramp. And I know you mentioned it being above plan. That number is kind of similar to some of the other industry leaders in the US business. I'm just wondering maybe you can give some color maybe on the average check learnings for those or the traffic implications? And where you think that maybe can go? Obviously, I'm assuming you know maybe your total unique customer base or initiatives you're using to push that number. So any color you could give would be great? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. So I'd start with the fact that we've always viewed loyalty for us as a frequency play. In the US we see roughly 80% of the population in a given year that visit our restaurant at least one time. So we don't have a big reach opportunity at McDonald's. Our opportunity is always about driving frequency. And one of the things that we've been encouraged by what we've seen with loyalty so far is it has proven to be an effective way for us to drive frequency among our users. In terms of where we are, our view is we're still early innings on this. We have low levels of penetration versus our total market size opportunity here. And for us the focus then is continuing to drive overall enrollment but also to be driving engagement. And one of the things that we're spending time on as we get more facts under our belt here is what is the right metric that's most predictive of future performance? So is it absolute members? Is it monthly? Is it 90 days? We're doing a lot of analysis on that to just get tighter as we've had a year's worth of data under our belt. And we'll at some point I'm sure once we've got some conclusive findings on that come back and share that with all of you. But early innings would be the headline.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to go back to the sort of differences among US consumers maybe that you're seeing. I know you mentioned maybe a bit of trade down, but at the same time people seem willing to still pay for the added convenience of delivery. And my sense is the fees in fact broadly speaking are going up not down for the industry. So could you just -- is it a different customer that is using the -- being a little more persons with your menu versus the one who's continuing to pay for delivery? And broadly as you look at across countries, is there a difference in delivery penetration based on availability of drive-thru in the sense that maybe the convenience premium is higher if there's not as much access through drive-thrus?\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. I think the headline is that the overall US consumer from our vantage point is in good shape. And consumer balance sheets in the US broadly speaking again at the average are strong, which gives us the optimism as I talked about earlier as we head into Q2. Now you deaverage, which is what you always have to do in these situations. And I think you do start to see that the lower income consumer particularly around gas prices and the pressure that that puts on pocket book the pressure around rents that there probably is an increased value sensitivity with that lower income consumer. We don't have the detailed type of data that you would love to have that would allow us to slice and dice it. So we're having to use ZIP codes and other things as proxies for that. But I think it's probably fair to say that the lower income consumer is probably feeling more pressure than the average consumer or certainly the wealthier consumer. And that's why for us, we need to make sure that we continue to have value be an important part of our proposition. It always is one of the things that defines McDonald's is making sure that we stay strong on value. We're pleased right now because as we look at our value scores relative to our competition, consumers are still giving us a lot of credit for being a good value. But we just need to make sure as we're working through some of the inflation that Kevin talked to earlier, that we don't lose track of -- we still need to be providing good value to consumers. And -- there's a lot of different ways for us to do that. Joe and the team are spending a lot of time with US franchisees on how to think through that and navigate it. But we've always got to stay competitive on value. When we lose sight of that, there's a long history of that being where we've kind of gotten off track. So I can promise you, we're not losing sight of it. But broadly the US consumer from our vantage point is still in good shape.\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'd add to your point about, are there different delivery dynamics around the world? In, general our delivery percentage is a little higher in Europe than it is here in the US. UK is one of our strongest kind of delivery markets. I think, there's multiple factors for that. Obviously drive-thrus are a little bit lower percentage in Europe than they are in the US, so some of it said, population density urban versus rural et cetera all of that comes into play. But in general, our delivery percentages are a little bit higher in Europe than they are in the US.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. \nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. The question is on the US and I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on traffic by daypart. If you're actually seeing maybe some positive results in lunch and dinner maybe offset by negative results in breakfast and late night? And if I can kind of continue with that comment, do you have an opportunity of increasing store hours relative to where you were in 2019? And do you have an opportunity to maybe maximize some of the square footage that resides within the dining rooms that I would assume are below average utilization? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, without getting too much into decomposing our comp into various dayparts, I would tell you that, whether you look at it on a Q1 basis or you look at it on a three-year basis, we've actually seen from a comp sales standpoint, we've seen breakfast and dinner be standout performers for us. Lunch has been a little bit more modest from a performance standpoint. So we feel really good about what we've seen again at breakfast and dinner. Late night traded off as you would have imagined for a variety of reasons. Some of it was related to operating hours there et cetera. But those two elements are strong. As we think about what lunch is going to look like going forward, it's certainly the biggest part of our daypart mix. We're still seeing growth in that. It's just not at the same levels that we're seeing in those other two dayparts. Kevin, I don't know if you want to add?\nKevin Ozan: The only thing I'd say related to your operating point in stores reopening et cetera. Right now, roughly 95% of the restaurants in the US are fully operational, meaning that they're open for both dine-in and drive-thru et cetera. And the rest we expect to be pretty fully operational in the next few months or so. We generally do see some sales lift when dining rooms first reopen. It's not dramatic, I'll say, but obviously just moving some of the sales from drive-thru to dine-in helps from a capacity and pressure stamp throughput pressure et cetera. There still is \u2013 to your point I think the store hours are probably down a little bit specifically late night and overnight hours are down a little bit from where they were pre-pandemic. And part that's because just \u2013 not McDonald's traffic, but just traffic outside is down in those same hours. So there is potential at some point to \u2013 if traffic comes back at some of those hours us to be able to gain some more of our traffic also during those late night and overnight hours.\nChris Kempczinski: The only thing, I would add which may be is the question behind the question. I don't know, but I'm just \u2013 I'll throw this out there. I said in the last earnings call that, our whole mentality is we're in a share-taking mode. And we saw that play out in Q1 and it's played out not just on the quarter, but it's played out over the last several quarters. And it's played out from both a comp sales standpoint as well as from a guest count standpoint within QSR. So the relative mix within our own is interesting, but it's also about how is our performance compared to our QSR peers and our mindset is about stealing share and that's what we're seeing in the numbers both on sales and on traffic.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you so much. And perfect timing because I wanted to ask something that really coincides with that. So I wanted to reconcile or validate that you're taking share traffic down. So you're not losing share to legacy QSR peers. Are people going to convenience stores? Is your customer taking a break at home and eating there? And if so what are the tools or messages you used to get them back from those places?\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. So if you broaden it out to IEO, which is a larger definition we are seeing a little bit of traffic share loss in the US. I mean, it's a \u2013 less than a decimal point type of share loss there. I think it's maybe 0.3 or something like that that we've lost versus IEO. That's in the US only. If you look at it globally we're actually taking share globally against even the IEO market. And as you know in IEO in the US there's just so much noise around who was open who was closed. It's difficult when you're comparing share change versus 2021 or you're comparing share change over a three-year time period given all the noise in the number It's a little bit challenging to actually make a conclusion off of that. But we're looking at performance both on IEO and QSR and feeling good about what we're seeing.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChris Carril: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin so just following up on your commentary earlier around cost inflation and pricing, can you provide any further thoughts on your consolidated operating margin guidance? I believe the guidance hasn't changed from the low to mid-40% range previously provided. So curious if you could expand on that a little bit more in the context of the current operating backdrop?\nKevin Ozan: Yeah. I think for this year we still feel pretty good about that low to mid-40% range. We won't get the leverage obviously that we all would hope for going forward. So I think there's opportunity to get leverage on that post these large inflationary pressures which is why we're still remaining with that low to mid-40 range. I think last quarter someone asked why it wasn't higher than that. And I think the near-term inflationary pressures are keeping that at the low to mid-40% range for this year.  I think post-2022, again obviously depending on what happens with all these inflationary pressures, but if those get back down to a, I'll call it a low to a reasonable level, we believe there's opportunity to gain leverage on that operating margin line going forward. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Mullan: Hey, thank you. A question on the US business kind of back to the share gain mentality. You've called out chicken as an area of focus for the business this year. Just wondering if you could give a sense of the opportunity however you see it? And how much share do you have today or versus what did you have in 2019? And then from here is this a multiyear runway you see to take share in the menu side? \nChris Kempczinski: Sure. So, if you think about burger and chicken as being our two sandwich areas we've taken share in the US in both of those. Beef is obviously -- or burger is obviously the most significant or a sizable part of our business there. And if you think about where we're at there we own little over 1/3 of the market from a share standpoint in the US on beef and we've picked up about a share point there versus where we were in 2019. If you think about chicken, which is not for us as sizable but still an important part of the business, we've picked up about 0.5 point of share there if you look at where we were prior to the launch of the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. So, seeing good share performance in both of those areas. And our thing is with our Accelerating the Arches strategy, we're focused on chicken, coffee and burgers. It's those three areas and we maniacally track share on all three of those categories across all of our markets. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Citi. \nJon Tower: Great. Thanks. A quick clarification then a question. Kevin, in terms of the ongoing impact of Russia and Ukraine it looks like that was put into the other operating income expense line. Should we expect those costs to remain there in the future that's clarification? And then the question side is more about the US piece of the business. And I think Chris in an answer to a previous question you kind of hit on this. But I just want to make sure I get further clarification.  In terms of the way the brand has been positioned historically I think in the US, it's been much more focused on traffic growth in an absolute sense versus just relative in part by ensuring that check growth never really took off especially on the pricing side, that seems to have shifted around or coming out of COVID. So, is that something you expect to persist into the future? And is it right to think about the business more on a relative share gain basis on the traffic front in the future versus absolute traffic? \nChris Kempczinski: Yes. I'll give my own thought and then Kevin can chime in. But I think for the last -- since COVID hit basically at the beginning of 2020, we've -- in all of the various calls with you and I think probably across the entire industry we've all struggle to figure out what is the right way to think about traffic. And probably our historic approach which is guest counts we -- we've recognized that there are shortfalls with that which is why Kevin came up with his other category, which was called stuff and just selling more stuff or said another way just more units. I would say, on all of that it's still unclear to us what is the right way for us to be assessing. We're still seeing a lot of changing consumer behavior whether it's through digital, whether it's through delivery and how all of that sort of levels out and then you get a clean read of what the go-forward means. I don't think we're there yet at this point. But we certainly look at our relative performance versus our competitors on that. And so long as we're beating our competitors we feel good about it. And we worry may be a little bit less about what the absolutes are and it's more about are we stealing share.\nKevin Ozan: And then your question Jon about the Russia cost. We put those included in other operating. I think we have a separate line in the detail. I think we call it impairment and other charges maybe. I think in our mind, it was the easiest way to specifically call those specific costs out. So everyone understands, what costs we are incurring related to those operations while the restaurants are closed. So our intent is to do the same going forward just to be able to show all the costs we're incurring related to effectively operations that aren't occurring.\nMike Cieplak: Nearing the hour Mark we'll take one more. Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. \nJared Garber: Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I wanted to swing back to commentary on digital and maybe taking a longer-term view. Obviously, the digital business has been a key driver in the last couple of years especially since the launch of MyMcDonald's. Can you maybe Chris walk us through kind of your thoughts longer term on how digital evolves? And maybe what the next evolution is? And how you think about automation and increased technology integration in the restaurants? \nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well I'd start with I think digital changes everything. So today I don't know 90% plus of the customers -- 90% of the customers coming into my restaurant, I don't know who they are. I don't know there prior purchase. I don't know what their buying pattern is. I don't know are they a deal seeker. Are they someone who always orders the same thing? Do they like to try new things? So as I get better and better visibility into that customer I can actually track and identify their preferences over time it starts with I'm going to be able to give them a better experience. I'm going to be able to give them faster speed of service. I'm going to be able to give them a cleaner app a cleaner menu board. And I'm going to be able to give them deals offers programs that are more personalized to what they're looking for. It's not going to necessarily be a one-size-fits-all type of thing it's going to be much more bespoke to what each customer is looking for. And digital allows us to do a level of personalization at scale at McDonald's that is almost impossible for us to do through sort of more of our analog type of approach. As you start to then get much more of this data about buying behaviors purchases you can get it integrated into restaurant operations, and it gives you opportunity to do automation. It gives you speed of service opportunity positioning that has labor benefits. So it can change I think just the entire unit economic profile for the better of what a restaurant looks like. We're still very early on this. So I don't want -- I want to caution against anybody out going out there and running and building a new model off of this. But if you go 10 years out that's where we're headed to because I think we all recognize those of us who are in the business day to day there is tremendous opportunity there if we can make further inroads. \nMike Cieplak: Thank you, Chris and Kevin. Thanks everyone who joined the call today. Have a great day."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-02-05 12:16:06", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Fourth Quarter 2023 Investor Conference Call.

Today's conference all is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year we shared the despite a challenging operating environment McDonald's continued to deliver historically high levels of growth. While macroeconomic pressures persisted throughout 2023, the resilience and power of our system was on full display, and we are heading into the new year in a position of strength. In 2023, we achieved global comp sales growth of 9%. Delivered comp guest count performance of nearly 3% globally with positive traffic across each of our segments, and maintained our leading market share across most of our major markets. These results are a credit to the tireless dedication of the entire McDonald's system. The over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, the industry's best franchisees and our world-class network of suppliers around the world, all executing with excellence and with an unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities. And in our restaurant focusing on the fundamentals of creating an exceptional customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times and increased customer satisfaction across almost all of our major markets. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, fueling over 30% comparable sales growth since 2019 and our MCD growth pillars enable us to remain agile in response to changing customer needs. For example, we've expanded loyalty to 50 markets around the world and reached over 20 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales in 2023. Our user base continues to grow with over 150 million users that have been active in the last 90 days, making us one of the largest loyalty programs in the world. Over the last three years, we've also delivered tremendous growth in chicken by developing the McCrispy, a globally consistent high quality chicken sandwich. With the goal of solving this unmet customer need across the system, it was developed and tested in a few markets first and has quickly scaled to $1 billion brand across more than 30 markets worldwide. Our chicken category now represents $25 billion in annual system-wide sales, on par with beef. And about a year ago, we formed a new business ventures team designed to operate as an entrepreneurial startup within McDonald's. The team quickly identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across our top six markets that comprised of beverage-led occasions where our core McDonald's business underindexes. In a little less than a year, the team opened a pilot CosMc's restaurant, and the buzz has been electric. Now let me say this again, we're only talking about a 10-store test. But more than that, we're excited about what this says about our potential to test, learn, and innovate quickly. Each of these examples illustrate our ability to identify opportunities and adopt new ways to surprise and delight our customers. It gives us an incredible amount of resilience as a system, no matter where the customer goes next or what the macroeconomic landscape may bring. In the last year, we also implemented Accelerating the Organization, an effort to modernize the way we work so that we're faster, more innovative, and more efficient. And over the past year, as I've had the opportunity to visit markets around the world, I've witnessed how the principles of ATO have empowered our teams to take the right risks, lead in innovation, and reduce complexity in decision making. Some of the senior leadership team and I recently visited Salt Lake City, and I witnessed firsthand how knowledge sharing across the system is unlocking speed and driving customer lifetime value. The business unit is part of our Denver field office, which, as a whole, has embraced the power of digital, maximizing our platform to drive frequency and engagement with customers. This means, that the restaurants can take full advantage of Ready on Arrival. In addition to a national average 60-second reduction in wait times for customers that pick up curbside in our restaurant, or higher customer satisfaction in these transactions. Ready on Arrival benefits the crew by giving the right information to the right person in the restaurant to deliver food faster and hotter. As a result, we've reduced complexity and stress in restaurants, and Salt Lake franchisees are driving higher levels of guest count growth and franchisee cash flow. By removing layers between our people and the restaurants and implementing a One McDonald's way approach, collaborating across the organization is much more intuitive and teams bring the full breadth of McDonald's resources, skills and experiences to the forefront when making decisions. And as critical as this power of global scale is to our competitive advantage, at our core, we are a global business that is run by local small business owners that employ thousands within their communities. Since the beginning of our brand's history, McDonald's and our franchisees have been steadfast in the support of our communities in the most challenging times. And whether it was the recent earthquake in Japan, the tragedies that struck Morocco and Hawaii last year, or the war in the Middle East, our focus is on creating a positive impact in the communities we serve. Across the more than 75 markets in our IDL segment, McDonald's is a major employer of local citizens, creating valuable career opportunities for more than 780,000 local employees in both restaurant and office jobs and at more than 1,000 locally owned suppliers. We're proud to grow that footprint. In 2023, the IDL segment opened an average of four new restaurants every single day, creating new jobs for nearly 50,000 people this year alone. And by removing barriers for children who need healthcare, Ronald McDonald's House Charities helped to provide essential services for over 870,000 families across this segment. For the over 130,000 workers in our Europe, Middle East, and Africa business, our number one priority is keeping our people safe. We recognize that families and their communities in the region continue to be tragically impacted by the war and our thoughts are with them at this time. McDonald's has always been a beacon in our communities around the world, led by local franchisees who work tirelessly to serve and support. The ongoing impact of the war on these franchisees' local businesses is disheartening and ill-founded. As our values state, McDonald's will always proudly open our doors to everyone. Thinking back on 2023, I can't help, but feel tremendous pride in the entire McDonald's system. And as we think about our ambitions and the potential that lies ahead, there's never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's. As I will continue to say, we believe there's still significant runway in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and we're setting our sights even higher. I'll speak more on the year ahead in a few minutes, but first I'll turn it over to Ian to talk through our Q4 results.\nIan Borden: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned just a few minutes ago, core to Accelerating the Arches strategy is putting the customer at the center of every decision we make, acting with agility in any environment to deliver delicious, feel-good moments at an affordable price each and every day. Our quarter four comp sales performance of over 4% in both the U.S. and IOM segments and over 3% globally remains a direct result of exceptional execution against this strategy, making it clear once again that our business is resilient despite ongoing macro pressures and challenges. As a system, we've navigated countless challenging environments since we first opened our doors in 1955. This past quarter was no exception, and our thoughts remain with the families and communities impacted by the war in the Middle East. As Chris and I have both mentioned before, the war has meaningfully impacted our IDL segment performance, resulting in fourth quarter comp sales of less than 1%. Despite this, our business model provides stability in our P&L from the negative sales impact in the region. Among the many strategic advantages of McDonald's are our size, scale, and geographic diversity, translating to incredible resilience as a system. We will continue to stay focused on supporting our people and the local communities in which we operate as we work closely with our [DL] (ph) partners in the region. We are extremely proud of the way our system continues to conistantly show up for customers in every corner of the world, highlighting time and time again the strength of the McDonald's brand when our system comes together. Providing our customers with affordable options has always been core to our brand, and it's even more important as consumers feel pressure on their spending, particularly the lower-income consumer. We continue to listen to our customers by evolving our value offerings, maintaining strong perceptions in value for money and affordability. Canada, for example, maintained their McMuffin and hot coffee pairing this quarter, providing an affordable bundle during a critical day part and helping to drive market share gains in breakfast. The UK followed a similar playbook by expanding their Saver Meal deals to offer smaller bundles during the morning day part for just a few pounds. Only available through our mobile app, this further cemented McDonald's UK as a destination for great food at great value, while contributing to increased loyalty sales. The UK also combined the strength of the McDonald's brand with its proven history of connecting with customers through successful holiday marketing to create Festive Wins, an elevated in-app experience that leaned into the holiday spirit with a fun and interactive calendar promotion. Through our combination of daily deals, compelling prizes, and exclusive merchandise, Festive Wins boosted digital engagement to an all-time high for the market and generated 4 million active monthly customers. And in Australia, the market brought back its 30-days, 30-deals promotion, where customers enjoyed a daily deal available exclusive in the MyMacca's app. From discounts on our most iconic menu items like the Big Mac cheeseburger or our world famous French Fries to unique meal deals, the promotion drove remarkable engagement and contributed to a record number of active loyalty members in the market. Beyond maintaining an affordable price point we're constantly elevating the McDonald's experience enhancing the overall value of proposition of the brand. This was evident as many markets offered monopoly this quarter, leveraging learnings from across the globe to create highly interactive campaigns and once again igniting our fan's love for McDonald's. The Canadian market tapped into global best practices by offering MONOPOLY with a double peel option for the first time this year. By giving customers a second chance to win in the app. The market continued to amplify the digital experience, while maintaining those core qualities of the game that our customers love. The customer excitement was on full display and the market achieved record-setting results generating nearly 700,000 new app customers in just five weeks and driving significant lifts in mobile app sales. In fact, more than 43 million MONOPOLY codes were digitally redeemed during the promotion. That's more than the entire population of Canada. Germany also experienced record-breaking registrations with their MONOPOLY program by combining iconic peel-off game pieces with the ability to scan to win prizes in the mobile app. And for the first time, Germany offered loyalty points as prizes, rewarding our customers and driving additional digital customer frequency. And in France, MONOPOLY drove additional loyalty sales with an interactive redemption experience for our customers. We continue to navigate a difficult operating environment in the market, where results were softened and comp sales were negative for the quarter. Moving forward, we're confident that we have the right leadership team in place with the right experience to reset with our franchisees who I know are committed to restoring our strong foundation. We're acting with a sense of urgency to address our opportunities and maintaining a growth mindset in critical areas like value, core menu and delivery. Our One McDonald's Way approach to marketing extends beyond MONOPOLY as we continue to drive brand strength, building cultural relevance, and connecting with our customers and crew in new and exciting ways. This quarter, we once again tapped into the nostalgic McDonald's experience of enjoying a happy meal as a kid and recreated it for our adult fans, featuring our core menu favorites at the center. Originally launched in the U.S. in 2022, we brought back the campaign to the market in December partnering with artist and creator, Kerwin Frost, and scaling it to 15 additional markets including Canada. The excitement for the return of this event was evident, driving a significant social media engagement across many of our channels. And by encouraging our customers to trade up with a full margin promotion, we feel top line growth with a strong average checklist. In an environment where our customers are looking to familiar favorites those core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. At the center of our core menu are an iconic portfolio of brands. $17 billion brands in their right, including four different chicken equities that are each $1 billion brands. We continue to stay aggressive on chicken this quarter making further progress towards our ambition of developing a reputation for great chicken. Germany re-hit the McCrispy chicken sandwich with strong results driving a lift in chicken sandwich sales and building additional customer affinity for the product. And the UK built on its market leadership in chicken by extending the McCrispy brand with a limited time offering, the McCrispy Smokehouse, combining new and exciting flavors and ingredients with our core chicken offerings. In China, with slowing macro-economic conditions and consumer confidence near record lows, the market continued to build brand equity by combining our delicious food with culture and community through a collaboration with local streetwear designer Verdict. The campaign not only featured access to exclusive merchandise, but put our delicious chicken at the center and drove incremental traffic into our restaurants by offering customers a discount on a second order. Turning to our P&L, our top line growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 for the quarter. This is an increase over the prior year of 11% in constant currencies, excluding current year charges of almost $140 million for write-offs of impaired software no longer in use and charges related to our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy. Foreign currency translation positively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.07 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was just over 47%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments. Despite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed throughout the year, top line results generated $14 billion of restaurant margin for the year, an increase of about 10% in constant currency. Lastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was approximately $2.4 billion, with more than half invested in new unit development across our US and IOM segments. After reinvesting in the business our free cash flow conversion was in the 90% range for the year. Now with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. As we look to 2024 with elevated absolute prices and muted consumer confidence, we believe that consumers will continue to be more discriminating with their dollars, but we expect our focus on our MCD\u2019s will continue to drive growth across our business. And from a historical perspective we know our resilience is rooted in our ability to adopt in any environment. McDonald's is one of the world\u2019s most recognized and most bellowed brands, providing delicious meals at an affordable price and showing up when and where customers need us. By building a One McDonald's way of approach marketing and creative excellence, we will continue to scale the best ideas globally through common tools and processes that help us maximize return on investment and that shine a light on what people love about McDonald's. We're creating an environment that embraces bold creative and we're remaining connected to culture by tapping into the moments, memories, rituals, and behaviors that people have with our brand. And McDonald's position on value is a competitive advantage with a strategy rooted in customer behaviors and insights. We are optimizing price while limiting customer resistance. As we continue to attract millions of new loyalty members, we can get even smarter with our pricing methodology and tailor our digital offers to our fans, making them even more personalized. Looking ahead, we'll also continue to make our core menu even more enticing. With initiatives like Best Burger, we've made small changes that are adding up to a big difference that our customers are really noticing. Best Burger is now deployed across more than 70 markets, including the U.S. And we're excited about the potential for growth as it deploys to nearly all markets by 2026. And as we look to build on our leadership in beef, we're addressing an unmet customer need across markets for larger high quality burgers. We're working horizontally across the system to innovate. As we test and learn, we'll be working to understand how the new offering will complement our already established burgers, like the Double QPC or the Big Tasty. We're also excited to further build on our success in chicken by continuing to in invest in bellowed icons like McNuggets and McChicken, while further scaling the emerging favourites like McCrispy and McSpicy. These four equities are the building blocks of our growing chicken business and we see the potential to add another point of chicken share by 2026, in part through an expansion of our McCrispy platform into wraps and tenders. We've made incredible progress across our 4Ds by taking the things our customers love about McDonald's from convenience to personal connections with our brand and making them even better. For example, Ready on Arrival will expand across our top six markets by the end of 2025. And while we've built one of the largest loyalty programs in the world in just a few years, over 150 million active users today represents only a fraction of our total customers. We aim to reach 250 million active users and $45 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales by the end of 2027. And as you heard during our investor update, the world's largest restaurant company is planning to grow even faster over the next four years. We know our ambition to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 is a compelling opportunity and we've done our homework. We've identified key areas with high population growth and lower store density across both our IOM and U.S. segments, and that's where we're starting. These opportunities before us in the near term are compelling, but as we plan for long-term growth and solidifying McDonald's leadership position we've introduced three new platforms that will become part of Accelerating the Arches to build on our competitive advantages, cement our place and culture, and stay one step ahead of the next generation of digital customers. This includes building one of the largest consumer platforms in the world to attract and retain highly valuable digital and loyalty customers. The easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform that puts intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams and drives a better experience for both our customers and our crew, and the company platform that unlocks speed and innovation. We believe our biggest opportunity to advance and acquire new customers and build more meaningful customer relationships that result in greater frequency and spending is continuing to aggressively invest in digital and technology as a three-legged stool. For our customers, we will better leverage the data we have across our loyalty programs to provide targeted offers and personalized experiences, building relationships with the customers that we serve every single day and ensuring that they enjoy a more familiar, consistent experience no matter where they go or how they [were] (ph). For restaurants, it's investing to put the most intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams that makes their jobs easier and empowers them to provide amazing hospitality, while serving hot and accurate orders to customers even faster. And for the company, it is building the systems, processes, and tools that will enable our people to be more efficient and innovate with speed and agility. As I've said before, these are bold plans, but our success tomorrow has always depended on our ability to stay ahead of our customers changing needs, while reimagining what a restaurant can be. We're building the engine that will power McDonald's ability to unleash the full strength of our global scale where it counts. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Ian to talk through our 2024 financial outlook.\nIan Borden: Thanks, Chris. As we've discussed, we continue to operate in a challenging environment with varying levels of headwinds across our markets. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate these headwinds will continue as the current macro dynamics continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business results along with the war in the Middle East. As we navigate these ongoing challenges, continuing to execute at the highest level with a laser focus towards growing market share will be critical. It's clear that we've had exceptional success over the last four years with strong broad-based momentum and global comp sales of over 30% when compared to 2019. It's truly remarkable. But as we\u2019ve mentioned before, we anticipate 2024 comp sales growth will continue to moderate as we return to a more normalized level of growth with expectations closer to historical averages of between 3% and 4% in our U.S. and IOM segments. And in IDL, we do not expect to see meaningful improvement until there is a resolution in the Middle East. We expect our net restaurant expansion in 2024 along with restaurants we opened in 2023 will contribute nearly 2% to system wide sales growth as we begin to accelerate our new unit development and make progress against our target of 50,000 restaurants by 2027. With expectations of moderating sales growth and ongoing inflationary headwinds, we expect our company operated margin percent will remain pressured in the near term and we expect the full year 2024 company operated margin percent will be relatively in line with 2023. Turning to G&A, the financial strength of our system enables us to invest in areas that will drive long term efficiencies for our people and for our stakeholders. We expect 2024 G&A as a percentage of system wide sales to be about 2.2%, which reflects elevated investments in technology, digital and global business services or GBS. Through these investments we'll look to run the business more efficiently over time, and ultimately free up more resource to continue to drive long-term growth. Despite headwinds throughout the P&L, we anticipate an operating margin of mid to high 40% in 2024, driven primarily by top-line growth and franchise margin performance. We're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 9% and 11% compared to 2023 due to higher average debt balances and interest rates and we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%. Transitioning to capital expenditures we plan to spend between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion this year, more than half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings across our U.S. and IOM segments. Globally, we plan to open more than 2,100 restaurants this year, with about 500 of these openings in our U.S. and IOM segments, where we continue to see strong returns. We also expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL segment this year, including about 1,000 in China, where we recently completed the acquisition of Carlyle's 28% stake in McDonald's China. We're excited to have increased our minority ownership to 48% in our second largest and fastest growing market and believe it will enable us to further benefit from the market's long-term potential. Overall, we anticipate about 4% unit growth, driven by more than 1,600 net restaurant additions in 2024. And finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2024 with free cash flow conversion in the 90% range. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, investing in the business to drive growth. This includes both capital expenditures, as well as increased cash investments in technology, digital, and GBS. Second, returning all remaining free cashflow through dividends and share buybacks over time. While the macro environment remains challenging, we believe that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is the right playbook and we continue to maximize our [MC&D] (ph) growth pillars to drive strong results. We have confidence that our competitive strengths and our ability to continue to evolve to stay ahead of the customer positions us to succeed in any economic environment, delivering long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\nChris Kempczinski: For nearly 70 years the McDonald's story has been one of growth, a first job for millions, the best franchising opportunity in the world, and a familiar beacon of support for the over 40,000 communities we serve. In fact, our U.S. business generated 1.4 million jobs and contributed $108 billion to the U.S. GDP in the last year alone. Even as the world around us continues to change the power of our brand has stood the test of time. That\u2019s because McDonalds\u2019s continues to reinvent itself and stay one step ahead of our customers. While our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, we will only keep growing when we're continuing to take smart risks and operating with the long term mind set. Ray Kroc said it best, the only way we can advance is by going forward individually and collectively in the spirit of the pioneer, in the pride of accomplishment. Even with all that we've accomplished since the launch of Accelerating the Arches, I am confident that there is so much more that we can achieve. I look forward to coming together with all three legs of our stool at our upcoming worldwide convention this April to share how we will reimagine our future together. Thank you to our franchisees, suppliers, and employees whose passion and dedication is central to bringing the McDonald's experience to life for our customers each and every day. With that, we'll take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Probably just a two-parter. Quickly, do you think that there's any impact from boycotts to IOM results anywhere, even if they're slight? And then separately, the multi-year trends this year have been stable for a lot of the year, basically since the second quarter. I'm really thinking the U.S. very strong compared -- very strong multi-year trend. So there's no shame in these remaining stable. I'm just wondering if you think that there is a reason for those trends to reaccelerate or there's a lesson in that, maybe your best play because, obviously, we're dealing through some very noisy months here with weather and whatnot over the fourth quarter and here in January. So I'm wondering how you're viewing that with the goal perhaps being that multi-year trend can reaccelerate in 2024 and your best play to make that happen. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Hi. David. It\u2019s Chris. Thanks for the question. First on your question about the Middle East. Obviously the place that we are seeing the most pronounced impact is in the Middle East, we are seeing some impact in other Muslim countries like Malayasia, Indonesia. And then as far as IOM impact, it depends on the country. So in a country, for example France that has a larger Muslim population, we are seeing some impact in France. It depends very much on where the restaurant is located and if it's in a Muslim area. But we are seeing some impact there. And then in other countries, like Spain, like in Italy, we're seeing no impact. So it really depends very much on the country. But, as I said, the most pronounced impact that we're seeing is in the Middle East and in Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Also, as we said in our prepared remarks, our outlook is, so long as this conflict, this war is going on, we're not making any plans, we're not expecting to see any significant improvement in this. It's a human tragedy what's going on, and I think that that does weigh on brands like ours. Back to your other question about potentially a reacceleration as we also said in the prior remarks and we also talked about it at Investor Day, we're expecting 2024 to be normalizing comp sales growth in that kind of 3% to 4% range, which is, where we've been more historically. So, we certainly had great performance over whether you look at it on a two-year horizon, a four-year horizon, 30 plus percent on a four-year horizon, call it 14% or so on a two-year horizon. So, feel great about that, but I think we are moving into 2024 that\u2019s going to look more like what you would have considered a typical year prior to COVID and all the things that have gone on.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. The question is on France, and France has obviously been a leading market for McDonald's in a lot of ways for a couple of decades now, and in some cases it has actually been a leading indicator of positive performance in other markets or things that were done in France that were then copied by others quite successfully, implemented by others quite successfully. So it did sound like you had some self-help in France, value, core menu and delivery. I mean, did you find yourself, I guess, kind of catching up from behind in some of those metrics? I wanted to understand a little bit more maybe what you could have done differently in the fourth quarter to improve results? And do you think possibly there could be some leading indicators in France that are happening now within the market, of course, excluding the Middle East sentiment, that maybe we can apply to other markets to ensure those markets don't dip negative in the near term.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure, thanks for the question. You're right in pointing out France for us has been historically one of our best markets. We have some of our highest customer satisfaction in that market. We have some of our highest franchising cash flows in that market. We're not happy with our performance in France right now. And if I were to isolate two areas that we are focused on to improve in France, the first is, we did get offsides on value there. The team has done a very nice job in pivoting and just put in place a new value program there that we're seeing great early success with that. But certainly, that was a reaction and we don't want to see that. And then second, we continue to have operations opportunities in France and that's something that we've been having a lot of engagement on with our franchisees. So as I think about IOM, certainly lessons there. But on the positive side, France is certainly our most pressured market right now in France -- or in IOM, but I also feel very good that we're going to get that business back on track and continue to have the performance that we've become accustomed to in that market over many, many years.\nIan Borden: And maybe, John, I'll just build on a bit on Chris' comments. I mean, I think two things. One is, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've got almost an entirely new leadership team in place in the market, a team that has a tremendous amount of McDonald's business experience and we have a lot of confidence in that team and the experience they bring, I think, to drive the right catalyst. I think when you have a market that maybe is a little bit off track, what you look to, have you got the right people with the right experience to drive change. And then do you feel like you have clarity of sight to the kind of underlying issues that you need to address. And I think on both of those fronts, we feel good. Obviously, as Chris spoke about, it's going to kind of take a moment to get momentum going back in the right direction. But I know together with our franchisees in France, we're going to be aggressive to kind of go after the opportunities that we exist. And I think we're very, very aligned in how we're approaching that with them.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Chris, question as we think about 2024. First, I just wanted to clarify, I think you mentioned 3% to 4% comps in the U.S. and IOM. I'm not used to seeing such specific guidance, so that's encouraging. But I'm wondering if you could share any thoughts on the components of that between pricing, which we get the sense is easing versus traffic. And then just more broadly, the operating margin guidance from mid to high 40% range, let's say, fairly wide, I guess, 500 basis points or so range. I'm just wondering if you can help narrow or perhaps talk about what would lead margins to be at the upper versus lower end of that wide range. Thank you.\nIan Borden: Good morning, Jeff. It's Ian. So let me take that. I think as we talked about on the comps in our opening remarks, I think -- and we've been talking about it, as you know, pretty consistently over the last couple of quarters, as inflation levels have come down and, obviously, our pricing broadly is coming down in line with kind of inflation getting back to what I'll call more normal levels, I think that's why we talk about comps kind of getting back to more of that historical norm range of 3% to 4% in both the U.S. and IOM this year. I mean, I think the only texture I'd give you there is, we had a slower start to the year. I think there are a couple of important reasons for that. Firstly, we had a really strong start to 2023. So obviously, we're lapping against that. And then, I think you'll remember a year ago we talked about just the abnormally mild weather that we were dealing with as a tailwind benefit in beginning of 2023 in both North America and Europe, and so we're obviously working against that as well. I think if I was to think about the year, I think about the back half of the year probably being slightly stronger -- slightly stronger than probably the front half. Just again, we had an incredibly strong first two quarters of 2023 that we're working against. And I think some of the macro factors that were -- are going to impact us in 2024 could, I think, be slightly easing towards the back half of this year versus the front half. On op margin, look, I mean if you go back to 2019, I think we've had a pretty strong demonstration of what we will continue to talk about, which is, over time, certainly believe we continue to be able to drive leverage and op margin as we get the strong top line growth. If you go back to 2019, we were kind of in that 44-ish percent range. We ended last year at just over 47%. I think that's a pretty strong proof point of our ability to continue to grow margins as we look forward on a percentage basis. I think obviously, as Chris talked about 2024, we've got some headwinds to work through, but feel really confident about our ability to continue to grow margins over time.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question is on the impacts you're seeing in the Middle East. I guess two questions. One, could you help to quantify your estimate on how much that impacted your sales in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, could you comment on the health of your franchisees in the areas that have been most impacted and whether you think some temporary assistance will be needed as you move through 2024?\nChris Kempczinski: Hey, David, it's Chris. Just -- I'll do a couple of things and then let Ian clean up whatever I missed. But we're not going to get into specific numbers on the Middle East. But suffice to say, as you see in our IDL results, you can infer that the impact is meaningful, as I said also in our employee note at the beginning of this year. And then in terms of health of the franchisees, we're really fortunate in that we have some very strong, very well-capitalized franchisees in the Middle East. But as we have historically done, as we work through challenges around the world, you've seen us in partnership with franchisees do things to support them during difficult periods that sometimes can be deferrals, sometimes it can be other forms of support. And so those are ongoing conversations that we'll have with our franchisees. We believe that working in partnership with our franchisees and doing things together through good times and bad is the way that we've been successful over time. So it's going to be very much a situation-by-situation approach that we have in the Middle East, but certainly, the impact right now is significant. And Ian, I'll pass it off to you for anything else you want to add.\nIan Borden: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So maybe just a couple of builds to that. I mean, David, you know that, as I've talked about before, I think we've got an incredibly resilient business model. Obviously, if you look back over the last several years, we've had to work through a number of different external challenges, and I think the geographic breadth, the size and scale of our business and our financial strength means we're in a position of strength to kind of work through any of these challenges, including the one that we're currently facing in the Middle East with the war that's going on. In regards to kind of support for franchisees or DL partners, as I've talked about before, I mean, providing support is part of our business model. It's obviously how we work together with our franchisees when conditions outside of their control warrant support. But when we do that, it's always, as you know, targeted and temporary and designed, obviously, to go to owner-operators or partners who are most in need. I think as Chris said, we've got some incredibly strong partners in the Middle East, the majority of those partners have been with us for 20 years or more. We've worked through a variety of challenges over the years. And I think we'll continue to be focused on supporting our team members in the region, working with the communities that we do business in and working closely with the DL partners to get through this together. And I'm very, very confident that we'll do that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hi. Thanks for the question. I'm wondering maybe if you could comment on China specifically. I know it's not a huge part of your profit today, but you do have some big growth aspirations in that country. So if you could comment on some of the macro challenges that you're seeing and how they're impacting results in that country? And maybe talk about how the brand is positioned to gain share in that market. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, overall, we had a very good 2023 in China. We were happy with how our business performed in China. We're seeing strong growth there. We also built 1,000 restaurants in China. So we're very much on track from our development aspirations and we would expect to do something similar in 2024 from that standpoint. So overall headline is feel good about what we're seeing in China and the progress in growth. Certainly, in China, as you've read about and seen it with a number of other companies, consumer sentiment in the country is a little bit more under pressure right now. And that is leading to -- in Q4, in particular, we saw the environment get more promotional. We didn't necessarily follow that, but certainly the environment is getting more promotional. And our focus is on making sure that we remain competitive. So we're going to do what we need to do to maintain our competitiveness in that market. But if you think about the overall macro trends in China, I talked about this at Investor Day, we certainly think that we're going to continue to see good comp performance in that market as consumer wealth and GDP continue to grow mid-single digits. We think there's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to build out development and penetration in that market to many places where we don't really have McDonald's presence. So overall outlook on China for us continues to be very robust, which is why we increased our stake, as Ian mentioned.\nIan Borden: I might just add on a couple of things to Chris. I mean first, I would just acknowledge the team and our team in China, we opened just over 1,000 restaurants in 2023, which was an all-time high for us. And as Chris mentioned, as we talked about in our remarks, we completed the acquisition of the additional 28% to take our stake to 48% at the end of January. And I think we continue to remain really optimistic about the long-term opportunity there and our ability to have an increased stake in that long-term opportunity with that additional stake acquisition. And we're looking forward to getting that market to 10,000 restaurants by end of 2028, which is, I think, a really important milestone as we look forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe I'll just ask about the U.S. Are you willing to say kind of where pricing was in the fourth quarter and also into the first quarter? And also any color you can provide by daypart, I think we've heard some other companies talking more about late night or if you perhaps have any comments on breakfast recently?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, I'll kind of just give some macro comments. Again, have Ian pick any details. But certainly, we've continued to work through pricing in the U.S. as we were looking to offset inflation. We saw what I would describe as mid to high single-digit price increases last year. It depends a little bit on where you were in the country, but mid to high single-digit pricing. We are seeing, as I've talked about on prior calls, that particularly among the low-income consumer, there's some transaction size reduction that we're seeing. We're also seeing some trade down there. So that offset a little bit of the pricing -- the absolute pricing that we took. But I think as you think about 2024, certainly, inflation is going to be less, probably in the low single-digit inflation in 2024, and that will be consistent with where we end up on pricing. From a daypart standpoint, I'd say pretty balanced there. But breakfast continues to be a competitive area, a lot of activity going on in breakfast. Our business, as you know, is dominated around particularly lunch. That's our single biggest daypart and that daypart continues to do well. So nothing particularly noteworthy that I would say on dayparts, but Ian, maybe you have any other insights to share there.\nIan Borden: Yes. You, I think, covered all the bases, Chris, but maybe just a couple of builds. I mean, I think we did see overall pricing for the year just around 10%. But as Chris noted, in the fourth quarter that level of pricing came down, obviously, in line with inflation and was in that high single-digit range. I mean, I think we're continuing to see pretty consistent flow through with pricing, which I think is really important because it goes back to what I've spoken about before with just the tools and capabilities that we've put in place to make sure that when we are taking pricing, we're doing that in the most effective way possible. Obviously, as we head into 2024, knowing inflation has come down a fair bit from its peak. I think, as I said earlier, I think our pricing we certainly expect will come down roughly in line with that as we work through the year. We certainly know consumers are more weary or weary of pricing, and we're going to continue to be consumer led in our pricing decisions as we kind of look forward to 2024 and knowing that the environment will continue to be competitive. We'll be thoughtful together with our franchisees, obviously, who make those decisions in their own restaurants as we look forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks you. Chris, wanted to just follow up on some of the color you just gave on the U.S. consumer and then some of that lower-income consumer, I think, managing the check a little bit. Just curious if you could elaborate anything more there on the consumer in the U.S. And is that check management largely been consistent with what you've seen in recent quarters? Or are you seeing any of the incidents or intensity there, pick up some? And ultimately, what does that mean as you kind of think about promotions and the evolving value options that you talk about in the U.S. this year. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. I think consistent with what we talked about on the prior call, where you see the pressure with the U.S. consumer is that low-income consumer. So call it, $45,000 and under. That consumer is pressured. From an industry standpoint, we actually saw that cohort decrease in the most recent quarter, particularly I think as eating at home has become more affordable. There's been much less pricing that's been taken more recently on packaged food. So you're seeing that eating at home is becoming more affordable, that I think is putting some pressure from a IEO standpoint on that low-income consumer. If you think about middle income, high income, we're not seeing any real change in behavior with those. We continue to gain share with those groups. But the battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer. And I think what you're going to see as you head into 2024 is probably more attention to what I would describe as affordability. So think about that as being absolute price point being probably more important for that consumer in a lower absolute price point to get them into the restaurants than maybe a value message, which is a two for six or something like that. Those probably are going to resonate a little bit less in 2024, particularly we think in the front half with the consumer there may be something that's lower absolute price points. So that's -- we are set up well to be able to go after that. We have our D123 platform, as you know, and I think you're going to see probably some activity there in the U.S. at the local level to make sure we continue to provide good value for that low-income consumer.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask about G&A and it came in actually just below the 2.2% of system-wide sales you guided to, which is true despite the fact that I suspect that the system-wide sales were lower than you might have expected in the fourth quarter, given the implications in the Middle East. And so I was just curious to what extent are you able to flex your G&A? I know you usually guide to percentage of system-wide sales, but trying to understand whether sort of internally you actually forecast more along the time -- along lines of dollar spend? And are you seeing any of the -- any improvements perhaps because of Accelerating the Arches? I'm curious to what extent you have flex there.\nIan Borden: Sara, it's Ian. Let me take that one. Well, look, I think you've heard me talk about this before. But the way we think about G&A is kind of in two broad buckets. I mean, firstly, we want to continue to work to run our business as efficiently as we can. We know we've got some opportunities in that area. It's why I talked about in our upfront remarks that we're going to continue to invest in the areas where we think we have strategic opportunities to drive greater efficiency. A lot of that work is going to be led by the Global Business Services organization that we stood up and is driving these transformation efforts in area like HR, finance, tech and getting after spend opportunities in areas like indirect sourcing. So part of what we're focused on is continuing to make those strategic investments so that we can continue to drive greater efficiency in how we operate, which, if you go back to the principles of kind of accelerating the organization, which was really what that whole initiative was designed around was how do we get faster, how do we get more innovative and how do we get more efficient in how we're running the business. The second kind of broad area of G&A spend is obviously investing in the areas that we feel like we've got opportunity to drive growth and strong returns for the business. And part of running the business more efficiently is to make sure we have the resources available to invest behind the opportunities that we believe exist, and we continue to believe we've got significant opportunities. I think we've talked previously to the examples of kind of our tech platforms and digital capabilities where we continue to make significant investment. Those, I think, are really strong examples of the type of growth when you look at the growth mix that are coming from those investments and obviously continuing to drive strong returns for us, and we're going to continue, obviously, to invest behind those growth opportunity areas that we have. And so I think that's -- over time, as you kind of look forward, I do believe we'll continue to be able to gain leverage in G&A as a percentage of sales. But I think certainly in the short term, our focus is going to be in those areas that I highlighted.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChristopher Carril: Thanks. Good morning. So, just on McOpCo margins, I believe you mentioned you expect them to be relatively in line this year versus 2023. So can you expand maybe on some of the puts and takes around this outlook? Maybe any detail on U.S. versus IOM, your cost inflation outlook? And maybe finally, if and where you see opportunity for company margin upside? Thanks.\nIan Borden: Good morning, Chris. Let me take that. Yes, you're right. I think as you said, in our opening comments we talked about the fact that we think our 2024 company-operated margin percent will be roughly in line with where we ended for 2023. I mean, I think there are a few things that are going on, so I'll kind of talk about it, U.S. and then International. I mean I think in the U.S., if you look at kind of commodity inflation for 2024, we think that will be in the low single-digit range. I think wage inflation probably in the mid to higher single-digit range. Part of that is because of the impact of what we're going to have to work through in California, which I know you'll be aware of and the significant wage increases that come into effect there at the beginning of April. I think internationally, on the commodity side, again, I think we expect commodity inflation to be in that low single-digit range. Wage inflation probably in the low to mid-single-digit range. So obviously, we've still got kind of the current inflationary effects. And at the same time, we've got, obviously, carryover from much higher kind of inflation levels that we experienced as we work through 2023. So those are a bit of maybe kind of the -- kind of pressures. Obviously, you've heard us talk about what we think from a sales perspective. So obviously, we're going to get a lift as we continue to grow sales through 2024 landing kind of where I said. But I think we remain really confident that we can continue to drive leverage in margins as we look forward as some of these inflationary pressures begin to settle on a more consistent basis. And we're able to continue to grow sales, which we're obviously really, really confident in our ability to do that with the plans and strategies that we've got in place.\nMike Cieplak: We have time for one more question from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Just a follow-up. Given the modest pricing in 2024 in the U.S., do you expect positive traffic then? And then my actual question is on the digital side. Can you talk about any changes as it relates to your approach, specifically to value offers as you look ahead into 2024 in the U.S.? Have a lot of promotions on the app also driving higher ticket, frequency. So just -- to what extent is digital marketing accretive to franchisees? And just any thoughts there. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, as you know, we don't give traffic guidance. So we won't get into kind of a specific what do we expect to see in traffic. But I think it's fair to say that the success in this industry is always about having balance and you need to have both traffic growth and you need to have price growth. That's the long-term formula for success. So that's kind of what we use as our North Star. I think we're set up really well to have that kind of balance. As I look at our business around the world, our brand is in great shape. We are seeing some of our highest customer satisfaction scores around the world. We're seeing our operations in almost every single country around the world get better as we execute our Performance and Customer Excellence program or PACE, as you know it. I think globally, in Q4, we saw service times improve by 10 seconds. And we've got very good alignment with our franchisees. In most of our big markets, we're seeing healthy franchising cash flows. In the U.S., franchising cash flows were up roughly $35,000 last year despite all the price headwinds. So I think we're set up well as a business to have that balance right as part of our long-term focus.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call.

And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Over the past quarter, we've seen yet again the broad-based momentum across the McDonald's business despite continued headwinds and a challenging macro environment. Around the world, we're operating from a position of strength as the industry's market share leader. In Q3, we achieved comparable global sales of nearly 9%. As we expected and as we mentioned in prior earnings calls, our top line growth, while strong across each of our segments and at an elevated level versus historical norms, has continued to moderate. However, we continue to outpace our competitors, thanks to our system's outstanding execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy. Over the past year, we've been more intentional about sharing and scaling world-class ideas that drive impact globally. Central to our continued strength is how we maximize our marketing to stay relevant to customers. In August, we launched As Featured In, in over 100 markets, making it our largest global campaign to date. The campaign celebrates the most memorable McDonald's references across the world of entertainment with over 20 McDonald's integrations that span across Hollywood, Bollywood, anime and independent film. It's also another proof point of the impact and power that a One McDonald's Way approach to marketing can have to drive engagement, allowing our markets to remain globally consistent but locally relevant. Celebrating our core equities, As Featured In demonstrates that McDonald's and our iconic menu is a cultural touchstone that immediately connects fans to characters and stories with over 85% positive consumer sentiment and in the top 30% of campaigns for customer engagement. As I recently visited Australia and New Zealand, I was energized to see other examples of One McDonald's Way in action or One Macca's Way as our friends down under call it. It was clear that our continued menu discipline and reduced restaurant complexity across these markets is driving operational improvements. By creating a One Macca's Way approach to the crew experience by utilizing consistent comprehensive resources, we're creating a better customer experience as a result. Speaking of One McDonald's Way, Australia was our first market to launch Best Burger and with resounding success. Great-tasting burger perceptions continue to grow, and the Macca's team has reached an all-time high in beef burger share. And now Best Burger has been scaled to over 70 markets around the world, building on learnings from the original launch in Australia. Australia is also a good example of a market that has room to grow through new restaurant openings. We expand our footprint in the market from a position of strength. We're also enhancing existing restaurant capacity by introducing delivery rooms and integrated McCafe beverage cells that will allow us to better drive growth against our MCDs. We'll share more details on our plans related to the Fourth D development in December at our investor update. McDonald's reliability value and feel good experiences continue to play a key role in connecting to our customers, not just in Australia, but across all our markets, offering delicious food at an affordable price and at the convenience our customers have come to expect. It's promising that our markets continue to grow share despite the cost of living pressures. As we had expected early in the year and have talked about on prior earnings calls, it's clear that consumers continue to be more discriminating about what and where they spend. Between inflation remaining high, the elevated cost of fuel, interest rates, housing affordability pressures and more, consumers all over the world are having to pay more and more for everyday goods and services, proving time and time again in difficult economic times, the McDonald's brand and our positioning on value is an opportunity for us. Take Germany, for example. The team has delivered remarkable results with the launch of the McSmart menu earlier this year, offering smaller, more affordable meals. It's an incredible example of remaining agile and listening to our customers. Our German team heard from customers that they were creating these options, and McSmart made our menu more accessible to them, contributing to outperformance and value perceptions when compared to the rest of the industry. And it was an important driver of delivering Germany's 10th quarter of double-digit sales growth. We're always pushing ourselves to stay one step ahead of the customer as we have throughout our history by innovating and reinventing ourselves even as we're operating from a position of strength. McDonald's is one of those consumer brands that has the permission and power to be part of people's everyday lives. And one of the great things about McDonald's is that we don't rest on our laurels. We continue to find new ways to earn customer visits, and we believe the actions we've taken over the last several years have laid the foundation for our continued success. This starts with strong local leadership and franchisee alignment. When we combine that with a fully modernized estate, a globally recognized brand, delicious food on our core menu and a high level of execution across our 4 Ds, our competitive strength is on full display. And while the macro environment will remain uncertain, we believe our brand and our business are well positioned to win. This powerful combination of brand, physical advantages and digital penetration has positioned us as an industry leader. And as we continue to keep a constant pulse on what's top of mind for our customers, we believe that we'll maintain our leadership position and continue to connect our brand to consumers in a way that drives growth and momentum for the business. I remain confident in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the enduring strength of the McDonald's brand. I'll now turn it over to Ian.\nIan Borden: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Our third quarter results yet again demonstrate strong restaurant-level execution across our Accelerating the Arches growth pillars with significant increases in customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. Our restaurants are offering customers an affordable destination every day for delicious food and great service, driving nearly 9% global comp sales for the quarter. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our entire McDonald's system, the McDonald's brand remains stronger than ever. The resilience of our business is rooted in our ability to adapt to any environment. As expected, challenging macro dynamics continued this quarter and consumer spending remains pressured. And while top line growth has continued to moderate in line with our expectations, we're outperforming the industry, and we remain the leader in value and affordability perception across most of our largest markets. Providing affordable options for our customers has always been core to McDonald's success, and continuing to evolve these options as customer needs change remains critical. As Chris mentioned a few minutes ago, it's clear that our customers continue to seek reasonably priced meals as rising costs persist and our markets around the world continue to respond. Germany delivered its highest-ever monthly sales performance by focusing on the evolving needs of our customers amid increasing macro pressures. The market launched a [Your Remix, Your Deal] promotion exclusively in the app allowing customers to build their own small bundles. Beyond affordability, this promotion offered the personalization our customers are looking for and significantly increased customer engagement, which was evident in an additional 1 million 90-day active loyalty members in the third quarter. This approach of smaller, more affordable bundles featuring our core menu favorites was first highlighted earlier this year in Germany and the U.K. with the launch of new permanent value offerings and has since been adapted locally in other markets. In Canada, a highly competitive breakfast market, the team offered customers a more affordable option with the McMuffin and hot coffee pairing. By simply featuring our core products, at a compelling price point during a critical day part, we drove market share gains in both breakfast and coffee, demonstrating how providing customers, what they want at great value always resonates. The D123 Everyday Value Menu in the U.S. takes a similar approach to affordable bundles with nationally promoted products at locally relevant price points. The platform features products such as the McDouble or four-piece McNuggets. With a bundle offered at each day part, customers can visit McDonald's for an affordable meal no matter the time of day. And while prices have evolved over time, the featured products have remained the same, providing customers with their familiar favorites from our core menu. This consistency in our value offerings means customers know exactly what to expect every time they visit us, driving our strong position as the affordability leader in the market. And in China, with slowing macroeconomic conditions and historically low consumer sentiment, the market relaunched a campaign with small price-pointed bundles featuring our hot delicious burgers. Designed to engage our Gen Z consumers, this promotion drove meaningful customer demand and increased beef share in the market. Beyond the price of our food, we're continuing to provide customers with new experiences, further elevating their value perceptions. Many markets are using our digital app to drive engagement and increase loyalty participation with our fans, through exclusive activations. This was on display through recent MONOPOLY campaigns in several markets. Starting with Australia where MONOPOLY contributed to record digital sales in the market for the quarter, fueled by higher app registrations and increased game piece redemptions. And in the UK, MONOPOLY returned for the 17th consecutive year, featuring a double-peel option encouraging customers to scan their game pieces into the app. MONOPOLY once again ignited our fans' love of the brand and delivered higher levels of app engagement than ever before. Spain had similar success with their MONOPOLY promotion over the summer. Now leveraging the same app features as the U.K., the promotion delivered significant increases in both app downloads and registrations. This is another great example of sharing best bets across our system to fuel our digital growth ambitions. In fact, in our top six markets, digital sales represented more than 40% of system-wide sales, or nearly $9 billion for the third quarter. We now have over 57 million 90-day active members across these top markets, and our relationship with them continues to grow. We're learning when they visit, how they visit, and what they buy, with more and more of our sales coming through identified channels than ever before. By continuing to elevate the McDonald's digital experience, our customers feel more connected to the brand, driving those incremental visits that we believe would otherwise go uncaptured. And it gives us more ways to reunite with customers who haven't visited us in a while. Beyond MONOPOLY, the brand was at the center of our marketing, yet again this quarter, as we leveraged a One McDonald's Way approach to celebrating the FIFA Women's World Cup in July. With record-breaking viewership and fan engagement, our brand was part of a cultural moment, and we continued to elevate our creative excellence through a scalable, culturally relevant campaign. This came to life through global activations across 28 markets, tapping into local fan excitement, and was supported by a fully integrated social, digital streaming and content strategy. Even more exciting, we celebrated our restaurant teams, by sending crew members who go above and beyond to attend the live matches. Across the as featured in campaign, MONOPOLY activation and the FIFA Women's World Cup, I can't think of another time, when we better utilized our scale to leverage great marketing ideas across our system, which is a tangible demonstration of our accelerating the organization principles in practice. Our food is at the heart of our customer's relationship with the brand. This is why we're also taking a One McDonald's Way approach to our menu, further fueling our chicken ambition by scaling core chicken equities. Our McCrispy Chicken Sandwich continues to be an important driver of chicken share growth, having first launched in 2022 and now a $1 billion brand across multiple markets. McCrispy was the most recently launched in Australia this quarter, where early results indicate a lift to chicken category sales while bringing a renewed focus to our chicken portfolio. The U.K. continued to drive excitement in chicken by creating fresh takes on our new global favorites. This past quarter, the market featured a new line extension, McCrispy Deluxe, offered alongside the McCrispy and the McSpicy in the market. By combining strong execution of our core menu offerings, with new flavor news and limited additional complexity, we continue to strengthen our chicken credibility with customers and maintain our market share leadership in the chicken category. Across each of our Accelerating the Arches growth pillars, it is clear that our playbook is working. Thanks to the resilience of our system and the strong execution across the M, Cs and Ds, we're staying relevant to our customers as their needs continue to change. Turning to the P&L. Our strong top line performance drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.19 for the quarter. This is an increase over the prior year of 16% in constant currencies, excluding current year charges primarily related to accelerating the organization restructuring costs. Our company-operated margin performance remains pressured by continued cost inflation, in line with our expectations. We expect these macro headwinds will continue in the fourth quarter. Strong franchise sales performance continues to be partially offset by targeted and temporary franchisee assistance, provided mainly to our European franchisees where elevated costs continue to pressure restaurant cash flows. We're still anticipating that these efforts will have an impact of $100 million to $150 million on our full year results. Total restaurant margin dollars grew by about $335 million in constant currencies or about 10% for the quarter. G&A for the quarter increased 1% in constant currency, and our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was nearly 21%. Adjusted year-to-date operating margin is 47.5%, driven by our strong top line growth. For the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be about 47%, including an expected property gain in other operating income in the fourth quarter, and G&A of about 2.2% of system-wide sales. Foreign currency translation positively impacted third quarter results by about $0.08 per share with a slight tailwind expected - for the full year. As I wrap up, I want to touch on the recent dividend increase approved by our Board of Directors in early October. This marks our second consecutive annual increase of 10%, and we're extremely proud of our track record of delivering meaningful cash return to shareholders, marked by our 47th consecutive dividend increase. This demonstrates our confidence in the Accelerating the Arches strategy and our commitment to a long-term growth for the system and our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more with you at our investor update in December. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. As we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment, what remains unwavering is our commitment to creating an environment where the entire McDonald's system thrives together. Through our Accelerating the Arches strategy, we've acquired an industry-leading digital loyalty base that complements our restaurant footprint. We're retaining top talent who are passionate about the McDonald's brand. Our restaurant teams are executing at a high level, customer satisfaction is increasing and we continue to attract, the best franchisees in the world as a franchisor of choice. Despite ongoing legislative and regulatory headwinds, we are committed to mobilizing our system to protect franchisee decision-making at a local level and on building a long-term presence in civic spaces to advocate for policies that benefit local restaurant owners and the communities they serve. We're also fulfilling our purpose of feeding and fostering community. In September, we hosted our second global volunteer month where over 6,400 volunteers across 12 markets spent an estimated 26,000 hours giving back to local communities. And at the beginning of October, McDonald's was named to Fast Company's list of brands that matter for a company whose work is moving the needle on critical issues and that display the highest level of commitment to their purpose and values. While our strategy is working, our customers continue to expect even more of us, and we're prepared to meet that challenge. What Ray Kroc said in 1967 still stands true today. We are living in a rapidly changing world, so McDonald's will change with it. Change is our only constant. As was the case for those who came before us who built McDonald's into the global leader it is today, we will earn our success, and together as a system, we will lay the foundation for our future. And on Wednesday, December 6, I hope you'll join us to hear more at our investor update as we look to the growth potential that lies ahead and share our plans for the future. It makes me excited to think about what the next 5 to 10 years will bring for McDonald's. We believe that because we're operating from a position of strength with a strategy that continues to deliver, we now have the opportunity, the ability and the obligation to reimagine our brand for the future. I look forward to seeing you in Chicago this December, and now I'll hand it over to Mike for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you very much. Obviously, value, a big focus on this call. And I wanted to ask, I guess, the focus on value in the context of recent average ticket increases for you and really across the sector, much of which driven by premiumization, customization, larger sizes, what have you, in other words, pricing increases in average ticket beyond just that of price. So as we talk about value, what does that mean to future price increases? And is there an intention to do value a particular bundled value to where the average ticket can be protected? Or would you sacrifice some average ticket in order to get future market share gains and presumably transaction gains? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, John. And on value, I think it's always a focus at McDonald's. I mean we're a business built on value and convenience with great-tasting food. So we're always keen to focus on value. I think certainly given the inflation that the market has experienced, that we've experienced over the last year, really more than the year, we've tried to be very choiceful and disciplined on how we have executed those price increases. And the good news is we continue to lead on affordability. We continue to lead on value for money. We've seen no deterioration in our advantages there. We are holding those up. How we do it varies by market. So I wouldn't give you a generalized statement about how we approach value. It's up to each individual market to think about how they continue to deliver the customer great value. But I can tell you, on every single major market that we look at, the teams are doing a great job on value. They're delivering against it. And we're seeing really no change at all in terms of customer acceptance pass-through on pricing, which to me is also an indication that the teams are striking the right balance.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. And thanks for the color on the marketing initiatives in the IOM countries. And it does sound like there's a bit more focus on value, but I'd love to hear how trends might be settling out in these big IOM countries, the big five, so to speak, in the post-COVID mobility recovery world, in other words, maybe back-to-school might be a good way to look at that. As you get past the tourism boost of the summer, maybe you're getting a sense of what type of comps we should be expecting for these IOM markets. So any color about the type of consumer environment you're seeing in these markets, how same-store sales trends really exited the quarter would be very helpful.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, David. I'll start at a high level and then hand it over to Ian to give you any more texture on that. But at a high level, we continue to be very pleased with how our IOM business is performing. We're seeing, whether you look on the quarter, the year or a four year stack, this business is continuing to perform very well overall. We're also seeing that there's great execution. We're seeing customer satisfaction scores increasing in almost all of our major IOM markets. So overall, we feel good. In Europe and, in particular, we've certainly seen more inflation in Europe. And so the team there has had to be probably even more laser-focused on making sure that we deliver great value. But the business overall, not seeing any big change quarter-to-quarter in terms of how it's performing, but I'll give it over to Ian to give you some more texture.\nIan Borden: David, yes, just maybe a couple of builds to what Chris mentioned. I mean, again, I think if you look at the comps for the quarter across IOM at 8.3%, that's a pretty strong indication of the consistency and fundamental underlying momentum that we've got in the segment. We had positive traffic growth in the segment, which I think is an indication of how that momentum is, obviously, from a sales and traffic perspective. And we're continuing to grow market share across the majority of those large markets, which tells us despite, as Chris talked to some of the different macro or consumer environments in those markets, which are obviously varied, obviously, some of those markets, there's a fair bit of pressure. From a macro headwind or consumer headwind, we're continuing to do well versus the landscapes around us. I mean I think we have spoken, and you heard it in our opening remarks, around the expectation that we're going to continue to see moderation in that top line as inflation levels continue to come down and, obviously, pricing comes down in line with that. But I think we're in a really good spot, and I think that just speaks to how our strategic plan around Accelerating the Arches continues to resonate with consumers consistently across the business.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question is on the cost side. I think you lowered your SG&A outlook, at least as a percentage of system sales versus what you had given us last time. And I was just wondering, what changed in that outlook? Is it a matter of some of the savings and accelerating the organizations coming through or delays in investment spending? I guess any context you could give us on that front would be helpful. Thank you.\nIan Borden: Good morning, David. Ian, obviously. So let me try and give you some color there. I mean I think as we said in our guidance at the beginning of the year, we expected G&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 2.2 to 2.3. And obviously, we've updated that to say more about 2.2. So it's come down marginally. I think obviously, we've had some really strong top line results this year. So obviously, that's a partial element of the benefits. And I think the other part is just timing of spend. I mean we are kind of a back half weighted spend cycle within the business. I think fourth quarter, more pronounced from a quarterly standpoint. So we do expect to hire level of spending as we get into the fourth quarter. But I think just there's a timing element of just kind of how the investments that we're making, I talked about kind of two areas on our last quarterly call where we continue to invest. One is behind technology and digital, which we believe are - continue to provide strong opportunities for growth, and we're going to continue to invest when we have those opportunities. I think we've got a pretty strong track record in how those investments are delivering for the business. The other area is around our global business service organization, which we stood up earlier this year as part of Accelerating the Organization. We spent a lot of time over the last six months or so looking at what we believe the opportunities are for the business there. And I think we've got good line of sight into some things that we think can drive kind of sustainable efficiencies from an operational perspective as we go forward. And we're certainly investing now behind some of those areas of opportunities. So what I would call it a little bit more of kind of the timing of spend around those initiatives and more of a focus in the first half of the year on kind of bringing our ATO organizational changes to life.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just focused on the U.S. consumer, I'm just wondering if you talk about any change in behavior, whether there was a change in trend through the quarter or more recently into the fourth quarter. I was wondering if there's pressure in some areas, maybe benefit from trade down and others. Otherwise, you mentioned in the release, I think that the U.S. comp was driven by strategic menu pricing, no mention of the traffic. So, I'm just wondering if you can maybe give a breakdown of that U.S. comp components, whether the lack of traffic growth is a concern looking at '24. How you think about those components within that U.S. comp? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff, and I'll answer, and then if Ian has anything else he wants to pick up on this. But specific to the U.S., we've been talking about how the consumer is more discriminating, because of all the price pressures that they're facing as well as interest rates, things like that. What you end up seeing, is that the pressure is felt more on the lower-income consumer. And so, one of the things that we saw industry-wide is that, that low-income consumer, which we would say is $45,000 and under, was negative from an industry standpoint. If you zoom out and you think about our performance relative to that, we continue to have, on the full year basis, traffic growth. We had a slight dip in traffic. We went slightly negative in Q3. We expected that because of what we were lapping. But if you look at us on a two-year stack in the quarter, our traffic is up strongly. So, I think we're just going to need to continue to keep a close eye on that $45,000 and under consumer, because of the pressure that they're feeling there and make sure that we're offering value, but hopefully, the industry stays disciplined as well on pricing.\nIan Borden: Maybe just - I'll just add a bit of a build to Chris' commentary, which certainly hit the headlines, but just maybe, because I think the texture is really important in the quarter. I mean I think the headline would be on an overall basis that we maintained our QSR traffic market share in the quarter. I think we continue to see really strong share gains in both beef and chicken being the kind of two key elements of the category. We continue to gain share with both the middle- and higher-income consumers, and that speaks a little bit, Jeff, to what you called out, which is that we're certainly partly benefiting from the trade down from more expensive alternatives within those kind of income or segment levels. We held share with the lower-income consumer in a pretty competitive marketplace. But I think the headline, is that the comparable, as Chris talked about, industry traffic was down in the quarter as it has been for the last couple of quarters. And so, our comparable traffic was marginally down as a result of that. And I think just - I think I just would want to highlight, I think, the strength of our top line performance overall through our comp sales, which remain industry-leading. As you've seen and what we've announced for this quarter. And I think that's a combination of our strategic strengths coming together, which we've been working on over the last couple of years. We've got a fully modernized estate. We've got a digital platform that's coming to life at scale that's allowing us to really interact with our consumers on a much more individual basis. Our marketing execution, which I think has really been elevated and is resonating in a more culturally relevant way with our consumers. And then, we just call out, I think, and this is really specific to the U.S. business, the outstanding execution our whole system is delivering. We know, we're delivering a better experience for customers. We know we're better staffed. And as Chris talked about earlier, we know we've got a leading position on value for money and affordability. And so, I think as a result of all of that, we certainly believe we continue to be in an advantaged position as we continue to kind of lean into these macro headwinds that we're obviously having to navigate.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hi. And thanks for the comment on traffic. And I'm wondering if you could expand on the pricing discussion. I think last quarter, you said you expected pricing to be in the double-digits for the year. So maybe you can comment on what that might imply for the fourth quarter. And perhaps you can give us an early look on what we should expect for 2024, whether that - would be that you expect price to be a little bit more normalized than what we've seen in the last few years? Thanks.\nIan Borden: Good morning Eric, it's Ian. So let me talk a little bit about pricing. And obviously, this is specific to the U.S., because obviously, pricing varies across markets, depending on the context in the individual marketplace. I think as I talked about last quarter, certainly continue to believe that our average pricing level in the U.S. business for the full year will be just over 10%. I think what we did see in quarter three, and this is the first time now in a number of quarters, is that our average pricing level has started to come down in terms of the rate of increase. I think that speaks to the fact, as we've spoken to before, that inflation is starting to come down. And of course, we expect pricing to come down kind of in line with how inflation is coming down. I think as we've talked about before, our U.S. business has been really disciplined in how they have continued to take pricing. We've put a lot of effort in over the last couple of years to, I think, the data and analytical capability that comes from our third-party advisers, who obviously make pricing recommendations to our business, including our franchisees, who obviously make their own pricing decisions. And I think the fact that we continue to maintain that leadership position in both value for money and affordability speaks to the fact that even though we've obviously had elevated pricing levels on the back of elevated cost and inflationary pressures, that we have been able to execute that in a way that has minimized, the resistance from the customer and maximize the flow-through that we're getting as a result of those price increases. And I would say our flow-through, continues to kind of be in line with historical norms, which I think speaks to the capability and the position that we've been able to deliver with pricing. So again, I think we've talked about moderation. I think part of that will be pricing if inflation continues to kind of come down as we look forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. I wanted to just ask a bit more on how you're thinking about maintaining that underlying momentum and share gains in the U.S. As you think about some of the key drivers in place across the 3Ds, the operational execution that you're speaking to value the Ready on Arrival, Best Burger, et cetera. Chris, can you sort of impact latest thoughts on some of the most impactful traffic and sales opportunities into next year and even beyond? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Great. Well, thanks for the question. I guess I'd start with I look forward to seeing you at December 6, this we'll get into a lot more in that about how we see the outlook for next year and some of the specific things that, we've got planned to continue to drive the business. But I would say, broadly, we think our strategy - our Accelerating the Arches strategy still has a lot of runway in it. Each of the growth pillars, the marketing core menu and 4Ds, we think that there's still a lot more that we can do underneath each of those. Again, we'll be more specific about what that is on December 6. And then if you think about more broadly, what's happening right now is this business is starting to amass on the digital side some pretty significant scale. And the scale that we're building on the digital side opens up a lot of opportunities that we think, quite honestly, are going to be difficult for our competitors to match. And so, when you take our physical presence, having more restaurants in the U.S. than anyone else, our digital presence, which is bigger than anybody else in the U.S., along with great execution, which we're seeing with strong consumer satisfaction scores, our service times are down roughly nine seconds in the quarter. They're down slightly less than that, but still down, I think, about seven seconds on the full year, we're in a really strong position in the U.S. to continue the growth that we've got.\nIan Borden: Maybe one just small build, Dennis, and I'll be a bit of a broken record on this, but I just -- I wouldn't underestimate some of those things that we've done over the last couple of years like the fully modernized estate. I mean imagine -- and this is the situation that some of our competitors are in today that you're trying to do that today in an environment of pressured cash flows and higher interest rates. I mean, we've got a fully modernized estate. As Chris talked about, we've got a modernized digital platform that continues to grow. And I think that's fundamentally some of the significant investments that we've made have been critically important as we head into this more kind of macro headwind and volatility.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, just one thing, Ian said that triggered as well, I thought, which is being able to drive the business, we need our franchisees to be in a strong position. And franchisee cash flow in the U.S. is up this year. We're up in the quarter. So, I think that just goes to sentiment. It's much more challenging, as you would imagine, to continue to drive the business if the franchisees are not seeing it flow through. And fortunately for us, we're seeing good flow-through for our franchisees despite having to absorb quite a bit of inflation both on the food and paper side as well as on the labor side. So that's another thing that gives us confidence as we head into the New Year.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Appreciate it. So, I just want to follow-up on the commentary regarding the competitive environment. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the promotional environment? Any uptick in discounting across the industry - and how might your approach to value change if the consumer gets weaker? And then I guess related, any color on same-store sales across different dayparts or any competitive - greater competitive activity in certain dayparts? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, I'll take the overall in terms of the competitive landscape, and I'll let Ian speak specifically to the daypart question. But overall, I think what you're seeing there is everybody is looking to make sure that they are competitive from a value standpoint with the consumer. And particularly, I talked about earlier, that low-income consumer, which I would say is, let's call that in this particular instance $45,000 and under, that part of the business, we're seeing traffic in the quarter was down. There is a step-up that we're seeing in some promotional activity by some of our competitors, but nothing alarming on that. Nothing that I'd say is looking to be, what we would say is beyond prudent. So, we're going to just continue to monitor it. We are focused on maintaining, our value leadership, and we're going to do, what we need to do to maintain our value leadership. But I think, we've also got lots of things that go into value. It goes beyond just price. It incorporates delivering a better customer experience, which we're doing through faster service times, improved hospitality. It goes to doing through that through a modernized estate, which we've got that is not something true across the rest of the industry. And we're seeing great execution, which means consumers are getting hotter, faster, better tasting food. So, all those things go into value perception, which is why we're seeing our value perception, hold up in the industry despite some of these pressures. So, I don't foresee any big changes there, but certainly, everybody is paying attention to that. For the specific date parts, I'll let Ian talk about that a little bit more.\nIan Borden: Good morning, Lauren, I just - maybe on the build on the dayparts, and again, I'm using the U.S. as the specific context is we've had pretty strong and consistent performance across all the dayparts in the business. So I don't think there's a 1 day part that I would call out where we aren't seeing strong performance. I do think, as we've seen kind of, I'll call it, a bit of a more return to work and return to office routine, there's probably a little bit more pressure in the breakfast daypart, just as some of those competitors who've been further behind in recovery, are kind of coming to life in that category. But again, we're continuing to see good performance there. And maybe the only other build, and this was an international lens on value, is you've heard us speak to some of the, I would call it, adjustments that some of our international markets have made to value. Maybe one I would just call out is in Canada, where the team there put a morning offer in place, which was a McMuffin and coffee pairing breakfast in Canada, is a pretty important daypart. Coffee is a pretty important part of that daypart. And so, I think our markets are going to continue to front footed and proactively make sure that we're adjusting value. So it's relevant to what our consumers are looking for as the context continues to evolve. And value, as Chris talked about, is a strategic part of our fundamental business model, but we are obviously going to continue to listen to our customers and make sure we're delivering what they need and what they expect from us.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning. As it relates to the U.S. company-owned restaurant margins, they expanded this quarter for the first time in two years, albeit modestly, but a good indication of maybe your franchise store level margins as well. What was the biggest driver of this? Was it simply easing food cost inflation against still strong pricing? Or was there anything else to point to? And could this be a potential turning point for restaurant margin stabilization in the U.S. or maybe even perhaps some expansion moving forward?\nIan Borden: Good morning Brian, yes, thanks for the question. Look, I think what I would say on company-operated restaurant margins, we've been pretty consistent in -- if you look at the full year 2023, we expect company-operated margin percent both in the U.S. and IOM to be in line roughly with where we landed in quarter 4, 2022. I think that view hasn't changed. Obviously, we've had really strong sales performance this year, which is helping. And I think as you've heard me talk about before, the only way you sustainably work through periods of higher inflation in the business is obviously to continue to grow the top line and deliver strong performance. And that's what we're focused on. And we're obviously very confident as we're able to continue to do that that we're going to be able to kind of see improved restaurant margin from a percentage basis performance. In addition, obviously, to the really strong dollar growth that we're seeing on the back of those strong top line sales. So, I think no change to what we expect for the full year this year. But I think, we feel like we're in a really good position with the momentum we've got across the business.\nChris Kempczinski: The other thing that I would just add on the [Macacos] side, but it's also something that we've seen with franchisees is they're experiencing these gains even though roster sizes are growing. And I think part of the benefit that we're seeing is turnover is down. So, we're - even as we're expanding roster sizes in our Macacos restaurants, the team has done a really nice job, and we're seeing turnover levels down pretty significantly from prior year. And all of that has benefits of what - associated with it, of course, you have less training, but you also have improved execution. So, I think that's one thing that we're seeing that also is to extend, out to franchisees, franchisees, roster sizes are up versus last year. Applications are up significantly. So, I do think to this question about is something turning, on the labor side in the U.S. We're definitely seeing a turn there to the positive in terms, of having our restaurants fully staffed and having lower turnover as a result of that.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. You commented sort of on the U.S. side, but just within IOM and IDL same-store sales, wondering if you had any comments on kind of the check versus traffic component. And then also just within the U.S., I was curious if you had a sense for roughly how much your California franchisees will be seeing wages go up and how much pricing that might presumably take to offset that?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. I'll cover just the California question, and then Ian can cover the rest of what you laid out, specifically around IOM. But as you mentioned and noted, California, with the passage of the recent legislation, there around what that's going to do to wages, there is going to be a wage impact for our California franchisees. I don't think at this point, we can say exactly how much of that is going to work its way through pricing. Certainly, there's going to be some element of that that does need, to be worked through with higher pricing. There's also going to be things that I know the franchisees and our teams there are going to be looking around productivity. How all of that plays out, there will certainly be a hit in the short-term, to franchisee cash flow in California, up to know exactly what that hit will be because of some of the mitigation efforts. But there will be a hit. Longer term, what we've been talking about with our franchisees is this is an opportunity for us to gain share, because this is an impact that's going to hit all of our competitors. We're in a better position. We believe we're in a better position than our competitors to weather this. And so let's use this as an opportunity to actually accelerate our growth in California and accelerating our growth along with some mitigation. The two of those in combination is the best way to minimize any impact long term on franchisee cash flow. With that, on California, let me have Ian just cover the rest of your questions on IOM.\nIan Borden: Yes. Good morning, Brian. So let me try and give you a bit of texture on kind of IOM and IDL, I mean I think you've obviously seen the headline comp numbers for the quarter, which I think are obviously really strong. And I would say that the consistency is the broad based and I think consistency of the momentum we're seeing, which just goes back to what we've talked about earlier today, which is our Accelerating the Arches strategy continues to really deliver pretty consistent results across the business. I mean, of course, when there are 100-plus markets, there are always a couple of markets that are maybe dealing with more kind of headwinds than others. I mean, I think in IOM, France would certainly be one of those markets. We spoke a little bit about that on the quarter two call. But I think if you look at the IEO sector in France still hasn't recovered back to where it was in 2019. I mean we have generally been taking share in the marketplace, but I think the consumer sentiment, with everything that's going on, which is consistent, obviously, across all markets, higher inflation, higher interest rates. And then I think in France, as we worked through the summer, you saw a level of social unrest. You saw some kind of violent activity coming out of that social unrest. I think that's all kind of dampened consumer demand. So I think our team in France is really, really focused on having good clarity on what we need to continue to do, and we're going to continue to deliver even in that more difficult environment. But broadly speaking, consistently really strong and consistent performance across the business that we're very, very pleased with.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Citi.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First clarification and then a question. Ian, could you provide potential range of the size of the property gain in the fourth quarter? And then second, I'm just curious to gain your thoughts on the recent NLRB ruling that's to be implemented, I believe, in December. And how you think this might influence your own business or that of the industry in the years ahead?\nIan Borden: Jon, it's Ian. Let me take the first one, and then I'll turn it over to Chris on the NRLB. On the property gain, which is in our IOM segment, we expect that to be about $60 million. I think we've - you've probably heard us talk before, we get these kind of high-value individual properties that sometimes the highest and best use is different than what we're using it for today. This is an example of that. I don't think we certainly expect these are going to be occurring very often, but this is a case where that was just a good business decision to make, and that's what we're expecting in quarter four on that.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. And on the NLRB ruling, I mean, as you would expect, we strongly object to the last week's NLRB ruling. We think it's going to undermine small business ownership in the U.S. If you think about it, the franchise business model, it's really a great American innovation. It's created wealth for thousands, particularly underrepresent minorities and women. And this is something we think that needs to be supported, not attacked. And so in our mind, this is yet another example of agency overreach coming out of D.C. And we expect it's going to be contested. It's going to be contested in the courts. It's going to be contested in Congress. In fact, you may have seen already the Senate has, as indicated, they're going to seek to pass the continuing resolution, which is an opposition to this ruling. So McDonald's certainly opposes it. We're going to support others who oppose it. How it all plays out in time, I think it's tough to say, but this is something that's going to affect everybody. And as we've shown throughout time, so long as there's a level playing field and McDonald's is on the same level as everybody else, we tend to win. And so even if this NLRB ruling were to pass, it's going to affect the industry at large, and we think we're better positioned than anybody else to withstand it.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAndrew Barish: Good morning. Just shifting gears to IOM for a moment. Can you give us roughly how much of the $100 million to $150 million in subsidies has shown up so far? And then on the company-owned margin question, but related to IOM, I mean, this used to be 20% margin business, obviously, more pricing in the business today. Any thoughts longer term about kind of realizing back to 20% restaurant level margins in this segment?\nIan Borden: Good morning, Andy, it's Ian. So I think on the subsidies, I guess the headline would be we expect to spend in line with what we've said consistently for the year, $100 million to $150 million. And so I think we're tracking in line with that where you'd expect us to be at this point in the year is what I would say on that. I think in terms of longer-term margins, I mean, if you go back over our 60-year history, I mean we've had obviously many periods of higher inflation that we've had to work through over time. We've always been able to kind of get margins back as we're able to continue to drive strong top line growth. And I certainly don't see any reason why that would be different this time. I mean I think we have - we're going to make sure, as you've heard us talk about today, that we stay really disciplined in how we're pricing to the consumer. We feel we've got a lot of capability, data and analytical capability that's allowing us to do that better than most. And we also have industry-leading momentum as you continue to see in our results. And if you are able to have industry-leading momentum, and as you heard Chris talk about, you continue to invest in those structural advantages, whether that's the fully modernized estate, digital platforms at scale, obviously, you're going to be in an advantaged position versus others and how you can kind of continue to let that flow through the business. And I think that's certainly what we expect as we look forward on margins and the ability to kind of build those as we continue.\nMike Cieplak: We have time for one more question, Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler.\nBrian Mullan: Thank you. Just a question on development specific to the U.S. Can you perhaps comment on the takeaway only location in Texas. Any early learnings you've had thus far? I imagine we might hear more about this at the Investor Day, but just high level, do you expect new formats have the potential to play a more meaningful role in future U.S. unit growth?\nChris Kempczinski: So you're right, we will talk a little bit more about this actually a lot more about this when we get together on December 6. We're continuing to follow and assess the test that we have down in Texas. I think you can say that certainly there is going to be an opportunity for us to have restaurants that are smaller footprint that don't have a dining room. You will see some of those. But I think from a development standpoint, the vast majority of the development opportunity that we see is for our traditional restaurants. We think that there's still quite a bit of opportunity for traditional restaurants. That will be the bulk of it. You might see, again, something around the edges, which is some of the smaller formats, but the big idea is traditional restaurants that we'll talk more about on December 6.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. That completes our call today. Thanks, everyone, for joining.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-27 13:14:10", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Second Quarter 2023 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our Website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then reenter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our Web site. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Last quarter, I talked about consistency, consistency in our numbers, consistency in the drivers of our business and consistency in the excitement across the system about the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the theme is -- well, if I'm being honest, the theme was Grimace. I mean, Grimace has been everywhere the past few months, all over the news and more than 3 billion views on TikTok. Not bad for a 52nd birthday. This viral phenomenon is yet another proof point of the power of marketing at McDonald's today. Aside from Grimace, what really stood out about this past quarter was our continued consistency. In Q2, we delivered yet another quarter of strong performance, achieving global comparable sales of 11.7% with double digit comparable sales across each of our segments. We're operating from a position of strength and continuing to gain share in most of our major markets despite headwinds and a challenging macro environment. The reason for this continued consistency is simple, our Accelerating the Arches playbook is working to help create a better customer experience. Renewed focus on the fundamentals, in part fueled by the reintroduction of the PACE program, has led to operational improvements and continued increases in customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. To further strengthen our foundation of running great restaurants, we recently created a Chief Restaurant Officer role in markets to keep our market teams focused on driving our strategic plan, execution and performance. Market CROs will also help ensure that innovative ideas generated in local restaurants can be leveraged in markets across the globe. Our success is fueling even greater ambitions. We're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while evolving our strategy through accelerating the organization to stay front footed with an eye towards the future. As we've previously shared, accelerating the organization is an initiative to reimagine how we work to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences together to come up with the best solutions that can be scaled. We're bringing this to life through One McDonald's Way, horizontal ways of working and digitizing the organization. While we're just beginning to change our ways of working, we're already seeing early benefits. I've often said that the next great solution will come from our markets and in our restaurants. As I recently visited markets like China, Italy and Germany, I continue to be inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our system and how market teams are embracing these principles even more consistently. Visiting China truly brought to life the power of a highly digitized economy and our potential for global growth moving forward. With about 90% of our business currently coming through digital channels in that market, it was remarkable to see how the market has forged digital relationships with customers. China is also making tremendous progress in running the restaurants more efficiently, all with the use of data and technology. This will provide great learnings for the rest of our system. Our Canadian team is implementing a rigorous initiative review process to relentlessly prioritize work to actively stop projects that are less important and focus on solving the most meaningful problems for our customers. Using a new framework, the team has already cut their number of key business projects in half. We intend to learn from and scale this process to other markets as well. Additionally, our UK and Ireland team recently traveled to Germany to learn best practices from the market's best burger rollout. This is a prime example of the agile scaling of solutions and horizontal ways of working. And finally, last November, we launched our largest globally unified marketing campaign ever, Wanna Go to McDonald's, to celebrate the FIFA Men's World Cup. We're thrilled to extend this award winning brand platform with the FIFA Women's World Cup and write a new chapter in the story to meet this iconic cultural moment. This campaign will be brought to life in 28 markets through fully integrated social, digital streaming and content strategies that tap into local fan excitement. These are just a few examples of how a One McDonald's Way approach to common challenges will drive greater connectivity and efficiency worldwide. Key to enabling the company's scale solutions with speed and agility is the work of our new Global Business Services business unit, or GBS. GBS will unlock further efficiencies and capabilities of our people and resources. We will do this by developing digital tools for the organization, making data and insights more accessible across the system and growing our future talent pipeline. We'll continue to keep you updated on how our ongoing investment in this area will benefit the enterprise in the years to come. In addition to our accelerating the organization efforts, we're also focused on evolving our approach to capturing incremental customer visits. Central to that is restaurant development, also known as our fourth D. Our strong performance and strength of our brand has earned us the right to begin accelerating the pace of restaurant openings in our major markets over the next several years. While our primary focus is on opening traditional units, we are always testing and learning new ways to meet the needs of our customers. One example is the takeaway only restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas that opened in 2022. The restaurant site is considerably smaller than a traditional restaurant and as the way customers order and receive their food has changed dramatically over the past few years is geared toward customers based on their need state wherever they are. Another recent example of innovation I was able to see firsthand during my visit to China is the use of food lockers at busy locations with high in-store traffic. Upon arrival, delivery couriers can quickly unlock the designated locker and grab the customer's order without even entering the restaurant, removing friction for both the kitchen and the courier. And our new business ventures team is in the process of developing a new concept we will call [CosMc's], which we will test in a small handful of sites in a limited geography beginning early next year. [CosMc's] is a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald's but its own unique personality. We look forward to providing you with more information about our development plans and new format innovations at our Investor Day at the end of the year. Finally, before I hand it to Ian, I want to recognize our teams and business partners in France who have handled the unrest in the market with remarkable strength and grace. It has been extremely disruptive to the business on top of an already challenging operating environment. Thanks to everyone connected to McDonald's brands for your dedication and commitment to the business as well as your efforts to keep everyone safe during this volatile time. I'll now turn it over to Ian.\nIan Borden: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, the second quarter was yet another demonstration of consistently strong performance, guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy and fueled by our outstanding execution. We're delivering delicious feel good moments to our customers in new and exciting ways by doubling down on our creative excellence and highlighting our core menu, all with the value and convenience our customers expect. Our performance speaks for itself and is a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire McDonald's system. With global comparable sales of 11.7% and consistent performance across our segments, it's clear that the McDonald's brand has never been stronger. In fact, the brand was at the center this quarter as we engage with customers in authentic and culturally relevant ways with campaigns rooted in consumer insights. As Chris touched on a few minutes ago, we took the nostalgic experience of celebrating birthdays at McDonald's and repackaged it for a new generation with none other than Grimace at the center. It quickly became one of our most socially engaging campaigns of all time with millions of reactions on our social media posts, a true demonstration of how the power of our brand emerges in organic and creative ways in our fans. It contributed to the strong double digit comparable sales growth for the quarter in the US. The passion for the brand was also evident in Italy with the launch of a truly unique creative platform. It celebrated the most loved and best selling beef burger in the market by asking customers, what would you do for a crispy McBacon? The answer came in the form of customers getting tattoos of their favorite McDonald's sandwich, driving brand affinity and elevating share gains. I've certainly seen a lot in my 30 years at McDonald's but this was a new one for me. Truly remarkable. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, our chicken equities remain at the core of our growth strategy. The UK celebrated the 40th anniversary of another fan favorite, the Chicken McNuggets, by offering limited time sauces to reconnect with the Gen Z consumer. This was coupled with compelling media that showcased the fan truth that sharing your nuggets isn't guaranteed, even if your best friends. China also highlighted the Chicken McNuggets anniversary in a creative way with an integrated marketing campaign. Featuring our 20-piece nuggets, it quickly went viral on social media and generated significant positive buzz among consumers. Spicy McNuggets, one of our most popular line extensions, were offered across various markets this quarter, including Australia and Germany. It is yet another example of how we modernize our core menu, adapt it to meet changing customer taste profiles and scale these new ideas across the globe. Both markets achieved significant lifts to the McNuggets line as a result and Spicy McNugget sales reached an all time high in Australia. Our ambition on chicken includes further scaling emerging equities across markets. The McCrispy Chicken Sandwich, for example, has now scaled to over 10 of our largest markets, including Spain just this past quarter. The sandwich is already resonating with our customers, bringing attention to our chicken portfolio and driving significant chicken share gains. A recent addition to our portfolio of billion dollar brands, the McCrispy continues to be an important catalyst of chicken growth for many of our markets. The UK, for example, has achieved market share leadership in chicken, a remarkable growth over the past few years with the launch of both the McCrispy and the McSpicy Chicken sandwiches. We look forward to further scaling these new global favorites to customers around the world. A challenging macro environment including rising interest rates and elevated costs continues to create volatile consumer confidence levels and put pressure on consumer spending. Providing customers with an affordable option has always been core to McDonald's. But in these challenging times, it is even more important for us to remain agile, proactively meeting the needs of our customers. Germany continued the success of its McSmart menu. Initially introduced last quarter to provide entry level affordable meals, it's contributed to our best sales quarter ever in the market and lifted value perceptions with consumers. The UK unveiled a similar offering with its new Saver Meal deals in June, and the early results are encouraging. A permanent addition to the menu, it aims to provide consistent everyday affordability and ensure customers can still enjoy their favorite treats like the Double Cheeseburger despite the rising cost environment. Maintaining our leadership position in value is crucial to future success, and McDonald's holds the number one position in good value for money and affordability across most of our major markets. This shows that even in the most challenging of environments, our customers know that they can rely on McDonald's to provide an affordable destination for the food that they love. But we know that customers' perceptions on value are made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience that we provide. We've continued to enhance the customer experience, providing the seamless and memorable interactions our customers have come to expect. Last quarter, we introduced an enhanced ordering process through our app in the US with the goal of delivering a faster and more enjoyable experience for the customer. While we're still learning from this deployment, early results have been extremely positive with elevated sales initiated through the app, increased customer satisfaction and improved service times. Canada also introduced new experiences in the app with the launch of the Frequent Fryer program. Tapping into Canadians\u2019 passion for travel, the digital campaign celebrated McDonald's fries and the opportunity to taste them in other countries. This creative approach to reengage with our loyalty members resulted in lifts to both digital acquisition and digital customer frequency during the campaign. Now in over 50 markets across the globe, we're continuing to build stronger relationships with our loyalty customers and fueling growth of our digital sales in the process. In our top six markets, digital sales represent nearly 40% of system wide sales and our loyalty members remain highly engaged with over 52 million 90 day active members across our top six markets. As our relationships with these customers continue to grow, we will unlock additional customer needs and explore investments for continued digital innovation at a scale that only McDonald's can achieve. Strong execution across all elements of Accelerating the Arches is creating additional customer demand and share gains across most of our major markets. But we recognize that we're operating in a challenging macro environment where costs remain elevated, customer discretionary spending is limited and industry traffic is pressured. In line with industry trends and as inflation begins to normalize later in the year, we expect top line growth to moderate. Turning to the P&L. Our strong top line performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.17 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of 25% in constant currencies, excluding other charges and gains in both periods as well as a prior year tax settlement. Our company operated margin performance for the first half of 2023 is in line with our expectations and remains hampered by continued cost pressures. As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect macro headwinds will continue. Total restaurant margin dollars grew by nearly $450 million in constant currencies or nearly 14% for the quarter. Strong franchise sales performance continues to be offset by targeted and temporary franchisee assistance, provided mainly to our European franchisees where elevated costs continue to pressure restaurant cash flows. We're still anticipating that these efforts will have an impact of $100 million to $150 million for the year. G&A for the quarter decreased 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by prior year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April and timing of anticipated current year spend. We are pleased with our strong adjusted operating margin of just over 47% for the first half of the year. This was driven by the continued strong top line growth that I mentioned and timing within our G&A spend. For the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be about 46%, reflecting heavier G&A spend in the back half of the year, along with an expected property gain in other operating income in quarter four. And our adjusted effective tax rate was just over 18% for the quarter. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. As I've said before, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand. Our investments through Accelerating the Arches to create cultural conversations and develop industry leading innovations have increased the value of our brand and kept us relevant. In June, McDonald's earned an impressive 18 lions across 10 markets at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Additionally, our team in the UK and Ireland was awarded the prestigious Marketing Society's Grand Prix, which recognizes the best marketer in the country. The McDonald's brand also rose to the number five spot in the 2023 Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands report, behind only the leading tech industry brands. As we've upped our marketing game, it's also been interesting to see how our food quality scores with customers have continued to increase. The more customers love our brand, the more they love our food. Beyond the great brand stories created by our marketing teams and agency partners are the thousands of franchisees around the world who create real life brand stories every day in the restaurants with our customers. Our franchisees and crew bring the McDonald's brand to life with great hospitality, convenience and service. The best brand in the industry backed by the best franchisees has been our value creation formula for decades. We're always looking ahead to what is next and asking ourselves, how do we continue to create the world's greatest franchising opportunity for the world's greatest franchisees for generations to come. This requires making decisions for the long term to earn our success rather than expecting it or assuming it. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is focused on just that, setting up the company and our franchisees to continue to prosper. Laying the foundation for the future also involve strongly defending the franchise system and independent ownership rights, a position echoed by the National Franchise Leadership Alliance, the elected representative voice of McDonald's franchise organizations across the US. I'm confident that the system is focused on the right priorities and is well positioned to meet the customer needs of tomorrow. Thank you to the over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, our thousands of franchisees and our entire network of suppliers around the world who bring the McDonald's experience to life each day. I'll now turn it over to Mike for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: My question is about your expectations for the US consumer. I think last quarter, there was some discussion about your base case that the US would expect a mild recession. And I think you called out that you're starting to see some evidence of trade down in your check management at that time. So I'm wondering, has there been any change in your current thinking and whether those consumer behaviors have intensified or moderated in the last quarter.\nChris Kempczinski: I'd say, overall, there hasn't been dramatic change in the US consumer. Sentiment is actually improving a little bit but we're certainly still far off of where we were back in 2019. As we look at our spend by different sort of economic cohorts, we are gaining share in the -- if you look at incomes under $100,000, we're actually doing quite well there, which suggests that we're getting some benefit from trade down, from things like full service dining, casual dine, et cetera. And then even if you go to incomes of $45,000 and less, our business is performing well there. What we're seeing with that group is we are seeing a little bit of a decrease in order size, but it's being offset by a very strong or continued strength in traffic. So I think net-net, when you look at all of it, there is certainly concern with the US consumer that shows up in their sentiment. But our business and particularly I think our value positioning in the market has put us into a good position to be able to weather that and continue to drive the share gains that you're seeing.\nIan Borden: I just might add a little bit to Chris' comments. I think we've talked -- if I just focus on the US over the last couple of quarters about kind of these two broad areas of probably consumer adjustment that we've seen. I would say the first one is we are seeing some consumers that are kind of trading down from those more premium or higher priced items in the menu to more core and value. And then I think as Chris said, we have consumers that continue to visit but probably are just buying a little less. So their basket sizes are a little bit smaller than what they've been previously. I think the context is those two factors, though, have been really, while they've been in play for a number of quarters now, have been very consistent. So we're not seeing any further kind of deterioration, I think that, which is encouraging. And as Chris touched on, I think, speaks to our leading value for money and affordable positioning in the US business, which we know is industry leading and where we've maintained a really strong gap to the competitive set. I mean, I think it is -- I think the consumer still remains under pressure, obviously, with the macro context, with all of the inflationary impacts that they're seeing on their kind of their basket of goods and obviously with rising interest rates, But we know we had obviously positive traffic growth in the quarter in the US business. We know that on a comp basis, we continue to outperform the broader sector. And I think as Chris touched on in his opening remarks, we continue to focus on the experience and we know based on the feedback that we're seeing from our customers that we're delivering an improved experience. I think that's a credit to the US business and all of our franchisees and the really strong focus they've got on executing and make sure we deliver for the customer when they do choose us.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Ian, I wanted to follow up on your comments about sales moderating as the year goes on, which is understandable given the starting point here. But specifically, I was hoping you could perhaps break down the guest count growth versus the check growth in the US, and if you have it in IOM as well for the second quarter. And then how do you expect the check growth component to moderate as kind of the inflation environment gets a little bit more moderate? So I guess if you could just frame that up for us that would be helpful.\nIan Borden: Well, look, what I'll do is, I think, kind of give you the broad brush factors that I think we consider when we talk to kind of our expectation of a moderation in our top line as we kind of work through the back half of the year. I think there are three things there that I'd call out. The first is just we certainly believe from a kind of COVID comparability that the substantive kind of tailwinds are fully behind us as we move into the back half of the year. So I think that's the first piece. The second piece is just as we've talked to in our opening remarks, I mean, we certainly are seeing inflation start to gradually come down. I think that's been the case in the US business probably starting the end of last year. It's obviously still elevated, but I think we are seeing that gradual kind of decline. And I think in the majority of our international markets, we started to see, I think, as we head into the back half of the year, the gradual decline begin there as well. And so I think as inflation begins to come down, I would certainly expect our pricing levels to also start to come down. So that's the second factor. And I think then the third factor would just be, as Chris touched on previously, I mean, I think there are a number of our top markets where we know the macroeconomic conditions are challenging. We know there continues to be a lot of pressure on consumers. We know consumer sentiment continues to be impacted. And so we do expect the broader sector to kind of begin to kind of decline in those markets as we go through the back half of the year. And so I think that's kind of the third broad kind of trend that we think about when we talk about moderation. So if I spoke specifically to the US, I think we're obviously looking at kind of a one year comparable but also kind of comparing back to 2019, I think that moderation is probably more pronounced in the back half of the second half than the front half. But I think if you step back and you think -- you look at the quarter two results, we had positive traffic across each of the three operating segments. We are laser focused on what we certainly feel is the most important metric, which is that we are continuing to gain market share in the majority of our top markets. We know we continue to outperform the competitive set and that's certainly what we're laser focused on. We feel really confident about how our Accelerating the Arches strategy continues to resonate across all the markets we do business with and the strength of our underlying momentum.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Just looking at the guidance that you provided. I think you mentioned that operating margins, you're now expecting at 46% for this full year ex the restructuring charges seemingly raised from the 45% prior. Just wondering if you can maybe offer some color as to what you believe are the primary drivers of that? And just as importantly, how should we think about that operating margin looking out one, two, three years? Is that reasonable to assume that, that continues to grind higher or is there a certain level where you'd expect that would top out whether just naturally or whether based on reinvestment that you might want to make? I'm just wondering how you think about that operating margin, especially in the current environment.\nIan Borden: Well, let me start with that one. So let me start, I think, with 2023. And as you touched on, I think we started the year with an op margin guidance of about 45%. We've updated that now to say about 46%. We're really pleased with our performance in the first half of the year where we were about 47% from an op margin standpoint. And I think that connects to what we've talked about pretty consistently, which is we do believe that over time, as we continue to drive top line growth that we can continue to get leverage in our op margin line. I think we saw that in the first half. As we head into the second half, I think there are a couple of things that kind of are specific to the guidance for the full year. Firstly, I think it's the inflationary pressures and margin pressures, we certainly believe will continue. I just talked about kind of the moderation of the top line as we kind of work through the rest of the year. Also expect, as I touched on in my opening remarks that our G&A spend for the year will be more back half than front half weighted. So that's a factor. And the other call out and I kind of touched on this again in my opening remarks was we do expect, and this is in the guidance, that we will have a onetime property gain in the fourth quarter. I think as we look forward, again, I would just reiterate that we certainly believe as we're continuing to being able to drive that top line growth that we can continue to gain leverage in the op margin line. And I think it's something we'll certainly talk about further in the Analyst Day at the end of the year.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: I would love to hear more detail about the IOM trends and insights from those countries. Where are you seeing relative strength and weakness and what do you ascribe those trends to? I mean, I asked partly because we're still dealing with post-COVID dynamics in some of those markets that are perhaps greater than the US with some back to travel, back to work in center cities. But I'd also be interested to hear about macro headwinds you're already seeing in the business. You mentioned the value menu launches in Germany and UK. So wondering if you were doing those as proactive launches or perhaps reactionary?\nChris Kempczinski: Well, as you saw in the results, overall, our IOM business put up very strong performance. So we're very pleased with that and it's a credit to the team and how they're executing against that. Also, as you probably know, our IOM, particularly our European markets are facing even more significant inflationary pressures, UK in particular than in the US. And the teams there have done a really nice job of putting in the pricing that they need to, to ensure that we're protecting margins -- franchisee margins, but at the same time that we are maintaining our affordability and value for money leadership in those markets. And our measures there continue to hold up quite well. I think the other thing that's going well for us is just the execution that we're seeing in our IOM markets. They continue to make progress on service times. Customer satisfaction scores are continuing to increase. So there's been really strong performance from an operations standpoint over in Europe. Where you do see -- and every country has obviously got a little bit of a different nuance. But certainly, the unrest that I mentioned in my opening comments in France has put some challenge from a macro standpoint on that business. We've also had a number of restaurants that have actually been impacted through some of the protests there that we've had to take offline, and they're going to need to go and get rebuilt. So there is pressure that we've seen from a macro standpoint in France. In the UK, UK is dealing with probably the worse -- we're close to the worst consumer sentiment in Europe, and that's putting some pressure on the business. But overall, our UK business is performing well. And I think each market has its own approach to value. But we're seeing, I think, that probably being a little bit more of an orientation in those markets just to make sure that as we build our second half plan that we've got a strong value message as part of that. So overall, very pleased with how our IOM and, in particular, our European markets are performing. And I wouldn't say there's anything one in particular that -- the reason for that is it's the whole playbook of value. It's a focus on core menu, they've had great chicken growth and then, of course, we're seeing all the benefits for digital. And one of the things that is maybe not fully appreciated, but with 52 million people in our top six markets now in our loyalty program, we do typically see about a 15% increase in frequency when we get members into loyalty. And we're still seeing high single digit growth rates in our loyalty programs in terms of sign ups. So that continues to be a tailwind for us in the business.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Actually, my question is in the context of value. It's a perfect follow-up to that. So you discussed some of the success of the McSmart value menu, the Saver menu, and obviously, I'm hearing a lot about global solutions. As we kind of think about ways to drive traffic, drive sales, maybe to some extent, at the expense of margins. Does it make sense to consider the return of dollar style menu in the US, Canada, France, Australia, what have you? I mean, is a value menu, at least in some construct, part of what you see the big six or big seven offerings to consumers to be, is that something that is on the front burner?\nChris Kempczinski: So I think the starting point is to just emphasize, we're winning on value. So the programs that we have in place are working and delivering for us, And it shows up not just in our overall performance, the fact that we're driving both check and we're driving guest counts, but it shows in our consumer sentiment scores where we are maintaining our leadership in affordability and in value for money. So there's nothing broken from a value standpoint that from my vantage point you would need to change. I think we feel really good that the value programs that we have in place are actually driving the success. The probably only thing that teams would be looking at is as they think about marketing communication in the back half of the year, do they maybe emphasize a little bit more of driving awareness of the value programs that already exist in the market, that may be something that some markets consider doing. But we feel great about the value programs that we have in place in each of our markets today and I wouldn't expect to see any changes from the programs that we have.\nIan Borden: Maybe just a little -- a build to Chris. I think just one of the things that we feel really good about in the business is just how our teams are continuing to be proactive and agile in kind of, obviously, a volatile set of external circumstances. And I think that's -- the example in both the UK and Germany of what the teams have introduced there is a great example of learning from each other because there's a lot of consistency in those programs, but bringing them to life in ways that are relevant and doing that, while we're in a position of strength as we are in both markets, Germany, as an example, in the second quarter had an all time sales record for their business. So I think this is us staying close to our consumers, making sure we're leaning into the needs of our consumers as they work through the broader macroeconomic challenges and I think really continuing to make sure that such an important strategic element of our business continues to resonate in consumers in a way that's relevant in the context of each individual market.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: I wanted to ask about store level margins. Clearly, your same store sales were very impressive in the second quarter, over 10% comps in the United States. But store level margins in the US were still down about 70 bps year-over-year in the quarter. So can you talk more specifically about what is causing the drag on margins despite such strong top line? And as the top line potentially slows moving forward, as you talked about, is there a scenario where store level margins can start to show improvements or is this a situation where you anticipate store level margins to feel more pressure for longer?\nIan Borden: Well, look, I would start with the headline. I mean, our belief is that the best way to drive sustainable margin improvement is for us to focus on driving strong momentum in the business. And I think the US business is the perfect example of that. While certainly as you work through these kind of rapid and accelerated periods of inflation, there's pressure from a percentage basis and we've clearly seen that in the US business. I mean, I think, that the example would be that the strength of our momentum in the US actually means that our owner operator cash flow is up year-over-year obviously in a continued challenging environment. And that's what we're focused on is how do we drive sustainable margin dollar cash flow growth for ourselves and for our franchisees. I think from a percentage basis, you're right. I mean, I think we continue to see pressure, obviously, from food and paper inflation, labor inflation. I think our -- where we talked about earlier in the year remains in place. We said this and I think we are consistent with that in the sense that we thought our McOpCo margin in the US business would be kind of roughly in line in terms of '23 with where we were at quarter four 2022. But we have a lot of confidence that as we continue to drive that strong top line momentum as we go forward that will continue to be able to drive both margin dollars and over time, margin percentage growth within the business.\nChris Kempczinski: And I would just add, as I mentioned in my opening comments, I've been to a number of markets. I've had a chance to talk to franchisees in a number of markets. And I've been very impressed and pleased with how they're thinking about working through the current scenario right now, which is they're playing the long game. And they recognize the importance of us continuing to make sure we have leadership in value and affordability as they also think about how do they rebuild margins back to kind of where we were during this pre-inflationary spike. And so in many cases, the conversations we're having with franchisees are about more of exiting the year and where do we want to see margins when we exit the year but recognize that there maybe some short-term impacts on this as we continue to balance our need for margin but also our need to maintain our leadership with customers. So hats off to the franchisees who I think are taking the exact right perspective on this and it's what shows up in our performance and the reason why we're taking share in almost all of our major markets.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: I wanted to just ask a little bit more on how you're thinking about maintaining some of the underlying momentum and the share gains you've seen for quite some time now in the US. As you think about some of the key drivers in place across the three Ds, the operational execution, newer sort of ready on arrival stuff, et cetera. Can you just sort of unpack how you think about the most impactful traffic and sales opportunities in the next year, maybe even over the coming years?\nChris Kempczinski: It all goes back to the strategy of Accelerating the Arches. And when we laid out Accelerating the Arches, we talked about our MCD framework, it's about great marketing, it's about focusing on core menu, it's about three Ds, now the four Ds. And so one of the things that I -- and that underlying all of that is about great execution. And I think one of the things that, for me, gives me confidence about the strength and resiliency of our business, not just in the US but around the world, is that it's broad based. It's not being driven by one-off promotion. It's not being driven by kind of just silver bullets. You're seeing it because of consistent execution across the entire strategy. So you're seeing evidence of where we continue, I think, to up our game from a marketing standpoint, that's driving strength around our brand scores. Our brand has never been in a better place than it's been. Our focus on core menu and things like best burger, the focus that we have on chicken, we're gaining share in both chicken and beef which -- off of core menu, which has a lot of benefits. And then we continue to do a great job of executing against our three Ds and will against our four Ds. Digital for us is something that is actually, I think, a virtuous loop, where you're seeing the stronger our digital business becomes, the more that it's driving customer engagement in digital. Our app downloads, and when you compare us to anybody else in the industry, it's orders of magnitude difference and that creates some economies of scale that become self perpetuating over time. So as I look out for the business, for us, it's going to be about continuing to do all the things that we're doing on that. And underneath that is the execution that we're seeing in our restaurants. And with the PACE program that we put in place last year, it was in most of our major markets. This year, we added the US. But you're seeing service times come down across the board in our major markets. You're seeing CSAT or customer satisfaction scores go up in all of our restaurants. So I wouldn't attribute our success to any one thing. It's the fact that we're executing across the entire Accelerating the Arches playbook that gives me confidence. And this is a momentum business. When you've got momentum, it helps and it can be self perpetuating. Now you don't want to get complacent on that. But the fact that we have momentum, I think, is driving an ambition. It continues to drive our operators' willingness to invest because they do see that as we play this out, we've got a long runway, and we certainly believe we have a long runway here at McDonald's.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril at RBC.\nChris Carril: So Chris, I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks and you plan to share more at the Investor Day, but could you maybe expand a bit more on the development outlook as we think about the second half of this year as well as beyond 2023? You've seen strong top line momentum, improving margins and you've made organizational changes to help support development. So what are the key unlocks here or next steps going forward to accelerate new restaurant openings?\nChris Kempczinski: Well, we will share much more detail about this at the Analyst Day at the end of the year. So I won't get into the specifics. But I will talk about the activities that we're doing right now, which is one of the starting point is just looking at our opportunity with traditional restaurants. And if you think about -- over the last several years, our focus has been largely globally around reinvestment. In the US, we haven't grown units going all the way back to 2014. If you go to a number of our large IOM markets, the growth there from a unit standpoint has been pretty anemic compared to what we think is the opportunity. And so we are doing a very detailed, both top down and bottoms up look, to say what is the development opportunity that exists in each of those markets and how do we go and exploit that. I\u2019d use the US as one example. I think the other thing that we look at is, think about the US restaurant estate today. And the US restaurant estate today reflects probably what the demographic profile or the population profile looked like 20 or 30 years ago. And imagine the amount of shifts that happened, people moving to the South to the Southeast, that isn't reflected in our footprint. Our footprint reflects what the population looked like probably 20 or 30 years ago. So you end up finding there's a number of places around the US where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today, that opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after. The other thing that we're overlaying on top of this is we are, as I mentioned in my opening comments, thinking about small format and how do we bring new concepts that open up real estate opportunities that under a traditional model would not necessarily be available to us. A big reason that we can now look at those is because of the growth that's happened with the digital and delivery where you don't necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants. So you're now able to look at real estate sites that previously would have been sort of off limits to us those become opportunities. So we're taking all of those things together and rolling that up to get a perspective of what we think the new unit potential is going to be over the next four or five years. As you would imagine, it's a longer lead item. So this isn't going to be something that shows up in 2024 and even in 2025. But you can start to focus on it, get some real benefits in '26 and beyond, and that's what we'll share at Analyst Day.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: I wanted to ask about the reiterated $100 million to $150 million of targeted and temporary rent relief in Europe. And recognizing the numerous macro challenges in the market, the other brand is certainly successfully navigating these with impressive top line strength in front half of 2023. So when you combine this with better than expected IOM and McOpCo margins in 2Q, just in that cost pressure perhaps may not have been a severe surge than anticipated. What do you need to see to reduce the outlook for relief? And just a quick follow up to that, can you help level set how much of that $100 million to $150 million has been since then so far in 2023?\nIan Borden: So let me just kind of touch on a few things. Look, I think as we've talked about before, providing support to our franchisees is kind of normal course of business for us. Obviously, the difference this year is just the kind of the pace, the scale and the breadth of the pressures, and as you highlighted, obviously probably most centered in Europe. So I think on the backdrop of all of that, we decided towards the back end of last year to kind of provide some more extensive support, as we talk about always, it's always targeted and temporary. It's always fact based support, that support goes to franchisees that need support. And I think as you've heard me talk a little bit on some of the other questions this morning, that inflation is kind of coming to play the way we predicted it. So I don't think there's been a difference versus our expectations, which is why we've reiterated that we continue to expect that we will spend between the $100 million to $150 million for the year this year. I think the other thing I just want to go back to because it's so important and it's certainly something I strongly believe in. I've given you the example before of as we work through COVID and we provided support at particular moments as we work through that with our franchisees, I think that was fundamental to the exit velocity and momentum that our business had. I think what you can see now if you look at our IOM segment, and Chris talked about this earlier, is the strength of our underlying momentum, the consistency of our momentum. And I believe that's fundamentally connected to decisions like this because they keep our system fully aligned, they keep our system front footed and focused on the opportunities that we have to continue to drive growth in our business. I believe that's a significant strategic advantage that we have. And I think it's been a key contributor to why we continue to outperform even in markets that maybe more difficult from a macroeconomic context.\nChris Kempczinski: And I would just add, again, back to my market visits that I've done in the last couple of months. In some of those conversations that I've had with franchisees, I typically do dinners every time I visit the market with a group of franchisees. And many of them in our IOM markets specifically have thanked us for the support that we're giving and attributed their willingness and ability to focus on the long term to not necessarily just be chasing pricing in the short term because they understand we're in this together, we're both making investments to ensure that the success of our business is long term focused. So I think Ian hit it exactly right. When we make the decisions and do the right things for the long term, the benefits time and again we're proven right on that. And I feel very good about the program that we've got in place. And it is temporary and targeted as it appropriately should be.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Sara Senatore with BofA.\nSara Senatore: I guess a couple of questions around the margins, please. First, on the G&A. Could you just talk a bit about what the back half spending might be on? You sort of come in pretty decently below the full year guide. So I'm just trying to understand what the step-up might be and how to think about that G&A as a percentage of system sales maybe even going forward. And then could you just give us some color on pricing and commodity basket inflation for the US and the IOM markets. I'm sorry if I missed it. But just how much price is on the menu and what the baskets look like?\nIan Borden: Well, let me start with G&A. just I mean, I think a bit of a headline there. I mean I think our normal, let's call it, cycle of spend in the business is probably always a little bit more back half than front half weighted. I think this year, that's a little bit more pronounced. I think there are kind of a couple of probably more substantive factors for that. I think the first one is around our continued investment in technology and digital. I mean, I think you've heard us talk, and me in particular previously, that we will -- we have the capacity and the capability. And we will continue to invest in areas in the business where we believe there's a significant opportunity to drive growth and generate a return. And I think our digital and technology investments have been a clear strong example and continue to be one of our key growth drivers. And I think as Chris touched on previously, we continue to believe we've got significant opportunity as we go forward to unlock further capabilities around our digital and technology platforms. And so we're continuing to accelerate investment in those areas. I think the second one is back to our global business services organization. As you know, as part of our ATO changes earlier this year, we stood up a global business service organization at an enterprise level because we felt there was a relatively significant opportunity to look at how we can digitize, I'll call it, the operational part of our business and drive sustainable efficiencies as we go forward. So we're doing a fair bit of work and investing right now and looking at that opportunity to understand how big is it, what's it going to take to get after it, how should we think about sequencing and prioritizing the investments. Obviously, once you go into those sorts of journeys, there are multiyear journeys and commitments to kind of deliver that sustainable end benefit. But if we think of the kind of the broader environment today, the ability to kind of drive sustainable efficiency, the ability to get data and analytics in a sustainable way, I think, is becoming more important. And we think there's a significant opportunity there that we're looking at. So I think our guidance remains intact as we stated at the beginning of the year, which is we expect our G&A to be in that 2.2% to 2.3% of sales range. I would say I think I certainly expect that we'll be closer to the higher end versus the lower end of that range, but that's a bit of texture on G&A. I think on pricing, I mean, obviously, pricing varies significantly based on the context in the individual markets. So maybe what I can do is just give you a little -- I mean, obviously, pricing remains elevated as inflation more broadly remains elevated in the majority of our markets, maybe a little texture on the US, which is, I think if you look at the second quarter, we were kind of on average at a low double digit level of pricing in the business. I think as we work through the rest of the year, we'll probably end the year in that kind of low double digit range. A lot of the pricing in the second quarter is kind of carryover from 2022 in the US business as we work through that kind of peak inflationary period. And obviously, as I talked about earlier, we're kind of getting those two offsets to the pricing we're taking, which is kind of the trade down and consumers that are kind of continuing to visit but buying a little bit less, again, those two offsets have been very consistent. And as Chris and I have both talked to, we continue to see traffic growth in our US business. We continue to see market share gains, and we continue to see this kind of strong leading value for money and affordability positioning. So I think what I've talked about before, which I think is really important is the work we've done in the couple of years before we've kind of got into this more challenging macroeconomic environment around our capabilities that we've put in place with our third party advisers that we work with and who make recommendations to our business, including our franchisees on how we price, obviously, our franchisees make those decisions. I think we've had a significant improvement in our capability. I think as Chris has talked about, we've had pretty good discipline from our system and the pricing that we've taken to really kind of get the balance of working through the short term challenge with a long term focus on continuing to make sure we're driving momentum. And we feel pretty good about how we've been able to navigate, obviously, a complex environment.\nMike Cieplak: We're at the bottom of the hour. That completes our call. Thank you, Chris.

And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks Mike and good morning, everyone. You know ordinarily in a global business like ours, for a quarterly earnings call, you're prepping to memorize all the different sets of numbers. What's notable about this earnings call is McDonald's consistency, consistency in the strength of our numbers, consistency in the powerful drivers of our business, and consistency in the excitement that exists across the system about the opportunities that lie in front of us. Let's start with the numbers. At the top line, you only need to know one number, 12.6%. US comparable sales, 12.6%, IOM comparable sales, 12.6%, IDL comparable sales, 12.6%, and global comparable sales, you guessed it, 12.6%. These results reflects strong consumer demand for McDonald's that we are seeing around the world despite a challenging operating environment and historically low consumer sentiment in many markets. It is clear that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working and we are operating from a position of strength. Each of our MCD growth pillars is contributing to our strong balanced performance and importantly, what we've talked in the past about the noise associated with the guest count metric, it is encouraging to see guest counts grow in every segment. In just the last few months, I have visited with our McDonald's teams in France, Japan, the Philippines, UAE and Israel. It's been inspiring to see the dedication of all three legs of the stool. Our teams are proud of what they've accomplished and are performing at a high level. For me, it's been energizing to hear their ideas for how we can do even more to take care of our customers. That's what I love most about the McDonald's system, our restless ambition. While we feel good about our current strategy, our success is driving us to do even more to lay a foundation for the future. Back in January, we announced the evolution of Accelerating the Arches. We're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while advancing two new initiatives. The first is accelerating restaurant development. Our strong performance has earned us the right to open new restaurants at a faster rate than we have historically. We're focused this year on determining the best path forward to meet customer demand and look forward to sharing more at our Investor Day later this year. The second newer element of our strategy is fundamentally rethinking how we as a company can work better together to become faster, more innovative, and more efficient. We're calling this Accelerating the Organization. In March, we convened our Annual Leadership Summit with top leaders from across the globe. Part of this meeting, we discussed three changes to our ways of working that will enable us to leverage our scale more effectively to meet the needs of our system and customers and unlock significant growth potential. The first is implementing horizontal ways of working. For years, our organization like many others was too siloed, whether that be geographically siloed or functionally siloed, and yet our biggest challenges and opportunities are rarely limited to just one market. They can't be solved by only one function. They require collaborating across the organization to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences to devise the best system solution that can be scaled globally. In other words, they need to be solved horizontally. With Accelerating the Organization, we're now structured to work much more seamlessly in a horizontal fashion to solve these problems once and then scale solutions across markets, for example, is our app offering a seamless and personalized user experience. We're continuing to increase our speed of service. Those are opportunities across every single market and require the expertise of multiple functions. To support our ambition, to scale innovations with greater agility and collaborate more effectively, our second key shift is adopting One McDonalds Way to standardize the common processes we use to drive consistency and enable speed. We're an innovative entrepreneurial organization, but once a part of our system somewhere has solved a problem or developed a novel idea, we need to stop the work elsewhere. We don't need every market to invent its own light bulbs, so to speak. This approach allows us to use our size and scale for the greatest impact. For example, we're already seeing success in how our marketing teams are implementing common processes to quickly scale great creative such as the Raise Your Arches' campaign, which Ian will talk more about. Finally, we're making strategic investments in digitizing our organization and implementing new tools and platforms that make it easier for employees to access information to gain insights and drive performance. Ultimately, this will allow our market teams to spend more time in the restaurants, understanding the needs of customers, franchisees, and crew. Key to operationalizing all three areas of our internal transformation is our Enterprise Global Business Services Organization, also known as GBS. In 2023, GBS will focus on building a long-term strategy that ultimately provides a better experience for all three legs of the stool. GBS will be a key enabler to digitizing our organization, driving efficiency and providing value back to the business for our people, our franchisees, and our suppliers. Harnessing the power of our scale, our ability to strategically invest and the versatility of our system is the secret sauce that will empower us to provide even more memorable customer experiences for generations to come. To expand further on how we are optimizing the business and our growth strategy. I will now turn it over to Ian.\nIan Borden: Thanks Chris. The first quarter of 2023 was yet another demonstration of McDonald's at its best. We entered the year with global momentum and remained laser focused on executing against our strategic growth pillars. Though challenging macro dynamics are still evident across many parts of the world, each of our segments and our global comp sales grew nearly 13% for the quarter. This demonstrates that no matter the operating environment, our customers continue to rely on McDonald's as an affordable destination for the delicious food they love delivered with the great service that they expect. Throughout the quarter, we showcased our iconic core menu equities while further scaling emerging equities across markets. I'll share a couple of examples of this in our chicken portfolio where we continue to expand and grow market share and an area where there is strong opportunity for growth. The U.S. leveraged learnings from the U.K., Canada, and Germany by relaunching its Crispy Chicken Sandwich under the McCrispy global equity umbrella. While there was no change to the core product, compelling creative, along with a new flavor offering supported demand, and help drive double-digit sales growth in the market, in fact, we now offer the McCrispy in 10 of our largest markets around the world, adding to our portfolio of billion dollar brands. Another example was in China where in March we featured the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich through a creative campaign that included a partnership with a popular streetwear brand tapping into local cultural relevance. The campaign generated significant social buzz, an increased brand relevancy with a younger generation. It's worth noting that China and Hong Kong originally introduced customers to McSpicy nearly 20 years ago, and it's now part of our core menu in 17 markets reflecting consumers growing preference for spicy across the globe. And while I'm on the topic of China, I want to point out that we saw steady recovery in the market with China posting positive comp sales growth for the quarter. Chicken was also critical to Canada's strong results. With the successful execution of the Chicken Big Mac promotion, a popular limited time offering that had significant success in the U.K. last year. By creating these fresh takes on our classic menu items, we've continued to build affinity and have consistently gained share across our top markets in the growing chicken category over the last few years. In parallel, we continue to maintain our market share leadership in beef, making our core menu offerings even better through enhanced cooking procedures and other slight changes such as improved buns. Now in over 50 markets around the globe, these improvements are resulting in hotter, juicier and tastier burgers. We're seeing improved taste perception scores across markets, giving customers yet another reason to eat at McDonald's. We recently began to introduce these changes to our U.S. customers through a rolling deployment, and the initial reaction has been positive. The Big Mac was also prominently featured across many markets this quarter with strong activations in both Canada and France. While each campaign came to life in its own way, the resulting lift in beef sales across both markets shows that this iconic menu item which became popular more than 50 years ago still resonates with consumers today. As I've mentioned before, rising costs continue to pressure consumer spending across markets. Our ability to meet customer needs in challenging times makes McDonald's value proposition even more important to highlight. In Germany, for example, the launch of the new McSmart Menu refreshed our everyday value bundles, providing smaller, more affordable meals to our consumers, and contributing to Germany's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp sales growth. Our marketing excellence was also on full display during the quarter, demonstrating our position as an affordable destination with iconic equities and strong execution. The Raise Your Arches campaign in the U.K. was a prime example of our marketing excellence in action, bringing to life the true power of the McDonald's brand in a new and unique way. This campaign did not feature our food or our restaurants. Yet by illustrating a simple gesture, the raising of eyebrows, our customers instantly recognize the semblance of the Golden Arches, and the engagement was remarkable. In fact, within the first weekend alone, Raise Your Arches reached millions of people and our customers reacted on social media more than 30,000 times. As the campaign quickly scaled to more than 30 markets across the globe, Raise Your Arches drove brand affinity around the world and once again proved the true power of the McDonald's brand. This is an example of how one singular idea can drive impact when shared across our markets. This is the One McDonalds Way that Chris mentioned earlier. MyMcDonald's Rewards is yet another example of how we've tapped into our marketing engine to deploy our loyalty platform throughout the system. Now in 50 markets, loyalty is building even stronger relationships with our customers, and the results continue to shine. In our top six markets, digital sales now represent almost 40% of system-wide sales, or nearly $7.5 billion growth of more than 30% over the last year. We have nearly 50 million, 90 day active members across these top markets, and our relationship with them continues to grow. We're learning when they visit, how they visit and what they buy. With more and more of our sales coming through identified channels than ever before, we're also continuing to improve our customers' mobile app experience with new initiatives that provide a more seamless interaction. The U.S. market, for example is piloting a new way of ordering through our app. Using existing location data, it allows our crew to start assembling a customer's order prior to their arrival at the restaurant, ultimately delivering hot, fresh food when customers arrive to pick up their order. While it's still early days deploying this new digital enhancement, initial results are already pointing to improve service times and elevated customer satisfaction scores. Australia and Canada enhanced the digital customer experience by officially integrating the ability to order and pay for McDelivery, all within the McDonald's app. This not only brings added choice and convenience for our customers but also allows them to earn loyalty points while they enjoy McDelivery at their doorstep and ensures that we maintain that direct connection. Across our digital and marketing initiatives, McDonald's continues to put the customer at the center of our strategy, driving top line growth and further strengthening the brand. Turning to the P&L. Strong sales performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.63 for the quarter, an increase over the prior-year of nearly 20% in constant currencies. This excludes restructuring charges of about $180 million primarily consisting of employee termination benefits and lease termination costs as we look to become faster, more innovative and more efficient as part of Accelerating the Organization. Our company-operated margins remained hampered this quarter by continued pressure from elevated commodities and wages. As we look to the remainder of the year, consistent with the expectations we communicated in January, we expect macro headwinds will continue with the potential for a recessionary environment across both the U.S. and Europe. Total restaurant margin dollars grew by over $375 million in constant currencies or more than 10% for the quarter driven by higher franchise margin dollars. One of the benefits of our franchise business model is the predictability and stability of our franchise margins particularly in a strong comp sales environment. As expected, strong franchise sales performance across our markets was offset by increased franchisee assistance as elevated cost inflation continued to put significant pressure on restaurant cash flows, particularly for our European franchisees. As I've mentioned before, we're providing targeted and temporary support, investing proactively to maintain focus on driving long-term growth during this challenging time. We still anticipate these efforts will have an impact of between $100 million to $150 million for the year. G&A for the quarter decreased slightly primarily driven by prior-year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April, and our adjusted effective tax rate was nearly 21% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 46% for the first quarter, a reflection of the strong top line growth. As we've said before, we expect to gain leverage on operating margin over time. And while this will not necessarily be linear based on a strong start to the year, we're pleased with our operating efficiency in quarter 1. Based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to reduce both the second quarter and full-year earnings per share by about $0.03 to $0.05. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year. Despite the economic uncertainty that may persist, we are well positioned with the unique strength and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide. As Chris talked about upfront, we are focused on how we can even further leverage this advantage in the future. With our strong underlying momentum and aligned focus on the right strategies moving forward, I remain confident that we will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. Our brand has never been more relevant than it is today, a testament to our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the over 2 million people in our system who bring it to life with our franchisees in the restaurants every single day. As part of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, we've been particularly focused on revving up our world-class marketing engine with our agency partners and internal teams. We have expectations of what creative excellence should look like, and we're certainly proud of the progress we've made. Others are echoing this sentiment, and the industry is taking notice. Recently, McDonald's topped The WARC Effective 100 for the fourth year running, a ranking of the world's most awarded campaigns and companies for effectiveness. This is in addition to earning the #2 spot on Fast Company's World's Most Innovative Companies List of 2023. While we are pleased with where our brand is today, we know there is still more opportunity ahead, particularly as we change our ways of working through Accelerating the Organization, which I discussed at the outset. As I've said before, as goes our brands, so goes the economic health of the company and our nearly 5,000 franchisees globally. As Ray Kroc once famously said, we're not in the hamburger business, we're in show business. This showcases the importance of marketing our brand, which is more than just the food that we serve. The McDonald's franchise business model has provided a significant on-ramp for so many to work hard and prosper. And we want to ensure that the opportunity exists for generations to come. In fact, our franchisees are generating significant returns over the life of their 20-year agreements, far exceeding their cost of capital and relevant benchmarks. At its core, Accelerating the Arches is about us continuing to set up the company and our franchisees to prosper in the long-term. To that end, we'll continue to marshal the weight of the company's resources so that the business model endures. Ray Kroc would often say that we cannot grow without trying new things or without taking risks. Together as a system, we have an extraordinary opportunity to lay the foundation for our future to maintain an unwavering bond with customers. We'll achieve this through continuous innovation, building digital relationships and delivering personalized experiences with ease, no matter how our customers choose to enjoy McDonald's. As I told our internal teams earlier this month, as we adapt to our new organization and new ways of working, the most important thing we can do is to keep taking care of our customers, our system and each other. As we face a dynamic operating environment and changing customer demand, I'm confident that Accelerating the Arches is the right playbook, combined with the actions we're taking to accelerate the organization to keep McDonald's best positioned to be there for our customers and navigate the next chapter of our growth. I want to acknowledge that the path to continuously improving how we innovate for customers in the system involves difficult decisions, and saying goodbye to valued colleagues is never easy. What gives me confidence in our path forward is how the people in our system time and again have shown up for each other to realize the full potential of the opportunity ahead. Thanks again to our incredible employees, franchisees and suppliers for your continued dedication and commitment. With that, I'll now turn to Mike for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions].\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you very much. Chris, with the robust momentum that the brand continues to see in the U.S., can you talk a bit more about your latest thoughts on the biggest opportunities that you see to continue to drive this guest count strength? I mean, you seem to be clearly executing against core points of focus. You highlighted some newer initiatives in detail today. So just curious if you kind of help loosely rank some of these opportunities for the U.S. business. Thank you.\nChrisKempczinski: Thanks, Dennis. One of the things that I feel very good about is the fact that what's driving the business is a balance of our three drivers here, marketing excellence, focusing on the core menu and our 3D. So we're getting good growth from each of those contributing to the success that you're seeing, not just in the U.S., but you're seeing globally. I think the other thing that I'm really pleased with is how we're seeing customer satisfaction scores improve around the world. PACE is one of the ways that we do this. That's our grading and consulting program that we launched in all of our major markets in 2022 with the exception of the U.S., which just launched. But we're typically seeing results that our customer satisfaction going up mid- to high single-digits. And we know that as you improve speed, accuracy, friendliness, quality, all of those metrics are correlated with business performance. And so for us, the fact that we are running better restaurants, our staffing situation is improving in restaurants around the world, combined with our MCD growth pillars, I think all of those things coming together is what's driving the success that you're seeing.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Good morning. Thank you. You talked about how you anticipate a recessionary macro environment to unfold in the U.S. and Europe. And how do you anticipate such a scenario to impact your operating results? Because back in the Great Recession, your same-store sales remained very strong and in some instances, even outpaced analyst expectations. You did have the dollar menu back then, but the model has truly been battle tested. So if you could talk about what your strategy this time around is, and do you see the business as differently positioned now versus 15 years ago?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks for the question. Going back to Q3 I think of last year is when we started getting asked questions about our outlook for the macro environment in 2023. And I would say our view remains unchanged, which is our base expectation is for a mild recession in the U.S. In Europe, we expected it to be more challenging. I think things are looking better in Europe than they were certainly back in Q3, but still compared to the U.S., I think more challenging in Europe. So our base expectation from a macro standpoint for 2023 is unchanged. I think how we're positioned, it goes back to the word I used in my opening, which is consistency. And our job is to make sure that no matter what the environment, whether you're in a boom cycle or whether you're in a more challenging macro environment like I think we are in right now, our business has to continue to perform. And one of the things that I feel really good about is, as you mentioned, in good times or in bad times, McDonald's tend to do well. I would just add a little color, which is we do see some of the pressures that give us reason to believe that our view on the macro outlook is accurate, which is, one, we are seeing a slight decrease in units per transaction. So things like did someone add fries to their order, how many items are they buying per order, we're seeing that go down in most of our markets around the world slightly, but it's still going down. And then the other thing is we continue to monitor very closely the acceptance of our pricing. I'm really proud of how our system has executed pricing in light of the double-digit inflation that we have been experiencing. But we are seeing, in some places, resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset. So I think all of those things are reflective of, again, a more challenging macro environment. But again, McDonald's, we perform well in good times and in bad. And so that's what gives us the optimism as we go through the rest of this year.\nIan Borden: Let me maybe just add a couple of things to what Chris talked about. I just think value for money and affordability, I would say, are two things that we're always laser-focused on, but I think, obviously, even more so in the current context. And I think if you look across our top markets, we have a leadership position in both of those attributes. We know that even as Chris talked to, we're having to take more price on the back of higher levels of inflation that the competitive gaps that we're maintaining versus the competitive set have remained consistent. So I think we're doing that in a very prudent and balanced way to make sure that we are kind of leaning into the needs of our consumers in the different markets around the world. I think the other thing, Brian, that you highlighted, which I think is important to call out is the business, if you look at the U.S. as an example, is in a much different position than the last time we went through an environment like this because of the strategic investments we've made over the last several years. I think about the fact that our entire estate is modernized now. I think as the fact that the channels that we've put in place through digital, where we can kind of interact with consumers on a more personal level, and so I think we've built a level of, I'll call it, pricing elasticity in just because of how we've continued to invest in the brand and the experience for our customers that puts us in a strategic advantage, I think, versus much of the competitive set around us. And so again, a period like this is never easy for anyone to work through, but I certainly think we're really well positioned to navigate the challenges ahead.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me. I had a quick clarification and a question. The first clarification, I just wanted to make sure I understood. You had such consistent performance across the segments and even quarter-over-quarter. What kind of -- did you have consistent pricing? Was the traffic sort of similar? I'm just trying to understand kind of the underlying dynamics because the top line versus similar despite very different operating environments. And then the question is, you talked about value for the money, but obviously, lots of margin pressure on the company-operated stores. Are there limits to what you can do here because of your franchisees? Do you anticipate maybe some of the pressures rolling off and so that makes it easier? Just trying to understand kind of the extent to which you can continue to offer such sharp value when margins are under pretty meaningful pressure. Thank you.\nIan Borden: Good morning, Sara. Thanks for the question. Look, I think -- and Chris touched on this upfront, but just I think the consistency of how our strategy is being brought to life across each of our three operating segments is really what's behind the performance. I mean, obviously the context, the pricing is different across different markets depending on level of inflation, et cetera. But I think if you go back to what Chris talked about upfront is we're seeing really good consistency from what I'll call the mix of check and traffic growth. I think we're seeing a lot of consistency around how we're positioned from a value for money and affordability standpoint. And if you look at the key parts of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, there's a lot of consistency and how those are being brought to life for our system. And we feel really good also, as Chris highlighted, just about the focus on execution, which is coming to life across every part of our business and how that's translating into a better experience. And we're seeing really good consistency in that, feedback from our customers and the improvement in the customer satisfaction scores that we're seeing. And so I think that's really what's behind. I think the consistency of results is when our system gets focused on the opportunity ahead of it and brings that to life with a lot of execution and discipline. I think that's what drives the consistency in our performance.\nChris Kempczinski: The only thing I would add is, certainly, one of the things that gives our system confidence is the top line performance because there's an understanding that what we're dealing with right now from an inflation standpoint that, that is going to improve. Certainly, our expectation is it's going to improve as the year unfolds. And so when you have this kind of strong top line momentum and you're working your way through inflation, ultimately, you start to see the benefits of that. And one of the things that we're seeing in the U.S., the U.S. has slipped back to being cash flow positive for our franchisees in quarter 1. 2022 was more challenging for them from a cash flow standpoint. But again, when you have a strong top line and you're working your way through inflation, you can be pretty confident, you can be very confident that you're going to get back to the cash flow growth that our system expects. And so we feel good about that sort of message is what keeps the system aligned for the long-term.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Good morning, thank you. Chris, you spent quite a bit of time talking about just some of the organizational changes and ways of working. How is that -- how will that be visible? Or how should we assess the success of that for those of us that are kind of looking at it externally? And then I guess just more specifically, as we think about SG&A expense, it seems like some of the costs that have come off with the employment changes will be reallocated to other things. Could you comment on just where that will be going as we think about 2023?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, from an overall how do you assess whether the work changes that we announced as part of Accelerating the Organization have an impact, it doesn't show up in the numbers. And it needs to show up in the top line, and it needs to flow through to the bottom line. So I wouldn't get too nuanced in any particular metric other than top line growth, how that flows through to EPS and ultimately, what that's also doing for the system economic health. But as I said in my comments, I do think that we have an opportunity to get faster, more innovative, more efficient. The only way that, that was going to happen is we needed to change some of our ways of working where there was just too much internal, what I just call it, obstacles that were impeding our ability to move with that sort of speed. So as we get all of this in place, I think it should give you confidence that we're going to be able to continue to drive the performance. And then what that ultimately means is there's going to be -- there needs to be an efficiency component to that, but it also allows for us to reinvest in the business. I don't think for 2023, everything that we've said around our G&A guidance, that's already embedded in. We'll talk about it at Analyst Day at the end of the year what our outlook is longer-term for G&A. But ultimately, the metric that you should hold us to is the one you always hold us to, which is, are we growing the top line? Are we growing EPS, and what's the health of our franchisee base?\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\nChristopher Carril: Hi, good morning. So in the context of maintaining your operating margin outlook of about 45% for the full-year because even with the strong start to the year, could you provide us with any additional detail on your latest thinking around the cost inflation outlook, maybe particularly food and packaging costs and then just the pacing of those inflationary pressures over the balance of the year as you see them today? Thanks.\nIan Borden: Yes, good morning, Chris. Let me take that one. Let me just start with the back half of your question then I'll kind of work back to what you asked upfront. I mean, I think if you look at -- I'll kind of center in on a data point, which is kind of our quarter one company-operated margin percent, which actually, if you look at it on a percentage basis, we were slightly below where we were expecting to be for the quarter, even though we had obviously that really strong top line result. And so I think that's the impact of us heading into higher levels of inflation than we were even anticipating in the first quarter. And so I think our outlook for inflation for the year, I'll kind of break that into a couple of pieces. I think if you look at the U.S., we certainly believe we're on a downward trend, although inflation remains elevated. So if you look at commodity inflation on the food and paper front in 2022, we were in the mid-teens level in the U.S. This year, we think it will be mid- to high-single-digit. I think labor inflation will still remain elevated just on the back of a really continued strong labor market. And then I think if you move to Europe, from a food and paper commodity standpoint in 2022, we were in the mid-teen levels in Europe, and we expect to be in the mid-teens again in 2023. So I would say Europe, we still feel is kind of working through what I'll call the eye of the storm, so to speak, from a headwind perspective. Certainly believe inflation is front half versus back half-loaded and certainly believe as we get into the back half of the year, we'll start to see inflation moderate down but still really elevated in Europe. So I think if you go back to operating margin for the first quarter, we finished at 46% on the back of that really strong top line. And I think as we've said pretty consistently in the past, we certainly continue to expect that if we can drive strong top line growth, we should get leverage on operating margin from a percentage perspective as we go forward. Certainly, don't necessarily believe that will be necessarily linear. And I think there's a lot of headwinds for us to continue to work through both from an inflationary standpoint, but just as Chris talked about earlier, just from that macro uncertainty that we know we need to navigate. So I think certainly, you can kind of see a path forward where operating margin could come up a little bit from where our guidance is today if we continue to see that strong top line result over the course of the rest of the year, but there are several ifs there. And I think there's just a lot of headwinds for us to navigate that we remain cautious on.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Ian, just a clarification on your margin guidance. I just want to make sure I'm clear. The 45% you call out for the EBIT margin guidance, is that a GAAP or a non-GAAP number? And the reason I ask is Q1 typically is your seasonal low quarter for operating margins. So I just want to make sure we all understand that. And then secondly, Chris, I guess your comments about some of the consumer behavior you're seeing change with respect to items for order and otherwise, I wanted to understand that a little bit better. Are you starting to see that emerge as you exit the first quarter and enter the second quarter? Or was that something you saw in the quarter overall? And perhaps, could you just comment on how you're feeling about the business as you enter the second quarter specifically? Thanks.\nIan Borden: So I'll take the first bit on the clarification, David. That's a non-GAAP, the 46% I talked about is a non-GAAP number.\nChris Kempczinski: And then to your question about consumer behavior, the transaction, I believe we talked about this on the last call. Mike can correct me if I'm wrong. But we were seeing pressure on units per transaction even last quarter. That continued into this quarter. So I wouldn't say that, that is in any way a new development. That's been something that we've seen, which does just give us the perspective that certainly the customer is being mindful about how they're spending their dollar or their euro or whatever the relevant currency is. But as far as outlook for the business, we remain very confident about how we're positioned. We remain confident, as I said in our press release, the demand, the consumer demand for our brand remains strong. So there's no change from our perspective in terms of how we're feeling about rest of the year. Certainly, we have in quarter 1 the benefit of lapping Omicron, and the whole industry does. We also, as I mentioned in our last call, had more favorable weather in January. So we had some things going on in January that from an industry standpoint, made this an easier compare. But our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect to continue taking share. We've been taking share pretty consistently now for several years. Our outlook is that we're going to continue to take share through the balance of 2023.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You called out delivery as one of the key drivers of comps during the quarter. And clearly, that's one of the more expensive ways to access your brand, but it does seem like consumers thus far have been willing to pay for convenience. So I just -- given the base case for a mild recession, I'm wondering what level of confidence that you might have that this channel could continue to be a driver of comp growth?\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks for the question. We are -- we have seen, as you know, historically very strong performance from delivery. I think it is fair to say that the growth of delivery whether that's a function of it just being at a large number now or if it might, in fact, be some of the consumer pressures, but the growth of delivery has certainly slowed. There is still growth, but it's not nearly the growth that we saw previously. So I think as we look at it, delivery is going to remain an important part of the business, but it's certainly not going to be the degree of growth driver that it has been historically, which goes back to why having a very balanced playbook, where you're getting growth from multiple levers is so important.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jon Tower with Citi.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious on the $100 million to $150 million in rental abatement that you're offering to franchisees in Europe, how many of those franchisees have actually taken you up on the offer? And what you might be asking of them in return going forward? Are you maybe asking them to hold the line on pricing to the extent you can?\nIan Borden: Yes. Good morning, Jon. Thanks for the question. I think I just would reiterate how we've talked about that support previously, which is, I think it's targeted, it's temporary. And it's designed to go to the owner operators that are most in need. As we've talked about, I think the more acute kind of headwinds that our system is dealing with are mainly concentrated in Europe. So that's where the majority of the support that we've put in place is going. I mean, the support that we're providing is nothing new. We provide support around our system when the conditions and context warranted. It's obviously just a little bit more significant this year just because of the pace and I think the acuteness of some of those headwinds that are being worked through. I think it's one of those strategic advantages that you've heard me talk about before that we have as a system because we've got the financial capability to do that. And it's, I think, designed to recognize the headwinds. And we always knew that, that kind of -- the main pressure point would be in the first half of 2023, which is what we're seeing. I think it's designed to ensure that our system stays focused on executing our plan, stays aligned and proactive on investing in the strategic growth opportunities that we know we have, which I think will certainly be an advantage as we kind of get through these short-term pressures in the underlying momentum our business will have as we exit and take us forward as we get beyond '23. And I think we've seen a good engagement from our franchisees in terms of the support we're providing and how we're working together to bring that to life.\nChris Kempczinski: I would just add, our message to franchisees in Europe, in this case, but it goes back with the same message that we delivered during COVID, which is so long as you're doing the right things to drive the business in the long-term, if there are short-term pressures out of your control, we'll work with you to help and support you through that. That's very much an organization-by-organization, restaurant-by-restaurant decision. But what we want to do is we want to make sure that our system always remains focused on the long-term. And that's about ensuring that we're doing great service to our customers. We're running great restaurants. We're providing the necessary value. If you're doing all of those things from a long-term that you've got the benefit of McDonald's being able to help you if there are short-term pressures outside of your control.\nMike Cieplak: Next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you for the question. Congrats on the quarter. Can you expand on what you're seeing across your low, middle income consumers in the U.S. and where you think you're gaining share across cohorts? And then can you just break down the contribution to comp from guest count and average check? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. So we have the best data in the U.S. to be able to do the analysis that you're talking about. And the headline is we're getting share performance, share growth out of all income groups. So it's not that we're disproportionately benefiting from gaining share with low-income consumers, which I think was maybe the underlying question behind the question. We're seeing share performance, share improvement across all income groups, which makes us feel good about kind of where we're at from a value and a consistency standpoint. I don't know if, Ian, if you want to add.\nIan Borden: Yes. Maybe just a bit of texture I would add. I think as Chris touched on, I think what we're pleased about, particularly in the U.S., if we use that as the example, is just that balanced growth between check and guest count, probably two-thirds check, about a third guest count, I think if you look from a comp basis, on both sales and traffic, we know we are outperforming the competitive set. And I think it goes back to what we've talked about a fair bit today, which is just that really strong focus that we've got on value for money and affordability. Despite the pricing again that we're having to take in the context we're in, I think the discipline that both our owner/operators and our company restaurants are bringing to life and the pricing that we're doing is ensuring that we're kind of maintaining that healthy balance, kind of resonating with consumers despite their kind of individual circumstances and continuing to drive really healthy momentum as we go forward.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. First, I just wanted to clarify the comment you made earlier about a little bit of resistance from a consumer standpoint on pricing. I know you often refer to food at home versus food away from home. And it seems like maybe there are some limiting factors going forward where you might be encouraging more cautious price increases as we move through the year. So any color you could provide there as a clarification. Another one, I'm just wondering if there's any common theme in your conversation with franchisees. I know you have 5,000 worldwide, but there's always lots of chatter in the headlines. It seems like you said, significant returns, I mean, they're far exceeding the cost of capital, relative benchmarks, positive cash flow. I'm just wondering if there is any common theme of pushback from the franchise community? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: On price resistance, I think there is just -- it's a reminder about how we have to be very disciplined on where we take pricing. And we've built a very good capability over the last several years working with some external partners to know exactly by item, by restaurant, the ability for us to take pricing. And what we see is that when we follow that and we're mindful of the elasticities that we're able to get the pricing that we need through, and we've seen really no deterioration in that. But what we are seeing is when you go off script, when you go and you start to try to take pricing in areas that would not be suggested by all of our modeling that we are starting to encounter some more resistance there. And so just as a reminder that we need to stay very disciplined on pricing. The customer is certainly feeling, I think, some of the stress and pressures on that. We remain a great outlet for value and affordability. But we have to do it in a very strategic and a very targeted way, and we've got the tools to do that. As you said, we've got thousands of franchisees, roughly 5,000 franchisees globally. So it's incredibly difficult, I think to get it down to a sound bite of what we're hearing from any one franchisee or from any one particular country. But broadly, there certainly is a lot of concern around the inflationary pressure and an inquiry about when we expect that to flip and be more benign. It certainly is going to improve. Our expectation is it's going to improve through the balance of this year, but it's still going to remain elevated versus what we've historically been accustomed to. We've historically been accustomed to very low single-digit inflation. And I think our outlook for the full-year is it's probably going to be more like mid- to high single-digit inflation in the full-year but nonetheless, improving. So inflation, I think is an area of concern with franchisees that we're having a lot of conversations on. We're also having conversations around digital and just how do they think about what the restaurant experience is in a more digital environment. We have been having a lot of conversations around labor around the world. Fortunately, we're seeing the labor situations improving. In fact, in the U.S., they've made a lot of progress on staffing in the restaurants, which is partly what's driving some of the operations improvement, but labor was something that there was a commentary on around the world. And then as we've phased in our PACE program, as I mentioned, we put it in place in all of our major markets last year with the exception of the U.S., which started this year. But after three years of no grading in the restaurant and then you start grading, there inevitably is questions and in some cases, areas of feedback that we get. And we work our way through that. We did that last year in all of our international markets that implemented PACE, and we're seeing the benefit of that. Joe in the U.S. has been very consistent with the franchisees there that if after the first 90 days of rollout, if there are areas that we need to make adjustments, we'll do that. But overall, we're seeing great performance from a restaurant execution standpoint, and that's a credit to the franchisees, how they've gotten after labor, but also how they're just engaging with their teams at the local level.\nIan Borden: Maybe just a small build on that. I think as Chris said, obviously, when you're in a period of higher inflation and cost pressure, that's always going to be a topic to discuss. I mean, I think our job as a system and as McDonald's is to make sure that we've got a set of strategies and plans in place that's going to deliver that strong top line momentum. And I don't think you're hearing any lack of confidence from any part of our system about the strategies and plans that we've got in place. And I think as Chris touched on earlier, the proof point, if that's obviously the best way to work through any significant cost pressure environment, if you look -- the U.S. is a great example, obviously, not only in the results they're delivering, but in that first quarter proof point that Chris talked about where our owner/operator cash flow is actually up. That's what's going to get our system through these short-term pressures and ensure that as we come out of those pressures, we're going to be on the path to recovering margin as we go forward with that strong momentum behind us. And I think that's certainly what we're all focused on delivering against.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, great. Thank you. The question is on your pricing relative to the informal eating out market. I think you're always very clear that you want to stay competitive with that. But there typically is more inflation at food at home and more deflation at food at home. It's actually a lot more volatile than food away from home pricing, at least looking at the U.S. So do you think there is anything that's changed in the environment that maybe makes the McDonald's brand specifically less at risk to kind of lose any traffic, lose any transaction count to food at home, would presumably it becomes deflationary at some point in the near-term as kind of the first part of the question. And secondly, in terms of the customer promotion within the McDonald's app, the customized promotion within the McDonald's app, how effective do you think that is? Where are we in that overall journey in terms of customized promotion that is going to drive an incremental purchase, incremental profit versus still being done in some fairly general terms with some opportunity to maybe refine that over time? Thank you.\nIan Borden: Yes, good morning, John. Let me start with the first bit, and then I think Chris will take the second part of your question there. I mean, I think from a pricing perspective, it goes back to what we've talked about a bit through the call today. I mean, I think we're always focused on ensuring we're delivering strong value, strong affordability, even more so, obviously, when consumers are under pressure as they are. I think currently, I think we certainly -- if you look back, I would say, when we get into these moments where consumer disposable income is under more pressure and they're having to think about moving to more affordable options, I think we are certainly a beneficiary of that as just because of our positioning on value and affordability. And I think strategically, if you go back and use the U.S. as the example, what we've done over the last couple of years to invest in the estate, to invest in our marketing and brand communication, to invest, I think in the channels where we're bringing our experience to life, whether that's digital and how we're connecting with our consumers, whether that's delivery, et cetera, I think we have a lot more compelling reasons to visit and advantage versus those around us. I think if you think of the food away from home and the food at home, I mean, I think the dynamics been in reverse over the last probably 12 to 18 months versus what you would see typically, meaning food away from home inflation has actually been lower than food at home. I think you're starting to see that shift back to more traditional kind of dynamics. But I think we feel good about how we're generally positioned against from a choice perspective for consumers even as those dynamics shift back. And I think you look at kind of the first quarter momentum, the fact that we've got that positive traffic growth that we're kind of outcomping the competitive set, I think are all strong indications of that. But I mean, it's work ahead that we need to stay focused on to ensure that we kind of maintain our positioning from a value and affordability and ensure we're delivering a better experience, as Chris touched on earlier, to ensure that we're kind of earning every customer visit each and every time they need to make a choice on where they're going to go. To the second part of your question, I think even though our digital sales are now roughly 40% of overall sales and about half of that being identified, it's still early days for us in our journey there. I expect that we're going to continue to see digital as a percent of the business grow. You look at China, where it's almost 80%, 90% of the business, it gives you an indication of potentially how high is up. As you get more and more of your sales on digital and as more and more of your customer base becomes identified, I think you can get much more specific around how you're delivering personalized value. And I'll just give you one example. I love our McChicken Sandwich. I order our McChicken Sandwich all the time. I should never be getting, and I say this to the team, I should never be getting on my app on offer for the McChicken Sandwich. We're not yet at that level of sophistication, but we're going to get to that level of sophistication. And so as you think out to the future, I think all of the things that we're doing right now, we're laying a foundation for a very intimate, close connection that we have with our customers. And as we do that and as we get more and more identified, I think it's going to allow us to get much more sophisticated about how and when we're delivering value into whom. And for what purpose? Is it to drive frequency? Is it to drive reach? All of that is to come. We're in very early stages today.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. We're at the bottom of the hour. That completes our call. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day."}], "2025": [{"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 3, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-10-29 11:57:08", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Third Quarter 2024 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.

Mr. Meader, you may begin.\nScott Meader: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to sharing our third quarter performance and the progress we have made on key initiatives against a challenging backdrop for the QSR sector. Before I do that, I want to address the recent E. coli cases related to slivered onions in a handful of US states. While the situation appears to be contained and though it didn't affect Q3 numbers, it's certainly an important development, which I know is on many of your minds. For over 70 years, McDonald's commitment to food safety has been uncompromising. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and we've been proud of our industry leadership in this area. The last serious public health issue in the US associated with McDonald's occurred more than 40 years ago. The recent spate of E. coli cases is deeply concerning and hearing the reports of how this has impacted our customers has been wrenching for us. On behalf of the entire system, we are sorry for what our customers have experienced. We offer our sincere and deepest sympathies and we are committed to making this right. One of our core values is to do the right thing and that has been and will be our guide as we address this situation. After the CDC first informed us of the investigation, we were able to quickly link the cases identified to slivered onions from one facility at our Taylor Farms supplier. We swiftly removed them from our supply chain. We understand from health authorities that slivered onions from Taylor Farms Colorado Springs facility are the likely source of contamination. McDonald's has stopped sourcing onions from this facility indefinitely. Importantly, the Colorado Department of Agriculture confirmed on Sunday that they did not detect E. coli in the samples of beef patties from our restaurants and have no further plans to test. This supports our investigation that ruled out Quarter Pounders patties as the source. Based on this information, we are confident we can return Quarter Pounders to menus. On Sunday, we announced that our beef suppliers are producing a new supply of fresh beef patties in the impacted areas and we expect all restaurants in the US to resume the sale of Quarter Pounders in the coming week. We are proud of our franchisees' unwavering commitment to food safety and for executing our stringent food safety procedures. Doing the right thing also means communicating openly and transparently. Our US President, Joe Erlinger, has been regularly sharing updates with the system of the actions we are taking and Joe will continue to do so as the investigation begins to wind down. As I said at the outset, serving customers safely is our top priority. We'll never compromise on that. I want to thank the health authorities for their strong partnership. I'm relieved that this situation appears to be contained and I remain confident in the safety of eating at McDonald's. Let's turn now to the update on our performance in Q3. On our last call, we shared the QSR sector had meaningfully slowed in many of our markets with industry traffic declined in several major markets, and that consumers, especially those in the low-income category, were choosing to eat at home more often. This trend continued in the third quarter. QSR traffic has remained pressured, reflecting industry-wide challenges. And while we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance so far this year has fallen short of our expectations. While the QSR industry has slowed, we recognize that there are still many factors within our control to impact performance guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy. We're encouraged by signs of progress in the third quarter and the more consistent market share traction we are seeing, especially in the US, which included strong compelling value platforms, which is fundamental to the McDonald's brand promise, menu innovation, which excited our customers with great-tasting food, and strong marketing prowess that drove engagement on higher-margin core items. We have spoken before about our customers recognizing us as the value leader versus our key competitors, but our value leadership gap has shrunk. In response, we have moved with urgency in partnership with our franchisees to improve our value offerings in most of our major markets. Some examples that have launched in the quarter are the \u20ac4 Happy Meals in France, 3 for \u00a33 in UK, and in Canada, we're providing value to our customers through price-pointed coffee starting at just C$1. And to provide our customers with simple everyday affordability they can count on, we are employing strategies that are designed to work together to generate sustainable guest talent-led growth and increase market share. As we have said before, we view good value as including both entry-level items and meal bundles at affordable price points. This means offering Every Day Affordable Price menus, or EDAP, in our markets. At McDonald's, we define EDAP as a platform with an assortment of items all priced at compelling entry-level price points, generally including breakfast, beef and chicken sandwich options. We will pair EDAP platforms with strong meal bundles to provide our customers with entry-level meals at affordable price points. Blending EDAP and meal bundles under a branded value platform allows us to invest in and build recognition and affinity with our customers. So, when they're thinking about an affordable option for food, we're top-of-mind, which is why we've been able to capitalize on branded equities like Loose Change in Australia and the Saver platform in the UK for over 10 years. Value and affordability will remain at the forefront of our conversations with markets around the world as we continue to monitor the environment and listen to our customers. We spoke last quarter about our belief that delivering value and affordability in markets will have a positive halo effect on the business. And that's a great segue into the work we've driven across the MCD growth pillars this quarter, where we see compounding effects between our value offerings driving traffic and our full-margin promotions growing average check. Recently, we launched the Collector's Edition campaign, which brought back some of our most loved keepsakes with a twist, giving fans a memory that they can hold in their hands. Running in over 30 markets, the campaign featured core equities across all dayparts and drove high-check, full-margin traffic into our restaurants. Collector's Edition captured our fans' attention while keeping operations simple and giving customers more reason to purchase core menu items. The campaign drove customers to our restaurants, especially in the US where the promotion ran alongside the $5 Meal Deal. Collector's Edition maximized the power and scale of our global brand, while ensuring local flexibility and cultural relevance to connect fans in unexpected ways. Similarly, the UK&I market leaned into a One McDonald's Way for creative excellence by tapping into a winning formula starting in our US market. The UK's near-sellout of the Grimace Shake promotion in 48 hours is proof that when we share and scale world-class ideas across markets, we can maximize impact and have our creative work harder for us. Australia also followed suit by bringing Grimace Down Under at the beginning of October with both the world-famous Grimace Shake and the Grimace Meal. And that same formula, listening to our customers, investing in innovation, and pairing that with fresh marketing ideas is working across our core menu offerings as well. We have spoken at length regarding the potential of chicken, which is a massive category worldwide that's twice the size of beef and growing much faster. There is significant room for us to grow our share and we're working to meet the moment and take advantage of its growth. We have continued to see strong progress this quarter with the majority of our largest markets growing share. The US took an exciting step to evolve their menu offerings at the beginning of the month with a limited-time, full-margin offering that has proven successful across several markets in prior years, the Chicken Big Mac. And our plan to scale the McCrispy equity across nearly all our markets by the end of 2025 is on track with the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich that is expected to be available in over 70 markets by the end of 2024. Chicken isn't the only focus in our menu innovation efforts. The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer taste and delivering. We're encouraged by the results showing the Big Arch has universal appeal with sizable opportunity across markets. And thanks to the success of the pilot, we're accelerating plans and will work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025. Finally, as we consider our 4Ds, after a successful pilot of Ready on Arrival, or ROA, in the US, we are working with the rest of our top six markets to deploy this technology by the end of 2025. We know from the US that ROA helps not only with smoother restaurant execution as crew can better sequence in the kitchen, but also drives higher customer satisfaction scores by reducing wait times. And by building one of the largest loyalty programs in the world in just a few years, system-wide sales to loyalty members in the quarter totaled nearly $8 billion globally, with our aim to reach 250 million active users by the end of 2027, well within our reach. We continue to demonstrate how markets are getting smarter and closer to the customer by employing a multichannel strategy. We know as we drive loyalty adoption, we increase the frequency of visit and the spend from these customers over time. Despite the external challenges we are facing, the bright spots we see in execution and performance are clear indications that Accelerating the Arches is the right strategy to grow our business over the long term. We know we have more work to do to sustain guest count-led growth and continued market share gains, but I am very confident in our growth strategy and our ability to deliver outstanding execution for our customers. Now, I'll turn it over to Ian.\nIan Borden: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We acknowledge that our performance so far this year has fallen short of expectations, with negative global comp sales for the quarter amid a challenging industry environment. However, US comp sales were positive for the third quarter, which was driven by taking action on what we can control, providing compelling value, generating menu excitement, and using the full power of our marketing. As a result, the US outperformed the QSR industry comp sales and comp guest counts for the quarter. In fact, this quarter's comp guest count gap to most near-end competitors was the highest since the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through a combination of more compelling value through the $5 Meal Deal, alongside great marketing such as the Collector's Edition campaign, which delivered a significant increase in average check for its two-week run before selling out. Consistent with what Joe said last quarter, we wanted to see three things from the $5 Meal Deal: first, improve brand perceptions around value and affordability; second, making sure it connected with the single user, especially the lower-income consumer; and third, a shift in guest counts to drive both the short- and long-term health of our business. The $5 Meal Deal has done just that and continued drawing customers back into our restaurants throughout the quarter, maintaining an average check north of $10 and being profitable for our franchisees. We saw increased traction, particularly with low-income consumers successfully growing traffic share with this group for the first time in over a year. That is why, together with our US franchisees, we've committed to extending the $5 Meal Deal into December as we work towards sustainable guest count-led growth. Looking forward, our US leadership team is solidifying the details behind the future US value platform, working together with our franchisees to get it right for our customers by blending the best thinking from around the world as well as our own history in the US. We have plans to introduce the more holistic US value platform in quarter one next year. While value has been at the forefront of conversations, we have remained laser-focused on running great restaurants. We ignited our restaurant crew's competitive spirit in the US by running competitions aimed to increase guest counts, improve the speed of service, and refine our digital execution, and it worked. The US customer satisfaction scores reached an all-time high and service times at the drive-thru have dropped by double-digits compared to last year. This focus on operational excellence was also true internationally, where across all big five IOM markets, we increased customer satisfaction scores compared to last year. And while we will continue to focus on ensuring we have the right price points for our customers, we will not forget about all of the intangibles that create great value, knowing that providing a great experience, particularly now is fundamental. Turning to our international business, our internationally operated market comp sales were negative for the quarter, reflective of the contracting QSR industry where customers continue to be more intentional with the dollars they spend, mostly driven by France and the UK. While we continue to have opportunity on value and affordability in France, we have started to see signs of improvement in market trends since the launch of the McSmart menu. We also know that we have an opportunity with families and the \u20ac4 Happy Meal, which commenced in late August, is providing an uplift to that category. We are working at pace with our franchisees in IOM markets to offer everyday affordable price menus coupled with entry-level meal bundles as we are not consistently delivering both in all markets today. We will continue to take a forensic approach to evaluating our offerings, acting with agility to ensure we are delivering against the expectations of our customers. We are beginning to see progress. For example, in the UK and Germany, we have grown traffic share in environments that have further deteriorated since Q2. The UK drove excitement amongst customers by providing compelling value propositions across all occasions with the return of the 3 for \u00a33 menu by providing a \u00a32.79 breakfast bundle and by capitalizing on consumer excitement through the launch of the Grimace Shake discussed earlier. And being further inspired by the success seen in the US, the UK recently launched a \u00a35 meal bundle to further strengthen value positioning. And in Germany, we saw another great example of layering on a full-margin item with the Big Arch pilot on top of an already successful McSmart platform providing halo effects to the business. And building upon McSmart's success, Germany enhanced this platform with the launch of an expanded McSmart menu at the end of September. This extended the range of affordable meal bundle options at different price points to meet our customers where they are and we are seeing a strong initial consumer response and positive incrementality. And in our IDL segment, positive comp sales in Latin America were offset by the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East, as well as performance in China continuing to be negatively impacted by weaker consumer sentiment and spending. As we have stated before, as long as the war in the Middle East continues, we expect our business to continue to be impacted. Turning to the P&L, adjusted earnings per share was $3.23 for the quarter, an increase compared to the prior year of about 1% in constant currencies. Despite the pressured consumer spending environment, we've discussed this morning, top-line results generated over $3.8 billion in restaurant margin for the quarter. And our year-to-date adjusted operating margin of nearly 47%, highlights the durability of our business model. Results for the quarter reflected lower G&A spend, primarily due to lower incentive-based costs and continued prioritization around current year run the business spend. We continue to invest in our strategic transformation efforts, focused on forward-looking investments that will drive long-term growth and efficiency. As expected, results also reflected higher interest expense. And we now expect the company's interest expense to increase by approximately 11% for the full year. And our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was about 21%. With respect to the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming the other aspects of our financial outlook for 2024 under the assumption that the public health situation that Chris spoke to upfront will not have a material impact to our business. And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase to the equivalent of $7.08 per share annually. This marked the 48th consecutive dividend increase, reinforcing our continued confidence in the Accelerating the Arches growth strategy and our ability to continue to drive long-term profitable growth for all stakeholders. We remain consistent in our commitment to our capital allocation priorities: first, to invest in opportunities to grow the business and drive strong returns; and second, returning remaining free cash flow to shareholders over time through our dividend and share repurchases. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, Ian. One of the things we're known for is our ability to innovate and grow our business at an unmatched scale, while still using our influence to help have a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. Giving back has been a celebrated part of McDonald's culture since the beginning. In the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, it has been incredibly challenging across the Southeast US. As a system, we will be contributing more than $2 million in direct and in-kind aid, which includes crew relief efforts and serving roughly 50,000 free hot meals to our most impacted communities across North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Thank you to our franchisees, suppliers, and everyone across the entire system for doing all they can to help those impacted in those areas. Furthermore, I'm extremely proud of the work the McDonald's system does on a daily basis to prioritize driving change toward a more sustainable and inclusive future. Recently, we shared that in 2023, we reduced barriers to employment for 2.2 million young people in communities around the world through training programs and job opportunities, two years ahead of schedule. And, we raised $53 million in 2023 through our roundup for the Ronald McDonald House Charities program. In fact, this year we are celebrating the Charity's 50th anniversary. Whether it's charitable contributions across all three legs of the stool and from customers, volunteering at more than 250 local chapters or product promotions benefiting the charity, the impact of RMHC and McDonald's partnership over the past five decades is profound and we are proud to be its founding and forever partner. When our system works together to put our customers and communities first, there are a few things we can't achieve. McDonald's is not a stranger to adversity, but we have always risen to the challenge and come out stronger as a business. While there is still work to be done when we execute with precision, whether through a sharp focus on delivering great value or by staying culturally relevant with global campaigns like Collector's Edition, we do succeed even in tough environments. This is why I am confident that Accelerating the Arches is fit for purpose and we have the right plan in place to make our restaurants and company stronger than ever. And with that, we can transition to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nScott Meader: Our first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks, and good morning. It should probably be said that you had done a great job in those four months leading up to this food safety issue and really stabilizing traffic with the 4 for $5, a lot of this might have seemed unlikely back in May or June. And then, it seemed like you're really reinflation the check with the Chicken Big Mac. So, obviously, a shame on many levels that this has gone down like this, but I guess the question now is, how can you adjust? How can you help the consumer move on from a marketing stance and maybe a plan going forward? I know you're not going to on a public call to share your monthly plans here, but what are some of the things that you can do or have done in situations like this to help improve the trajectory in sales and help the consumer move on after these food safety headlines? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Hi, David, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. And let me just say again that we are certainly very sorry if someone got sick at our restaurant for eating an onion that we used on our QPC. And I am relieved that I think we are now past this and on the road to getting back to serving our customers as we are used to doing. I think you raised an important point, which is how do we make sure that we are reinforcing the trust that we've earned over the years with our customers on food safety. And I'd say it starts with how we've handled this issue. And I think as you've seen, we have tried to be very transparent on this issue. We worked very collaboratively with the health authorities and we took very swift and decisive action. So, I think the first thing is just how we've handled the issue. Now that we're moving and we view it as being behind us, you're bringing up the second point, which is how do we get the momentum back in the business that we clearly saw leading up to this very unfortunate event. And I think there's a variety of things there. I think certainly, we're seeing success with the $5 Meal Deal. We're going to have food innovation as well in Q4. We're going to continue to be driving digital. And I think we stand ready to do more if we need to, to make sure that we are bringing the full resources of McDonald's to bear to reengage that customer. So you saw, out of COVID, we made some moves and we did some things to make sure that we could reengage the customer. And if we have to make some of those same moves in the US, we're prepared to do that. So, I think it's going to be a combination of getting back to what was working prior to this very unfortunate event and then supplementing it as needed with additional activity to make sure that we get that customer back into the restaurants.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. The question is on value, and I want to position it in a way that, in certain cases, McDonald's has talked about kind of one global solution to certain platforms. I mean, I think about the McCrispy, which is a global product, but value was something that was expressed within countries and even within a country, in a lot of cases, actually dependent on the app to communicate value on a personalized level to customers. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but I do sense a shift that value will kind of be communicated more on a global basis with items under a certain price point and combos, what have you, and that does seem to be a fairly significant shift back to what we were talking about in the past one to two years ago. So, I guess just relative to your expectations, what really did change from a value perspective that we're kind of thinking about more global solutions at this point? And can we get to a point when the app is really the driver of the value in the future, or is that something that is just going to take a little bit more time to come? Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Hi, John, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. It gives me an opportunity to just clarify. I can tell you absolutely categorically positively, value is done at the market level. We do not come up with global value solutions that then get top-down out to the market. It's something that's very core to this business, which is value, as you pointed out is inherently a local decision because of the local competitive set, things going on in that country. So, this has been and will continue to be something that is driven at the market level. I think maybe what you're seeing is we are getting better at sharing frameworks and strategies that are working. And when we find something that's working in one market, certainly it would be -- we'd be remiss if we didn't share that learning and opportunity with other markets to pick up on. So that's where you've seen things like McSmart, that's been picked up by a number of different markets, but with the execution varying underneath that. So, I think the way I would look at it is, we have a global framework on how we think about value and there's a number of different ways to deliver value. We talk about -- you need to have a strong EDAP platform, which means entry-level price points that can bring the consumer into the restaurant. You also need to have meal deal programs that would be like the $5 Meal Deal that you saw in the -- that you're seeing currently in the US. And then, you can overlay on top of that in-app offers, promotions, other things like that. So that would sort of be the general framework of how we think about value and what we have learned through all of our experience on what works, but how that gets applied is very much left at the market level.\nIan Borden: And maybe just to build John to Chris' points, which I think just because you talked about digital, I mean, digital certainly continues to grow in importance, but it's still a minority of our customers. And obviously, over the mid- to long-term, digital will become a much bigger part and then we'll obviously bring value to life at an individual level with a lot of data and insights, which allow us to really effectively target value that's most relevant for that individual consumer. But I think it's still going to be quite a while where front counter value, so to speak, is going to continue to be important. And obviously, right now, that's the area of greatest opportunity and why we're focused on getting that right, as Chris talked to.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to come back to any additional insights on the public health situation. I know you mentioned that you're not expecting it to have a material impact on the business. Just if anything, either kind of on latest trajectory, anything on expectations going forward, if I interpreted that comment correctly, or any other financial implications to call out here? Thank you.\nIan Borden: Yeah, good morning, Dennis. It's Ian. Let me deal with that one. And I think it's a good question and obviously one that I think is important to answer. So, just bear with me for a couple of minutes because I just want to give some upfront context and then I'll get back to specifically what you asked. I mean, I think, our US business has done a really nice job of kind of responding to the heightened expectations from customers around value and affordability with the $5 meal. And then, as Chris talked about, really combining that with great marketing execution through things like the Collector's Edition or as we saw in early October, LTO events or menu excitement like the Chicken Big Mac, and that's where we kind of get that one plus one equal to three outcome, which is more customers visiting and more of those customers spending more in those visits drive-in, check-in and obviously profitability. We talked about in the opening remarks that the US has significantly outperformed the QSR industry with comp, guest count, and traffic gaps at their highest point since the beginning of '23. And then, we also talked about that $5 meal doing exactly what we had kind of set out to have it achieve. Two of those things that I think are really important is, for the first time in over a year, we gained share with lower-income consumers, and we also saw that customers that were buying that $5 meal were also visiting us more frequently. So, if you think about us getting back to guest count-led growth, I think certainly those things were starting to come to life. We ended the third quarter on an upward trajectory in the US business. And then, obviously, we started our Chicken Big Mac LTO on the 10th of October. And I would say if you looked at just the first three weeks of October in the US business, we had comp sales of close to mid-single-digit positive and comp guest counts positive, just a little bit below that. So, a really strong start to -- a really strong finish to the end of the third quarter, a really strong start to the fourth quarter, when you consider that we were still operating in a very challenging broader industry context. I mean, I think, of course, as you would expect, there's been an impact in the US business as a result of the food safety incident, and that positive momentum that I just talked about, we saw that shift to kind of having daily negative sales and guest count results since the beginning of the food safety incident. I mean, I think as Chris talked about, our focus has been on obviously moving swiftly and decisively, working closely with all the relevant health authorities to protect consumers, getting to a clear understanding of the root cause, and obviously trying to bring clarity for everyone as quickly as we could. And certainly, now that that's been addressed, as you heard Chris talk about, we're working to kind of get Quarter Pounders back on our menus and all of the limited number of restaurants that were impacted. I think what I would say is we certainly believe the most significant events are behind us and the work to do right now is focused on restoring consumer confidence, getting our US business back to that strong momentum that I just talked about. I think we're really confident in our ability to do that.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Just maybe to follow-on the last comments, Ian, and maybe Chris can comment on this. With respect to the advertising message that you're thinking about over the next three to six months, a lot of it's been focused on value and you've had success there and some great initiatives, but I'm wondering if you think some of those dollars are going to need to be allocated towards a message about the brand and restoring sort of the confidence in the brand fundamentals as opposed to being so focused on value and product initiatives, at least in the near term?\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah, thanks, David. We're going to do what we need to do to get the growth back into the business. And certainly, if there's an aspect of that, which is around reassuring the public, we're prepared to do that. I think I don't view it as an or, I view it as an and. I think we can do both. I think we can make sure that we're communicating the steps that we've taken and if there is lingering unease out there to be able to address that. At the same time, I think we can also continue to be driving value and I think we can be driving marketing news. And so, one of the things about McDonald's is we have, I think, ample resources to address whatever the business opportunity is, and we're prepared to do that. I know the US team right now is actually, over the next couple of days, engaging with our franchisees, thinking about what our plans need to look like, and I'm sure this will be a topic of conversation. But we're going to do what we need to do to make sure we've got to get the momentum back in the business.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ian, I appreciate the comments just kind of on the US, recently. I guess some of the other pieces in 4Q, and I know you're kind of sticking to the overall annual guidance for the most part. Do you -- should we infer though that there is -- you are seeing kind of some traction in IOM and IDL and you think that there can be some sales momentum there as we go into the fourth quarter? Do you think that SG&A is still kind of similarly favorable as we saw in 3Q? And just any other kind of key moving parts as we think about the last quarter of the year?\nIan Borden: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. So, I think a couple of things. I mean, I think on, in the IOM markets, as you heard us talk about in our upfront remarks, I mean the industry environment remains challenging. There's no doubt about that. I mean, I think consumers are under pressure. The industry is contracting in a number of our largest IOM markets. And in fact, that contraction worsened in the third quarter in several of those markets. Obviously, as a result of that, I think consumers continue to be discerning with where, with whom they're spending money and some of those consumers are certainly choosing to eat out more often. I think the consumers -- I think while there's broad consumer pressure, I think certainly lower-income consumers and families are consumers that are under more acute kind of pressures, I think on disposable income, obviously, two really important parts of our consumer base. I think for all of those reasons, it's why, obviously we have such a heightened focus on value and affordability, and making sure we get that right for the context we're in each and every one of our markets. I think the US results are a really strong data point that when we get that right, get that value and affordability proposition right, we're going to win in the environment we're in and we're going to obviously win better, I think than anyone else is doing and we know we can continue to drive better momentum even in those more difficult contexts. I think we're certainly seeing what I'll call some early signs of progress in several of our international markets, where we are seeing that our comp -- guest count or comp traffic gap versus our near-end competitive set is positive, but we want to get that in place in every one of our key international markets. We want that to be as strong as we feel the opportunity exists for it to be and we want to make sure that it's consistent. And so, I think there's more work to do on that front. Obviously, we're continuing to move at pace to get that in place. And I think you'll see a few more things coming in over the next quarter or so around that so that we are in a position to be best placed in '25 irregardless of the context around us. And we're going to obviously continue to measure our performance through, are we taking share irregardless of that environment. I think on G&A, look, obviously, when G&A, the metric is as a percentage of sales and you've got pressure on sales, there's going to be obviously some implied pressure on that G&A metric. I think we are trying to do everything possible. And as you saw, we expect to be able to continue to deliver against our guidance this year. We're doing that obviously because we've got some relief on kind of the incentive-based part of G&A, but we're also being very disciplined in our current year spending in areas like travel, meetings, professional services, all the things that you would expect us to be doing in the current context while continuing to invest obviously in our enterprise transformation efforts and the strategic growth opportunities that we have in areas like digital and technology, which we know are critical to ensure we have a strong growth pipeline as we look forward.\nChris Kempczinski: Yeah. I would just add, and maybe reiterate what Ian said, we are seeing a tough industry, UK, France, Germany, Australia, those are all markets where the industry traffic is down. That said, we are either gaining share or seeing sequential improvement in all of our major markets, which is encouraging. But I would also tell you, I'm not satisfied with the pace. And I think there's more that we need to do to step up and accelerate. There's a number of adjustments that are being made in each individual market to augment their value programs. And I think we have an opportunity to overlay on top of that some stronger marketing efforts as well. So, seeing progress, but I'm not fully satisfied with the pace on international, and that's the focus for us as we close out this year is making sure we get off to a fast start in 2025.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. A clarification and a question, please. The clarification is just you talked about the average check at $10 for those checks that have a $5 meal. I think though that might be lower than what your -- overall your aggregate -- your average averages, if you will. So, as you think -- as you launch this kind of holistic value platform, should I be thinking about perhaps a negative mix headwind for the -- maybe the year ahead just as there's sort of a reset in ordering pattern, I mean, with the recognition that your traffic gains are certainly the -- should be and are the priority? So that's a clarification. And then, just a question on -- it looks like McOpCo margins were a bit lower than we expected, maybe because of value, but maybe because of deleverage. Is there anything in this margin dynamics or sales trends that your franchisees are seeing that would change how they think about adding new units as you look to accelerate unit growth? Thanks.\nIan Borden: Good morning, Sara. Let me start on that and then I'll let Chris weigh in if he wants to add anything. I think on the $5 meal, as you picked up a check north of $10, that is slightly below our overall average check in the US, but we consider that to be a really strong check when you look at obviously the $5 price point. I think if you go back to what I talked about a little bit earlier, I mean, obviously, what we're trying to do with stronger value and affordability is drive more traffic and more guest counts. And as we bring more traffic and guest counts into the restaurants, we're pairing that with things like the Collector's Edition or the Chicken Big Mac LTO, that's where we're going to get that check growth and profit growth. So, we're not worried about that maybe that -- let's call it that value component, because at the end of the day, we've got to have that in place, I think, to be competitive and to drive market share progress and we feel really good that if we -- as we execute on marketing -- great marketing, as we execute on great menu news, that's where we're going to get consumers spending more, which will drive obviously the check and profitability as we saw towards the end of the third quarter and as we saw in the start of the fourth quarter, as I talked about earlier. So that's the dynamic there. On McOpCo margin, you're right, they did come in, obviously -- it did come in on a percentage basis, a little lower in the third quarter. I think there were a number of things at play there. Obviously, we still have pretty muted top-line growth, which is going to put pressure on margin from a percentage standpoint because we still have cost impacts that are hitting the business. I think if you just use the US as a specific example, we've got just above kind of mid-single-digit wage pressure, which is obviously coming in large part from the more significant increases in California earlier in the year, plus obviously overall wage increases, so you've got that pressure. You've still got commodity pressure even though this year we expect '24 increase in commodities to be in that low single-digit range. We've got some carryover impacts from higher inflation rates in '23 through the first part of the year, and still some increase there. So, you've got cost pressures, more muted sales growth. And then I think for sure, there's a little bit of an impact from I think the affordability positioning. I mean, obviously, that's an investment, a short-term investment that we think is really important to make because obviously, we grow margins and we grow profitability by growing volume and we want to be in a position to be able to do that. And clearly, that $5 meal is doing exactly what we want in that area. So, we feel really confident about our ability to grow margin percent over the mid- and longer-term as we drive that stronger traffic and volume growth in the business.\nChris Kempczinski: Maybe I'll just clean up the one other thing that you asked about, Sara, which was around development. And right now, we're seeing good returns on our new units. As we look at the US, we're on pace to hit our development goals in the US. It's certainly something that we pay very close attention to, but right now, from our vantage point, we don't see any impact to our development goals. And as you know, as we've talked about on prior calls, this is something that we spent a fair bit of time looking at it and being pretty detailed in our assessment of the opportunity and we make these decisions over a longer time period. There will be ups and downs with the business, but from our vantage point, the long-term development opportunity that we saw in the US that stays intact.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for the question. Just as a follow-up to that with regards to the $5 meal, on the last earnings call, it seemed like the traffic lift was more than offset by the lower mix as the consumers trade down, but as we move through the quarter, I'm guessing those comp dynamics shifted more favorably as it was paired with the Collector's custom more recently with Chicken Big Mac. So, if you can comment on that and discuss how that experience is shaping the discussion with your franchisees around the more permanent value contract that I think [you said slated] (ph) for the first quarter?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. As we talked about, I think what we've seen is, it's a pretty simple formula at the end of the day on what you need to do to get that good balance of traffic and sales growth in the business. You need to, at the foundation, have a strong value proposition, and that's been the focus for us in a number of our markets, either strengthening, adding to, adjusting our value programs so that we have that good foundation. You need to then overlay on top of that food news that can excite the customer and you have to have great marketing behind it. And when you do that with news and great marketing, you can get a strong full-margin check that goes along with some of those value programs. And I think that's exactly what we saw in the US. You had the $5 Meal Deal, but you also had things that were growing margin in check getting added on top of that. So that's the focus for us in all the various markets is strong value programs, great food news and innovation paired with strong marketing. And if we execute and do that well, which by the way is the essence of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, when we do that well, the business responds.\nIan Borden: And maybe just the only kind of build I would make on that is if you just go back to, I think what Chris talked about in his opening remarks, so if you look at food news like the Big Arch that we've had in three pilot international markets for the last several months, where we're seeing really strong results. So again, I think there's certainly demand from consumers for that exciting food news when they visit us, obviously, they still are buying and these promotions or activities when they're done well are resonating really well. I mean, you heard us talk about the Collector's Edition where we ran through that in two weeks because the demand was just so strong. We saw incredibly strong demand in the first couple of weeks of October for Chicken Big Mac. So, consumers still want that excitement, they want great ideas and great food news, but obviously, for some of our consumers, they're just really looking for that value and affordability. So, we've got to get both of those in place and get them working together, as I talked about before, where we get that one plus one kind of equal to three overall outcome.\nChris Kempczinski: And I just would add, I think it was a question on a prior call about Big Arch given that it's a higher-ticket item in this environment, I think the question was, does a product like that resonate, and what we've seen in our three markets so far is, it's doing great. And that's why we've decided we're going to accelerate it into more markets next year. So, I think there's -- the consumer still sees it as a good value, albeit at a higher check, but they're also using it -- it's clearly meeting an unmet need and when we have good marketing behind it, that can be a nice add-on and complement to the overall ticket. So, those are -- that to me is just a great example of it's not all about the low entry-level price points, when you have good food news and marketing on top of it, you can get that check build that we've been talking about.\nScott Meader: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the sales impact of the food safety incident. Are you seeing the impact more concentrated in the affected areas in the Midwest or is pressure more broad-based? And then, just on the US comp, can you just talk about the composition across traffic, price, and mix during the quarter? And any additional commentary on what you're seeing across the low-, middle-, and high-income cohorts? Thank you.\nIan Borden: Hi, good morning, Lauren. Well, I think as you would -- as you would expect, for sure, there is a bit more impacted in the concentrated areas where the news and attention has been a little bit more specific, and I think they're obviously just with the broader news and lack of clarity early on, there's a bit of a broader impact as I talked about earlier. But as I said, you know, I think the most significant events are behind us now, and we certainly are fully focused on getting the US business back to the momentum that we were seeing at working hard to kind of restore confidence of all of our consumers. So, I think that's a focus. I think on the -- I guess the dynamics, I won't get into a lot of detail on that. I mean I think we've talked about a fair bit about that already in the call today. I think as I said, we exited the third quarter with stronger momentum, had a really strong start to the beginning of the fourth quarter. I think the $5 meal obviously continued to work well and I think that continued to resonate even more strongly as we work through the quarter. And then, as we were getting that kind of combination with some of the menu news and marketing excitement and execution that we were delivering, we were getting a pretty strong check lift as well at points, particularly kind of towards the end of the quarter and into the fourth quarter. So, I think those would be maybe a bit of the texture that I would give you.\nScott Meader: Our next call is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just following up on the US value component. It seems like the $5 value offer response has been encouraging. I'm wondering whether there's any key metrics you can share, whether it's the mix of sales that you see from value more broadly or whether it's the $5 menu in particular, or any detail on that share growth? I think you said for the first time in over a year you've seen share growth with that low-income consumer. So, any support around that? And just to clarify, I think you said a more holistic value platform in the first quarter of '25, kind of reminds me of maybe the prior $1, $2, $3 menu where the consumer has options to choose among a variety of items. So, any color you can provide in terms of directionally what you're thinking about what that means for a more holistic value platform in the first quarter would be very helpful. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Well, first on the elements of what we're seeing, I think Ian hit some of the key criteria that we're looking for, but certainly, when we launched the $5 Meal Deal, we wanted to see that it would improve value perception with the consumer and we've seen evidence of that. We wanted to see that it could engage the low-income consumer in particular. We've seen evidence of that. We wanted to see that it could drive guest counts. We were seeing strong evidence of that. And then, we were getting incremental check on top of that, that allowed us to have a positive lift between -- meaning that we saw comp sales growing faster than GC. So, all of those kind of key metrics that we had outlined at the outset of that program, we've seen that deliver. As you think about then what our longer-term value program needs to look like, we're not going to get into the specifics of that on this call. I alluded to that this is something that we're in active conversations right now with our franchisees on, but I think you can anticipate it's going to have a few components. It needs to have this EDAP component that we've talked about. It needs to have a meal deal component, whether that's a $5 meal deal or some other meal deal, that will be something that's included in it, and it needs to be able to incorporate some of the digital offers that we do. So, as you think about what this is going to look like, I think you can look to some of our other markets where we have platforms like either a McSmart or a Saver, where you've got a branded platform that can house all of these various individual value components. And I think that's what you should expect to see from us launching in Q1 of next year.\nIan Borden: Jeff, I just might add a bit on the first part of your question. I mean, I think as you heard me talk about earlier, I mean, we had a positive comp gap versus the industry on both traffic and sales during the quarter. So that would tell you that what we were doing was resonating with all consumers, obviously, not just lower-income consumers. And that goes back, I think, to what we've talked about a couple of times today, which is strong value and affordability positioning and exciting menu news and marketing execution. So, we feel the US did a very nice job during the quarter of resonating broadly with consumers. The specific data points that we've talked about already was just -- obviously, we've gained share with lower-income consumers, which is a really important part of our consumer base is for the first time in over a year. So, I think that's a very specific and important proof point. But I think also buyers of the $5 meal are visiting us more frequently. So, we're winning more visits. Some of those visits obviously going towards the $5 meal, but some of those visits going to other things on the menu and that's what you start seeing when you start getting consumers back into the restaurants on a more regular basis. So, I think we feel pretty good about the specific outcomes, but also the broader outcomes and those proof points.\nScott Meader: We have time for one more question with Jon Tower from Citi.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just following up on Sara's question earlier regarding store margins, I was hopeful that you could maybe provide some color on your thoughts into '25, given the dynamics that have played out this year in the market and some of the plans you have for value. And then, on top of that, just broadly speaking, how you're thinking about the brand's pricing power, more so in the US relative to other markets in the world, given the macro backdrop where it seems like we've got a mixed consumer with respect to demand and jobs? And just curious, do you think the brand can kind of price in line with inflation next year, or is it going to have to kind of track below?\nIan Borden: Great. Thanks, Jon. Well, look, I think on margins, I would just go back to -- if you think about the momentum that we have been able to drive in the US business through the third quarter and at least to start in October, it's that kind of momentum that's going to be able to drive margin growth, both in percentage and dollars. And I think as you've heard us say today, we feel really confident we can get momentum back restored into the US business to where it was. And as we do that, we certainly feel confident about our ability to drive margin leverage because at the end of the day, if we've got greater volume, that's what allows us to obviously drive margins over time. So, I would say we feel good about our ability to do that as we're able to drive sales. And I think as we look into '25, we certainly feel confident in that. I think in terms of pricing power, I mean, you've heard us talk a lot about the more challenging environment, particularly in our international markets. I mean, consumers are certainly remaining resistant to pricing, but there are obviously different ways to kind of get at pricing. There's obviously taking price increases, but we've also got the ability through great marketing through full kind of margin promotions or menu excitement, things like the Big Arch, where we can get more effective pricing by just obviously influencing our mix. And I think we're going to obviously continue to be thoughtful about incremental pricing action because I think there's a lot of resistance. I think that there's pressure as a result of that on flow-through rates. I think we still feel we can get pricing, but I think that is going to be at more conservative levels until we get the right momentum back in the business in each and every one of our markets. And I think that certainly then opens up more opportunities as we look forward.\nScott Meader: Okay. That concludes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. Thanks everyone for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 2, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-07-29 12:11:05", "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to McDonald's Second Quarter 2024 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden, and President of McDonald's USA, Joe Erlinger. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning last year, we warned of a more discriminating consumer, particularly among lower-income households. And as this year progressed, those pressures have deepened and broadened. The QSR sector has meaningfully slowed in the majority of our markets and industry traffic has declined in major markets like the US, Australia Canada and Germany. In several markets, we also continue to be negatively impacted by the war in the Middle East. These external pressures certainly weighed on our performance for the quarter, with declines in comparable sales globally and across each of our segments. But there were also factors within our control that contributed to our underperformance, most notably our value execution. For 70 years, McDonald's has defined value in our industry, and we are taking meaningful actions across the world to assert our leadership. The hallmark of a great company is its ability to perform in good times and in bad, and we are resolved to reignite share growth in all our major markets regardless of the prevailing market conditions. This won't happen overnight, but it will happen. The unique competitive advantages of McDonald's afford us many levers to pull, and we have the financial wherewithal to sustain our investments as needed. One area of strength is our restaurant teams who continue to execute with excellence to serve our customers and local communities, creating a better customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times and increase customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. And it's this relentless focus on execution that will give customers more reasons to visit our restaurants more frequently. Leading into the power of our core menu also leads to outstanding execution in our kitchens. Our deployment of Best Burger is a great example of this. Now deployed in over 80% of markets, the training and focus on the basics ensures we deliver the gold standard product our customers expect which is driving elevated taste and quality perceptions. We remain on track to have best burger deployed in nearly all markets by the end of 2026. And as we announced late last year, we continue to innovate across our core menu to address unmet customer needs with a more satiating burger that will provide great value for money. This new burger, which we're piloting across three international markets this year, includes two beef patties perfectly layered with melting cheese, crispy toppings and a tangy McDonald's sauce. It's a quintessential McDonald's burger with a twist on our iconic familiar flavors, named The Big Arch, we plan to attest and learn through the end of the year to gather learnings before scaling more broadly internationally. We continue to have a significant opportunity for growth in chicken a category that's twice the size of beef globally and growing at a faster rate. By featuring our beloved icons like McNuggets and McChicken, while driving growth in emerging favorites like McCrispy and McSpicy, our chicken sales are now on par with beef sales. The McCrispy Chicken sandwich is now offered in more than 55 of our markets around the globe and through our plans to further expand our McCrispy equity, we will continue to capture chicken market share. As we continue to build on our $17 billion brands across our core menu, our digital penetration also continues to grow. Loyalty membership has now reached 166 million members, pacing ahead of expectations as we work towards our ambition of 250 million members and identified users now represent 25% of system-wide sales. We know that engaged loyalty customers spend more and visit more often. And as a result, we're driving digital market share gains and continuing to build on our understanding of customer preference, personalization and behaviors. But as I said in my opening, we recognize that in several large markets, including the US, we have an opportunity to improve our value execution. Consumers still recognize us as the value leader versus our key competitors, but it's clear that our value leadership gap has recently shrunk. We are working to fix that with pace. Over the last several years, our system has sustained significant inflationary cost increases ranging from 20% to 40% depending on the market. As we absorb these cost increases in partnership with our franchisees, we look for ways to protect restaurant profitability via productivity efforts and selective price increases. These price increases disrupted long-running value programs and led consumers to reconsider their buying habits. In some markets like Germany, Spain and Poland, the flexibility of their value programs like McSmart have allowed them to quickly make adjustments that were embraced by consumers and drove market share gains. In other markets like the US with their $1 $2 $3 value program, a more comprehensive rethink has been required. Our US President, Joe Erlinger, is on the call and will share more about our plans in just a minute. The point is, we know how to do this. We wrote the playbook on value, and we are working with our franchisees to make the necessary adjustments. McDonald's competitive strengths are formidable and growing. Our brand is as strong as ever. Yet again, Kantar recognized McDonald's as the world's fifth most valuable brand and the number one most valuable non-tech brand. We're executing with excellence, and our restaurant operations are an area of strength. Our digital footprint within the industry is unmatched and growing as we build one of the world's largest loyalty programs, and we're flexing our investment muscle to accelerate new restaurant openings as we also build consumer restaurant and company technology platforms that will drive cost efficiencies and accelerate innovation. We do not take these advantages for granted, however, and we are committed to delivering for our customers and shareholders every day. Where our customers tell us we have value opportunities, we will address them. Listening to customers and staying agile led to the development of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, and I'm confident that it remains the right playbook for our business. Continued focus on gold standard execution and our growth pillars are the right actions to grow market share and return to restaurant traffic growth. To share more on the US segment, I'll now hand it over to Joe.\nJoe Erlinger: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. It's been a few years since I've participated in the McDonald's earnings call. And I want to start by reflecting a bit about the progress McDonald's USA has achieved since that call back in 2021. Over the past three years, we've significantly moved the needle in several areas, like loyalty, which has grown to over 20% of our US system-wide sales and over 37 million 90-day active users. We've also improved our chicken market share with the launch of McCrispy. As I said then, it was the accumulation of our decisions grounded in our values that continue to keep the McDonald's brand relevant for our customers, and meaningful for our people, providing a strong foundation for future growth. That continues to be our approach as we're now focused on raising the bar on our customer experience, considering our customers' current reality. Since the very beginning, and Chris touched on this earlier, we've earned our success through excellent QSC&V, quality, service, cleanliness and value. And as we've evolved our approach time and again over the years to match the changing expectations of our customers, we continue to deliver an exceptional customer experience today. In this last quarter, McDonald's USA delivered its highest-ever year-to-date customer satisfaction score. While I'll share more about the $5 meal deal in a moment, both the Bacon Cajun Ranch McCrispy and Grandma McFlurry promotions drove sales, along with cultural buzz and brand relevance. All said, our business performance reflects industry-wide challenges and current context, one where customers are making thoughtful choices about when and where they eat. And while we always work hard to provide value to our customers, they're telling us that they want to see and experience even more value from McDonald's. And we're listening as we remain laser-focused on providing great value to our fans this summer and beyond. So we tapped into ideas that already exist within our system. Our restaurants in Upstate New York have been running a local $5 meal deal that was highly successful, performing well with lower income customers and driving overall incremental sales. By leveraging learnings from within our own system, we brought this to life for customers across the US. We've seen a lot of enthusiasm and the number of $5 meal deals sold are above expectations. Trial rates of the deal are highest amongst lower-income consumers and sentiment towards the brand around value and affordability has begun to shift positively. To date, 93% of our restaurants in the US have committed to extending the offer even further into the summer. And there are other ways customers can experience great value at McDonald's. We continue to provide a steady stream of offers on the mobile app, including nationwide free Free Fries Fridays, where you can get a free medium fry every Friday with any $1 purchase on the app. And as we work through the important details of the future US value platform, we will continue to make decisions grounded in insights with the customer at the center. At the end of the day, we expect customers will continue to feel the pinch of the economy and a higher cost of living for at least the next several quarters in this very competitive landscape. So we believe it's critical for us to consider these factors in order to grow market share and return to sustainable guest count-led growth for the brand. McDonald's is uniquely positioned to succeed in this environment, given our size, scale and competitive advantages. We have a fully modernized restaurant estate. We have a simplified menu that focuses on our core while never shying away from bringing back fan favorites at the right times or pursuing the right new product innovations. We have built one of the largest loyalty programs in the industry and we're continuing to lead with a long-term mindset, making decisions that meet our customers where they are and where they need us right down, while also plotting a path for sustained success. And now I'll turn it over to Ian.\nIan Borden: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned at the top of the call, despite the very real near-term challenges facing the sector, we remain confident that our long-term strategy rooted in customer insights and built on our inherent competitive advantages is right for our business. When we combine deep insights with the power of our brand, we tap into what our customers love most about McDonald's, connecting with them on an emotional level through celebrating the rituals and memories that make our brand so special. At the heart of our brand are our local communities and the customers we serve each and every day. Strong restaurant level execution against our MCD growth drivers coupled with compelling value will be critical to giving customers more reasons to visit McDonald's more often. And as you heard from Chris and Joe, we're delivering higher customer satisfaction, and improve service times across most of our major markets. Our M, C and Ds are deeply interconnected and it's at the intersection of our growth drivers that we continue to deepen our relationships with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable restaurant experience while offering the delicious and affordable food they love. As Chris mentioned, we still have an opportunity to strengthen our holistic value proposition across markets, and we recently met with each of our largest markets, we're ensuring that we have a winning value offering with front and center in every discussion. We're taking a forensic approach to evaluating our offerings and acting with urgency and agility to implement solutions to deliver against customer expectations. Germany has continued their holistic approach to value with a 360-degree affordability strategy, including McSmart at the center and are consistently driving elevated levels of customer awareness. This is a best-in-class example of listening to the customer, designing a program that meets them where they are and ultimately delivering incremental sales, customer satisfaction and market share gains. As we scale best practices across the system, markets like France and Australia have adopted their own version of the McSmart platform, and early results have been encouraging. And in May, the UK offered smaller, more affordable bundles of their own with their 3 for GBP3 mix and match menu that resonated with customers looking for more affordable options and to address an opportunity to offer more compelling value at breakfast, which remains the fastest-growing day part in the market, the Canadian market recently launched a new price point at beverage value offering our customers the coffee they love every day starting at just $1. McDonald's has long been an affordable destination for communities to come together and share a meal but it's always been about more than just price. This quarter, we continued to elevate the experience, combining our delicious food with unique mobile app and in-restaurant experiences, ultimately delivering value, however and whenever customers decided to order and enjoy their McDonald's favorites. Germany leaned into the Easter holiday with a fun and interactive calendar promotion where customers enjoyed a daily deal available exclusively in the mobile app from discounts on our most iconic menu items like the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets to unique meal deals the promotion drove remarkable engagement and significant growth in loyalty sales. And Italy drove traffic to our restaurants with summer days, a similar seasonal calendar campaign featuring a variety of exciting meal bundles. And a local favorite, the frequent fryer program returned to the Canadian market this quarter. To engage loyalty members with a new approach to gamification, the market launched a nationwide scavenger hunt for fry icons, which could then be entered on the mobile app for free loyalty points or free fries. Nearly 3.5 million codes were entered throughout the promotion, driving meaningful lifts to the fry category. Even with strong execution against our Accelerating the Arches growth drivers, performance this quarter reflects a pressured industry landscape in the US as well as across many of our largest international markets. Our international operated market comps were negative, reflective of this broad-based pressure where customers continue to be more intentional with the dollars they spend and performance in France. And in our IDL segment, positive comp sales in Latin America and Japan were offset by the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East and a less confident consumer in China. Despite the pressured top line growth we've discussed this morning, we drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.97 for the quarter, a decrease compared to the prior year of about 5% in constant currencies. This was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate of nearly 21% for the quarter, elevated interest expense as expected and less other nonoperating income due partially to lower interest income. Top line results generated over $3.5 billion of restaurant margins for the quarter and a year-to-date adjusted operating margin of over 46%, highlighting the durability of our business model. This was offset by higher G&A due to continued investments in digital and technology as well as enterprise transformation efforts and costs associated with our biennial worldwide convention. As we've talked about before, driving long-term growth requires making the right strategic and forward-looking investments, and we are committed to continuing to invest in our platforms and growth drivers, while relentlessly prioritizing current year run the business spend. While we expect industry challenges to persist, we believe we are well positioned with the unique size and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide. There remains significant power in focusing on what's within our control, offering our customers delicious food at unparalleled value and convenience that will drive future market share gains and guest count growth. With this as our North Star, we believe we're poised to deliver long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now as most of you know, this is Mike's last earnings call with McDonald's. So before I close, I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Mike for his significant contributions to our brand. He served as a trusted adviser to our senior leadership team by playing a key role in developing and communicating our strategy. Mike has been at McDonald's almost as long as I have and his deep knowledge of our business and ability to foster relationships with stakeholders has been invaluable to me, especially as I've taken on the role as CFO. On behalf of everyone at McDonald's, Mike, thank you. We wish you all the best for the future. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. Earlier this month, we brought leaders together to discuss our goals and objectives as we further establish McDonald's as a leading global consumer brand. As a team, we are committed to act with urgency, cementing our value leadership growing share in areas like chicken and bolstering loyalty through digital customer acquisition, adoption and retention on a global scale, and we are continuing to lean into our three pillars, M, C and D as our blueprint and engine for growth while leveraging technology to transform how we operate across all platforms. Even as the world around us continues to change, we know the power of the McDonald's brand will prevail. We're digital forward, values-driven and culture-led and will continue to reinvent ourselves to meet our customers and restaurant teams where they are today and where they're going tomorrow. With more than 40,000 locations across the globe, we uphold a presence that we believe few in our industry could ever hope to match. We offer the best franchising opportunity in the world, offering a familiar beacon of support for the over 40,000 communities where we live, work and serve. And we're just getting started. We're making progress towards our ambition of 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027. And when we combine our strategy with great value and high-level execution, we are confident we will further our leadership position. As I close, I want to extend a sincere thank you to our franchisees, suppliers and employees around the world for their continued resilience and unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities. And with that we'll begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you very much. Certainly, McDonald's has access to consumer data, consumer information that almost no corporation in the world does. And when I consider six months ago, 12 months ago, it was fairly well known. The restaurant industry would see a fairly wide pricing gap versus grocery and many consumers would have drawn down their excess savings from COVID, that we would be in an environment where value quite frankly, would be more necessary. So I just wanted to get a sense of really what changed so significantly from the consumer's perspective relative to your expectations in the last 6 to 12 months? And if I can, how McDonald's kind of pivots itself from being reactionary from a value perspective from a consumer trend perspective, to more anticipating changing needs before they happen as opposed to after? Thank you so much.\nChris Kempczinski: Hi, John. Thanks for the question. You're right in that last year, you may remember we were talking about there being pressure on the consumer and particularly that low-income consumer that was notable in a few of our major markets. And what has happened in the intervening period of time is that we've seen more markets have the same sort of slowdown. And it is certainly most pronounced with that low-income consumer, but we're also seeing an impact with larger groups, particularly around families in Europe that we're seeing this as people are just looking to economize. You're also right that we're looking at a continued gap between food at home and food away from home inflation. The gap is about 3% right now or a 300 basis point gap between the two. So you are seeing consumers being much more discretionary as they treat restaurants. You're seeing that the consumer is eating at home more often, you're seeing more deal seeking from the consumer, and you're just seeing, I think, a trade down even within either units per transaction or within mix, all of those things for us are indicators that the consumer across a number of these markets is being very discriminating. And I would point out consumer sentiment in most of our major markets remains low. And so your point around how do we make sure that we're anticipating where these customers are going and what the value is required. I think it's a fair question. And what we've done is, in a number of places, you've seen us and heard us talk about what we're doing with McSmart, what we're doing with McSaver some of the things that we've put in place in the US. But I think it's also clear to us that in several markets in a number of markets that you need to have a broader value platform and that trying to move the consumer with narrow offerings that are one item or a few items is just not sufficient for the context that we're in. And so what's going on in markets around the world is looking at how do we further broaden what some of the value platform offerings could be as we also perhaps look for other places that we can dial down. And that conversation, as you know, with our franchisees, takes a moment, it's not something that happens immediately, but I would say that there's good recognition across our franchisee base that we need to be providing value. We need to be providing a broader level of value and at the same time, we've got a lot of other levers. So this is not all about value. We've got levers around what we can do from a menu standpoint. We've got some great equities that we need to be driving there. And there's more we need to be doing from a marketing standpoint and stepping up by marketing. So I'd say the changes that we're working on and talking about with our markets, yes, it's around value. It's making sure that as we're facing certainly a more difficult environment than even what we anticipated last year that we've got that value offering, but we're also using the other things that are at our disposal to get this business back to where we know it should be performing.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Congratulations, Mike. Thank you for your help all through the years. As far as the question, I guess, I'd like to focus on the IOM countries. How do the challenges in your key markets differ from the US in terms of market share versus the informal eating out sales trends? In the US, it feels like McDonald's is still in a state of searching and perhaps negotiating to find the right value message ahead of menu news that might happen later. Are you at a similar stage of searching and perhaps negotiating with franchisees about value overseas? Where are you in terms of how satisfied you are where you are in terms of the value message? Thanks so much.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, David. I'll have Ian start and then if there's anything I need to add, I'll do that. But Ian, I'll let you start.\nIan Borden: Sure. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Look, I mean, I'll just start, I think, with a bit of context, which is, as you heard Chris in his opening remarks, talk about, I mean, I think the pressures on the industry and consumers that we're seeing are broad-based in nature. And I think if you look across our IOM markets, which you will know historically, I think we've had -- have been a real strength to our system. I think that external pressure has heightened and I think certainly gotten more significant in several of those markets through the second quarter. And so I think it's still what I'll call an evolving situation. We've talked a lot about value and affordability over the last couple of quarters. As you know, we've kind of highlighted McSmart, which is an entry-level meal, affordable meal option that we put in place in Germany at the beginning of 2023 and Germany has been consistently one of our most strongly performing markets even in a much more difficult context over the last couple of quarters in the marketplace. So I think it's -- part of it is just the evolution of what's happening with the consumer, what's happening with the industry. I think we have strong alignment engagement with our franchisees across our international markets. I think we're working very collaboratively and constructively to get the right programs and platforms in place from a value and affordability standpoint. I think part of it's just been the landscape in the consumer is evolving and those platforms and offers have needed to be sharpened and I think better positioned to be delivering in the current context. And so I think we're -- we're moving with speed and pace, as you've heard us talk about before, but the environment, I think, has been changing and context has been evolving. And I think we're just trying to get ahead of that as we've talked about in kind of our opening remarks.\nChris Kempczinski: What I would just add is if you look at our IOM markets, the good news is if you think about Germany with McSmart, you've got Canada with McPick, you've got the UK with McSavers menu, Australia has McSmart and also Loose Change Menu, France has McSmart. We have the value platform established in those markets, and there's good consumer awareness of those value platforms. The work that's underway and Ian alluded to this is making sure that underneath those value platforms that we have the right items at the right price points to reflect where the market is at today. And so there are markets like the UK, for example, where they're making changes to the menu in France as well. They're adding a four-year happy meal. So there's changes that are happening underneath those value menus to make sure that we are appropriately positioned for what we see now as the market context. But the fact that we have those menu platforms established that there's good awareness on those I feel like that is a positive versus in the US, where obviously they're starting to do a little bit more work about what the long-term value platform is going to look like.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. .\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on digital, right? Because obviously, it's continued to grow. You've continued to add members there's actually a lot of really good value available on that platform, but it hasn't really offset some of the sales challenges that you're seeing right now. So I guess what gives you kind of the confidence that, that could change? Or what do you think needs to be done differently there? Do you think it's kind of resonating? And is that a place to continue to drive value going forward?\nChris Kempczinski: Yes, it's a great question. We feel really good about our digital business, and we're seeing strong performance on the digital business, as I alluded to in the opening. I think the challenge on digital right now is basically only about 25% of our customers are on digital in terms of identified customers. And so as you think about what you need to do to drive the overall business, we just don't have digital yet at the size and with the penetration that's needed to move the entire business. And I think some of what has happened as you started to look at things is we probably were a little over rotated on digital versus broad everyday value that we're offering available to all consumers, those who maybe aren't yet on our digital platform. So that's the work that's underway. I think in time, certainly, as you know, digital is going to continue to grow for us. We're going to get more and more customers on our digital platform. And I think in a couple of years' time, particularly as you get to 250 million users, that's a different conversation about how digital can drive value. But today, we just don't have the penetration where we need it to be to move to 75% of the business that's not on digital. And so that's the value work that we just have been talking about.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions on the US value initiatives. First, I was hoping you could elaborate on the effectiveness of the $5 meal deal that you're running and whether you're seeing the sales or traffic inflection you had anticipated from that program. And then secondly, I think, Chris, you mentioned it's necessary to have more of a platform idea in all of your key markets. And I'm just wondering, in the US, how those conversations are going with franchisees and whether franchisees are supportive of a broader national value platform and when that might happen? Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks, David. I appreciate the questions. Relative to the $5 meal deal, it's really performed and done exactly what we wanted it to do. First, we wanted to see a change and improved brand perceptions around value and affordability, and it's done that. We wanted to make sure that it connected with the single user, especially the lower income consumer. And we've seen that through increasing trial rates by that consumer base. Our two lowest income cohorts, the under $45,000 cohort and the $45,000 to $75,000 cohort, saw an increasing trial and participation around the $5 meal deal throughout the life of the promotion, which was incredibly encouraging. And then lastly, obviously, we wanted to see a shift in guest counts to drive both the short- and long-term health of the business. And ultimately, I believe, in guest count-led growth. And while it's begun to do that, it hasn't yet translated into sales. The average check though has been over $10 for the $5 meal deal. So we do feel comfortable about the add-on that's happening as part of that program. Relative to the longer-term platform, obviously, this is a big investment for us and our franchisees. When you think about the dollar menu, which existed for over 10 years and when you think about Dollar Menu 1, 2, 3 that's been in place now for over six years, we just need to be very thoughtful and considered as we work through what our national everyday value and affordability platform will be. That work is happening and good partnership with our franchisees. And so we're comfortable that we'll get to the right answer. There's no question that the franchisees see the impact and the importance of a national everyday value and affordability platform. And so we're working through that at pace with them. In the meantime, obviously, we're continuing to offer consumers great value with the $5 meal deal extending in 93% of our restaurants into August, and we're working with our franchisees to extend that even longer. We continue to offer great value via the app, which Chris just talked about a bit. We also continue to have a lot of local deals at what we call our business unit level. So we'll continue to squarely offer our consumers value throughout the summer and into the fall.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the sort of margin implications. And in particular, maybe talk about whether you'll need additional franchisee support for either US or IOM, specifically, I know we seem to be seeing actually some deflation in some beef trimming and other cuts, which is very different from what we have been seeing. So to the extent that you are offering more value, you'll have a permanent value platform. Is some of that funded by lower input costs such that maybe there's less margin pressure? Or is that something that you'll have to address with franchisees. I know in IOM markets, you had given some franchisee support. I'm not sure where that stands now. But is there any contemplation of again investing either behind franchisee or perhaps contributing to marketing fund. Anything from McDonald's corporate to help, I guess, lessen the burden. Thanks.\nIan Borden: Good morning, Sara. It's Ian. I'll start and then I think maybe Chris or Joe might jump in at the end. Look, I mean, I think as you said from a margin pressure standpoint, I mean, obviously, the top line performance has been more muted. So that obviously creates a level of pressure. But I think if you use kind of our McOpCo margins as a bit of a proxy you would have seen that they've held up pretty well through the quarter simply because, as you noted, we're certainly seeing much lower levels of inflation in areas like food and paper, which are down at the kind of low single-digit level. I mean, obviously, labor inflation, particularly in the US, is a little higher still, especially with some of the minimum wage changes in places like California. I think in terms of just kind of maybe kind of trying to answer your -- the broader part of your question, I mean, value and affordability is kind of a fundamental part of our business model. And I think our owner operators understand that and obviously understand that, that's something strategically that we always need to have in place as you would have heard us talk previously about, I mean we don't subsidize pricing. So we want to get to the right outcomes and do that on a way in a way that it's going to be sustainable and profitable for both our operators and for McDonald's. And I think over time, we know that strong affordability and value is what drives volume-led growth, as you heard Joe touch on and volume, obviously, is ultimately what drives sustainable profit and cash flow for the business and for the system. I think as we get some of these ideas in place, obviously, we want to bring them to life in creative and effective ways, and we're going to put all of the resources of our system against making sure that we execute this and put ourselves in a position to win in a difficult environment. But I may just kind of let Joe or Chris weigh in.\nJoe Erlinger: Yes. I would just add, I mean, our franchisees in the US are in a very strong financial position. And so they have the financial firepower, both in terms of cash flows as well as equity to make investments and they can make those investments across their P&L. If you actually look at gross margin in the 20 years pre-COVID, we're actually at a high right now versus those 20 years. So we feel very good about the ability of our franchisees to invest via their P&L or otherwise. And we are working through with them right now look at the overall profitability of the $5 meal deal. But we think they've got the ability to invest. And so we're comfortable with the position in the US.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. My only add is I just would underline the word that in use, which is sustainable. We're only interested in doing things that are sustainable strategies that we can continue. And so that's going to be our guide as we think about where we need to go on these things. And there is a lot of, I think, strength within our system, financial strength within our system to implement the necessary changes, but they have to be sustainable for us.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you, and thanks, Mike, for all your help, best of luck. I wanted to focus again on the meal deal. I appreciate all the insights there. Specifically, as it relates to customer awareness in the US of the meal deal and sort of thinking about the marketing message or the marketing intensity, is that something you could help us frame up for us where it is right now? Is it something that ramps and kind of related, just thinking about the time line generally from a new market -- a new value platform or a new bigger value offer to guest count contribution. Is there a way historically in environments like this to kind of think about how that time line looks. Thank you.\nJoe Erlinger: Yes. I think what we're learning from this is the power of our national voice McDonald's. As we exited 2023, we looked at the value that we had at a local level and felt very comfortable that, that value was compelling. But what we last was obviously a strong national voice and it took us some time to work with our franchisees to achieve that national voice. And as we talked about, the $5 meal deal is something that already existed in Upstate New York and when you look at -- when we apply that national voice, what happened in Upstate New York, which already had the deal, trial and participation rates actually doubled in Upstate New York. And so you also see then the power of the actual message, the importance of a message actually being price pointed. As you know, we have a BOGO, buy one get one promotion that we've run in January. And we saw a trial in participation rates for the $5 meal deal 70% greater than that January buy one get one window. So that is the power of national marketing, the awareness that brings. I won't get into specific numbers around awareness. But certainly, when we launch our new national everyday value and affordability platform, building awareness of that platform will be absolutely critical, just like we've done, obviously, in the past with Dollar Menu $1 $2 $3 at a dollar menu.\nChris Kempczinski: My only add on the PACE question is that ultimately is on us. There's nothing externally that drives the PACE. It's all an internal thing. And so we've seen in some markets like France, for example, where there's strong alignment, we can move very quickly in other places, it requires more conversations because of the breadth of the changes. But at the end of the day, we've shown the capacity to move quickly and my hope would be certainly that in a market like the US. I think Joe and the team are having great discussions with franchisees about the importance of getting to that value platform that we've talked about.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just looking outside the US, perhaps, I was hoping to touch on France and China. France, I'm just wondering if you think it's more of a McDonald's specific issue, which I think is what maybe you referred to in the past versus a macro issue and how you view the competition there. And then in China, I know you mentioned that consumer is less confident. I'm just wondering if you're seeing anything to give you pause on an otherwise aggressive unit growth outlook or maybe a change in strategy, whether you're seeing any US brand pushback or anything along those lines would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Well, starting with France, certainly, what we've seen in France has been a slowdown. But I think you're also accurate in reflecting that the fact is we're losing share in France. And that suggests to me that there is still an opportunity for us to improve our performance. A couple of things for us. One that we've talked about in the past has been it is a very competitive market right now. We're seeing a competitor there who's being aggressive on pricing. Certainly, that's one element. And I've talked about some of the things we're doing to enhance our McSmart menu to make sure that we're competitive on pricing. Second, because France has such a meaningful business with families. Families is key consumer for us over there. That's where they're coming back with the EUR4 happy meal, so that's addressing the family issue. And then we are also looking at what can we be doing to make sure that we're engaging with customers around where our brand is positioned. France is one of the markets that has a higher Muslim population. And so when you think about the Middle East, the impact that we're seeing in France has been more than maybe in other markets because of that population. So there's a lot that the team is looking at doing on how do we make sure we're telling our story from a marketing standpoint at the local level. But I think it's fair to say that we have an opportunity to get back to share growth in France. The market has slowed down, but the market is still delivering modest, very small growth, and we want to participate more in that. In the case of China, China is a very competitive environment right now. And as you've seen from a number of other consumer companies, it is highly promotional. Consumer sentiment in China is quite weak, and you're seeing both in our industry and across a broad range of consumer industries, the consumer being very, very much deal seeking. In fact, we're seeing a lot of switching behavior in terms of just consumers, whatever is the best deal. That's where they end up going. Positively in that environment, one, we're holding share. So our business in China is holding share. And the second thing that I would say is that we are still seeing good returns on our new unit openings. So there's, from our vantage point, a lot of runway around growth on new units. And we are laser-focused on the returns that we get from new units. If those were to ever dip below what we would consider to be an acceptable return threshold. We would certainly relook at our opening pace in China. But right now, what we're seeing is that the returns on new openings are holding up. And so from our vantage point, the 1,000 restaurants per year base that we've been on, we're still working toward that number in 2024.\nJoe Erlinger: Jeff, I might just hook on to Chris because I just want to -- I know you were asking about France, but I think it is important just to kind of reinforce a little bit of what we touched on earlier, which is, I mean, I think the external trends and pressures that we're seeing on the industry on the consumer, I think, are broad-based across IOM. I think consumers are being, as you've heard us say earlier, more discerning about where, when and what they eat. And I would say we don't expect significant changes in that environment for the next few quarters. So obviously, as you've heard us talk a lot about, we're kind of laser-focused on this forensic review of kind of our value and affordability positioning in each of our key markets. We're going to position ourselves to win, and we're moving, I think, with a sense of urgency, but obviously, at the pace to get that right. And as you've heard us talk a lot about, we've got the system strength and know-how to push us in that winning position. I would just say, I think the third quarter has certainly started similarly to how the second quarter ended, and we're seeing, I think, negative comp trends across IOM and frankly, across each of our three operating segments.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, good morning, and thanks for the question. I'm just curious about trade down. In the past McDonald's was thought of as a defensive option because in economic downturn, it would pull share from more expensive categories. So I'm just curious why you think you might not be getting the trade down that you depended on in the past? And whether that's a function of value perception or something that could be addressed in the new value construct. Thanks.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. Thanks, Eric. Well, I think we are seeing trade down, but what we're seeing is that the loss of the low-income consumer is greater than the trade down benefit. And so you're seeing with that low-income consumer, in many cases, they're dropping out of the market, eating at home and finding other ways to economize cutting down on trips. So we are seeing the benefit of trade down, but it's just not enough to offset the pressure that we're seeing on that low-income consumer.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\nLauren Silberman: Hey, thanks you, guys. I wanted to follow-up on how you're thinking about comps in the back half of the year. So quarter-to-date still running negative. Should we -- are you expecting that to, I guess, continue through the third quarter when can we start to talk about positive comps in the back half of the year? Is it fourth quarter as a base case right now? Any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.\nIan Borden: Hi, Lauren, it's Ian. So just maybe just to reiterate a few things. I mean, I think, as I said, the pressures are broad-based. We're seeing those pressures, I think, on the industry and on the consumer across almost every one of our large owned markets globally. And as I said, I don't think we -- I don't -- we certainly don't profess to have a, I think, a crystal ball on how the future will look like, but we don't expect that we're going to see a change in that environment over the next few quarters. I mean, I think that's why we're laser focused on getting value and affordability right. As you heard Chris just say, I think it's not even so much about consumers moving from us to others. It's about consumers in that low-income category. And I think families, which are obviously two big cohorts of our consumer base across most of our markets, just eating out less frequently than they have been previously. I think we're confident that if we get our value and affordability propositions, right, if we get them into that winning position in each marketplace, that will encourage consumers to come back when they can. And I think if you take examples of what some of our markets done, I'll use the UK as a bit of an example that ran a campaign in the end of May, beginning of June, a 3 for GBP3 mix and match campaign. They also have done a GBP1.99 Happy Meal offer in the app. When we run compelling affordable options like that, we know we're able to draw consumers back and we know we are best positioned to be able to do that. So that's certainly what we're focused on. As I said, certainly don't claim that we can predict. I think when the environment will turn or when the consumer will turn. I think what we're focused on is making sure that we're winning in the current context in each and every one of our markets. And that we're positioned to accelerate our momentum as this challenging environment begins to turn in each and one of our markets as we look forward.\nChris Kempczinski: Yes. The only thing I'd add is McDonald's at its essence, this is a growth business. And so we're not accepting negative comps as just sort of the way it is because of the consumer headwinds. We absolutely are committed to getting this business back to growth foundation of that is the value platforms that we've talked about, but we need to do more on menu innovation. We've got more levers that we can do on digital and certainly getting our marketing to be more of a contributor as it was last year. I think all of those things need to work in combination to get the business back to where we know its rightful place is.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning. Chris, you said in your prepared remarks that your value leadership gap versus the competition has shrunk. And I'm just curious how are you measuring this gap what informs you that it has shrunk. And just secondly, what gives you the confidence you can reignite this gap with value at a time when everyone seems to be getting much more aggressive on value? Is it the success you're seeing with the $5 deal or what else is feeling the confidence that this gap can reignite?\nChris Kempczinski: Sure. Thanks for the question. So there's two ways that we measure value. They're both consumer-based surveys. But one is we get to just the overall brand impression and we survey consumers around the world for their brand impression of how McDonald's does on both value and affordability. Affordability being a more specific thing around typically price points, value being a broader metric that speaks to a number of different things. So it's all survey-based. Like I said, there's part of it, which is looking at brand image. And then we also have a second survey that we do around most recent experience and that gives us a little bit more of a current snapshot of where we are seeing the consumer. And it's been particularly on the most recent visit that we're seeing our leadership gap is shrinking. Our brand image scores around value and affordability. We still are very strong there and we're seeing those gaps hold up. But on the more recent visit that we are seeing some of the pressure, some of the decrease, still leading, but that margin may be shrinking a couple of points in a market, for example. In terms of what gives us confidence about our ability to continue to lead on value, it starts with the fact that for 70 years, we've led on value. And for 70 years, we've led on value because it's what the brand stands for. And frankly, we can buy food and paper at a better price than anybody else. So we have an underlying competitive advantage that we can buy at a lower price than anybody else in our industry. The other thing is the way that the consumer defines value, yes, there's a price point component to it. But the other thing that we see in all of our value work is that there are intangibles that consumers think about around how they define good value or not. Things like, for example, how convenient is the restaurant, things like, for example, how clean the restaurant is, things like how tasty is the food. Those typically are representing maybe 25% to 30% of consumers' value perceptions. So it's not just about hitting low price points. It's also the overall experience you can deliver. And as you've heard us talk about in the past, our restaurant estate is in great shape. Our restaurants are running strong execution, service times are improving around the world. CSAT scores are high. So I think we've got a lot of things from the intangibles that are working in our favor. And as you've heard us talk about on this call, there's other things that we're doing to make sure from a value standpoint and particularly around value platforms and products and price points that where the consumer expects us to be.\nIan Borden: Brian, I might just do two little hooks on Chris' just on that second bit about why we can win. I mean I just I wouldn't underestimate the power of the equity we have in some of our menu items that when we get those items priced at the right price point in the current context for consumers, I think that's unique to us the scale and level of marketing dollars we have available as a system that we can direct to support these platforms that we get -- as we get them in place is unmatched. And then I'll just double-click on what Chris touched on the experience. I mean we've talked the last couple of quarters. I think Joe would talk to the fact that our customer satisfaction scores in the US are at kind of an all-time high for this point in the year. We're seeing that pretty consistently around the world. We're getting faster, we're delivering a better experience. And when you put all that together, that's what kind of defines value for the consumer. And we certainly are adamant and relentless that we're going to get that right in each and every market to be in a winning position.\nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Jake Bartlett with Truist.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was just really a clarification on your commentary about recent trends. And that's the US. And I think, overall, you said that the third quarter is starting as the second quarter ended I just want to make sure that, that's true for the US. And I guess if that's true, and it would, I think, implies below what was reported for the second quarter. If that's true in the commentary that the $5 meal is doing what you hoped, how does that match? It seems like the $5 meal you're happy with, but it doesn't seem to have really driven an improvement. Just want to make sure I understand the commentary there on recent trends and what's driving it.\nChris Kempczinski: That's right, Jake. So we obviously exited the second quarter as we lapped the Grimace Birthday Meal and Shake with negative comps. And then we have experienced negative comps here in July. The success, obviously, we've seen is the shift in traffic that we're experiencing. And in my 22 years of experience at McDonald's, traffic and guest counts usually comes before sales and so we've got some exciting promotions up coming here in the second half of the year. And we think that if we can get the traffic moving, we'll see customers obviously willing to spend more. Remember that the customer that's coming in for the $5 meal deal, they are buying more than just the $5 meal deal because we see that average check-up around a little over $10. So that's why we feel strongly about how the $5 meal deal is connecting in the marketplace and specifically with that low end consumer, which has been our opportunity.\nMike Cieplak: We have time for one more question with Jon Tower at Citi.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a similar line of thinking in terms of your expectations for store margins for the balance of the year. Obviously, you've got some good guys with respect to inflation coming off, but I think pricing is also rolling off a little bit, and now it seems like promotional activity is going to be ramping. So how should we anticipate the impact on store margins both in the US business and the IOM segment for the balance of '24 and perhaps into early '25?\nIan Borden: Hi, John, it's Ian. Let me try and get that one. Well, look, I think as you would have seen through the first half, even with more muted top line growth. Restaurant margins have held up pretty well. Obviously, as you noted, we will take or certainly expect to take less pricing through the year, just obviously managing through the current context we're in. We still got a fair bit of carryover pricing from 2023. So that certainly helps a little bit. And as I talked about earlier, certainly, inflation on food and paper and other cost items outside of wages has come down substantially from where it's been over the last couple of years. So that's helpful. The US, obviously, as I talked about, we've got the wage pressures, particularly from California. So that's certainly a headwind that we're working through. And I think overall, if you think about the year, I think we certainly expect, if I use company-operated margins as a proxy for those to be down a little bit from where we ended in 2023. But I think pretty good in terms of when you consider the overall context of what we're working through this year.\nMike Cieplak: Okay. That concludes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. Thank you, Joe. Thanks, everyone for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "MCD", "quarter": 1, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-04-30 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's First Quarter 2024 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin. \nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. \n As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. \n Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. \n And now I'll turn it over to Chris. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I join you today inspired from our recent worldwide convention, a time when McDonald's comes together to celebrate the success of our system, the relevance of our brand, power of our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the collective strength of our system were on full display as we welcomed our global McDonald's franchisees, restaurant teams, suppliers and company employees to Barcelona. \n For the first time in our nearly 70-year history, we held this biennial reunion outside of North America, a testament to the global power of our brand. And we're joined by more than 15,000 attendees from nearly 100 market to discuss how we're reimagining the future across our three-legged stool. \n It's clear that McDonald's continues to operate from a position of strength across nearly all areas of the business as we focus on executing the day-to-day at a high level and establishing strong platforms for long-term sustained growth. \n The first quarter of 2024 marks our 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last 4 years. This success was built by establishing a strong foundation with our strategic plan based on consumer insights and focused on creating relevant marketing campaigns with our brand connected to culture. \n At the same time, we're maximizing the strength of our core menu equities and building an industry-leading loyalty base. Combined with our modernized restaurant estate, strong franchisee alignment, engaged restaurant employees and strong restaurant level unit economics, McDonald's is well positioned. This winning formula continues to drive results and our customers visiting our restaurants today can easily see our commitment to providing them with a great experience, evident through our strong customer satisfaction scores. \n As I reflect on the first quarter of the year, it is clear that broad-based consumer pressures persist around the world. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the QSR industry. \n It's worth noting that in Q1, industry traffic was flat to declining in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the U.K. And across almost all major markets, industry traffic is slowing. In the context of a difficult macro environment for the industry, we know our customers are looking for reliable everyday value now more than ever. That has always been our promise: to deliver delicious feel-good moments at an affordable price each and every day. \n Staying on the side of the consumer and executing against our plan is our model for driving long-term growth regardless of the broader landscape. This was the case nearly 70 years ago when Ray Kroc opened the very first McDonald's, and this remains just as true to this day. \n As consumer pressures have mounted, we've reacted with agility to proactively meet evolving customer needs. For example, over the past year, we've launched everyday value menus across many of our international markets, including all 5 of our big IOM markets. Featuring value bundles at various price points, these new offerings provide smaller, more affordable meals to our customers. \n In Germany, our McSmart menu has continued its strong performance with record units sold during the first quarter. And in other markets like Spain, our everyday value menu features a convenient bundle for every price point, which continues to drive results. \n I recently spent time with our market team in Poland and experienced firsthand their renewed focus on value in an environment where significant inflation has created challenging consumer dynamics. In light of these challenges, I was impressed by the market's ability to quickly identify an opportunity in their everyday value offerings to implement a new entry-level value platform, which is driving traffic back into our restaurants. \n And in France, a market which I flagged last quarter, I've been impressed by the speed with which our team and franchisees have moved to address their opportunities. The market now has established their own McSmart value menu with high consumer awareness, which is driving encouraging progress in their business trends. \n It's clear that McDonald's offers delicious food at a great value, and customers continue to tell us this through our survey work. That said, we must be laser-focused on affordability, which means good entry-level price points available every day. In the markets where we're doing this well, the business is outperforming. In some markets, however, it's clear we still have opportunities to strengthen our proposition. \n As we continue to take a One McDonald's approach to solving problems, the unique size and scale of the McDonald's system gives us the ability to learn from each other. And it's examples like our success with the McSmart value menu construct that we will look to replicate further. McDonald's has a long history of being the go-to destination for value and it's imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers. We literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry. \n As we've done for the last 70 years, our teams in those markets are working closely with our local franchisees to balance menu pricing decisions with the right affordability strategy in place, and where needed, get more aggressive with our value offerings. \n Despite the elevated cost environment we've navigated over the past couple of years, average franchising cash flow and the corresponding margins remained strong. And thanks to the financial strength of our restaurant P&Ls, we have the ability to invest in these traffic-driving initiatives. \n Despite these ongoing challenges and pressured consumer spending across our segments, we delivered global comparable sales growth of nearly 2% in the first quarter. And we continue to raise the bar on the customer experience in our restaurants with a focus on strong execution. This is driving improved service times and higher levels of customer satisfaction across our markets. \n In challenging times, there is significant power in focusing on what's within our control to maximize the impact of our strategic plan: offering our customers delicious food at unparalleled value and convenience. And it's exactly this approach that will continue to drive growth. McDonald's is best positioned to win in the industry because when we combine our strong system alignment with our fully modernized estate, a globally recognized brand, delicious food on our core menu and the highest level of execution across our 4Ds, no competitor could match us. \n As consumer spending remains pressured and macro headwinds continue, we are laser-focused on maintaining our competitive advantages and growing QSR market share. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Ian to talk more about our Q1 results. \nIan Borden: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned just a few minutes ago, strong execution against our strategic plan delivered global comp sales of nearly 2% for the first quarter, driven by growth across our U.S. and IOM segments. As we've said before, as customers continue to be more intentional with the dollars that they spend in a pressured economic landscape, we expect moderated top line growth this year. \n In our IDL segment, positive comp sales in Japan, Europe and Latin America were offset by the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East. We remain proud of the way our system continues to show up for customers every day, and we continue to work closely with our DL partners to support local communities in the region. \n It's during times like this that I'm once again reminded of the resilience of the entire McDonald's system and our ability to deliver delicious, feel-good moments to our customers in any environment, which I've seen time and again in my 30 years with McDonald's. \n We continue to drive a One McDonald's Way approach to our creative excellence this quarter, combining local cultural relevance with global reach to engage a new generation of McDonald's fans. In more than 30 markets around the world, including the U.S., we tapped into a new global community with a truly unique brand campaign. \n While McDonald's has long been an enduring brand across communities, in anime, we're known as WcDonald's, a fictional restaurant we brought to life for our fans this quarter. By featuring our Chicken McNuggets, alongside a new dipping sauce, theme packaging and bonus gaming content with a mobile app purchase, we created brand excitement and lifted McNugget category sales. Our fans' passion for the McDonald's brand and for the WcDonald's universe quickly spread across social media in the U.S. with over 6 billion impressions and nearly 100,000 mentions. \n Our delicious burgers were also featured across many markets this quarter as we continued to showcase our strength in beef with a consistent approach to improving our fan favorites. Now deployed in over 80% of our restaurants globally, Best Burger was recently introduced in France this quarter, delivering hotter and juicier burgers. Early results were promising with lifts across our core burger categories and improved customer satisfaction in both our taste and quality scores. \n And in the U.S., where we're now fully deployed across the country, we celebrated the national launch of Best Burger with an iconic character at the center of our advertising. Tapping into the nostalgia of the Hamburglar, the campaign drove a significant lift in the Big Mac category and contributed to record customer satisfaction scores in the market. \n The progress we've made with our core burgers highlights what McDonald's can achieve when we tap into the full power of our system, size and scale. We'll continue to showcase that small changes can add up to deliver big improvements to both taste and quality by scaling Best Burger to nearly all restaurants by the end of 2026. \n And as we look to further build on our leadership in beef, our team of chefs from around the world have created a larger satiating burger. We'll be testing this burger in a few markets later this year ensuring that it has universal appeal before scaling it across the globe. \n We also celebrated our menu in the mobile app this quarter, combining the strength of our core equities with new and exciting digital experiences for our customers. Across our top markets, digital penetration is growing as evidenced by our increased loyalty sales and record mobile app orders, leading to greater frequency and increased spend by loyalty customers. \n We're also growing digital share as we leverage learnings from across markets in areas like gamification. Australia featured McDonald's World Famous Fries at the center of a digital campaign and offered customers a chance to win by digitally redeeming their game pieces. Powered by a seamless digital experience, the campaign resulted in incremental customer acquisition and increased the market's loyalty sales. \n The U.K. market also drove strong loyalty results with the return of their Winning Sips digital experience, encouraging customers to add a drink to their order with a chance to win on every cup. Customer engagement in the mobile app increased with digitally redeemed game pieces, and we drove record growth in 90-day active users in the market. Because of unique digital experiences like Winning Sips, our loyalty members continue to engage more frequently with nearly 75% of our total loyalty user base in the U.K. active during the last quarter. \n We know the experience we provide, whether through our mobile app or in our restaurants, is a significant driver of how often our customers choose to visit McDonald's. But providing our delicious food at the right price is equally critical, especially in today's environment, where consumers all over the world are paying more for everyday goods and services. As Chris mentioned a few minutes ago, a strong value proposition continued to drive results within several of our markets this quarter. \n This consumer-centric approach to providing our customers with compelling value at affordable price points continued to drive strong results in markets like Germany, Spain and Poland and led to QSR market share gains. As we remain agile to meet the needs of our customers around the world, we'll continue to use our size and scale for the greatest impact, sharing what is working to drive consistency and enable speed. \n Turning to the P&L. Our global top line growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of about 2% in constant currencies. \n Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was nearly 45%. \n Despite the pressured consumer spending environment we've discussed this morning, top line results generated nearly $3.5 billion of restaurant margin for the quarter, an increase of about 4% in constant currency. This was partially offset by higher G&A costs as we continue to invest in our strategic transformation efforts and growth opportunities such as digital, as well as costs associated with our biennial Worldwide Convention that Chris mentioned. \n Our adjusted effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter. \n As we've talked about before, driving long-term growth requires making the right strategic and forward-looking investments. The resilience of our business and our overall financial strength put us in the ideal position to invest in critical areas that deliver against customer needs as well as unlock efficiencies for our people and our business. This includes new restaurant development as we look to accelerate the pace of openings and grow our footprint to 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027. Development for the year is off to a strong start across markets, including in China, where we recently opened our 6,000th restaurant, and we are pacing on track against our global plan. \n In addition to restaurant development, we're also investing for long-term growth in areas like digital and technology as well as our transformation efforts within our Global Business Services organization. By leveraging the full strength of our global scale, we'll build new and modern capabilities and ultimately unlock speed and innovation for our entire McDonald's system. \n Despite the headwinds that persist, we remain well positioned with the unique strength and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide. As Chris talked about upfront, we are focused on how we can further leverage this across our consumer, restaurant and company platforms. With our system aligned on the right strategies moving forward, along with the financial strength of our franchisees, suppliers and the company, I remain confident that we will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and for our shareholders. \n And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. We like to say that when culture calls, McDonald's answers. With a brand that is renowned throughout the world and marketing that is resonating in culture and with consumers, it's no wonder that we've been recognized yet again as one of the World's Most Effective Marketers by Work in association with Cannes Lion. We're elevating our creative excellence, scaling great ideas globally and building meaningful relationships with the next generation of consumers. \n Breakthrough campaigns, a great-tasting menu and personalized experiences will drive customers to McDonald's again and again as they come through the physical doors of our restaurants and the digital door of our mobile app. And in this environment with pressured QSR traffic, we have an opportunity to get the customers who already visit to visit more often. As more customers make purchase decisions based on personalized recommendations on their phones, driving frequency means using our digital capabilities like loyalty to know and serve our customers better than anyone else. With the insights powered by our loyalty members, we will work to deliver the right message at the right time to the right consumer, encouraging those who already love McDonald's to visit even more. And when we shift marketing investment from traditional mass media like television, print and billboard ads to collective investment in modern and digital capabilities to personalize the experience, we drive profitability. \n And successfully delivering personalized experiences depends on transforming our restaurants to deliver what customers want: hot fresh orders delivered with convenience and accuracy. The future restaurant experience is already underway in markets across the world, whether it's Ready on Arrival, a dedicated drive-thru lane for digital orders in China or other flexible format concepts. And by building the technology infrastructure to support the 3 long-term platforms we've discussed, we will create a more reliable experience and operate more efficiently. \n We've talked about the ways best-in-class marketing and our iconic menu fuel the brand, but there is another component. Each and every day, our McDonald's system strives to fulfill our purpose of feeding and fostering communities locally. And there's no greater example of our decades-long dedication to driving positive impact than our work with Ronald McDonald House Charities. \n This year, we're celebrating the 50th anniversary of Ronald McDonald House Charities, providing essential services that remove barriers to health care, strengthen families and promote healing when children need it most. Since that first house opening, the charity's global footprint has expanded significantly and they've helped tens of millions of families through the hardest of times. With more than 385 programs running across the world, the organization is providing support for families across 90% of the world's leading pediatric hospitals and extending care through more than 2 million overnight family stays each year. \n Before I close, I'd also like to take a moment to recognize Rick Hernandez for his many contributions to the McDonald's system throughout his 28 years of service on our Board of Directors. And as I assume the additional role of Chairman following our Annual Shareholders Meeting next month, I look forward to working alongside our new Lead Independent Director, Miles White, and the rest of the entire Board to continue to deliver strong performance united under an aligned company voice. \n I am confident that the system is focused on the right priorities with Accelerating the Arches as our playbook, evolving to meet the customer needs of tomorrow and laying the foundation for future growth. \n With that, we'll take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \nMike Cieplak: Our first question is from David Tarantino with Baird. \nDavid Tarantino: My question is on the comps outlook. I think, Ian, you mentioned on the last call that you had expected comps in the U.S. and IOM to settle to the 3% to 4% range this year. And now I think your commentary suggests you're operating in a tougher climate than when you gave that guidance. \n So one, I wanted to ask if that range is still in play in both of those markets in your view? And then secondly, for the U.S. specifically, do you think a more concerted or more aggressive value approach is needed to get there in the current environment. \nIan Borden: Thanks for the question. Let me start and then I think Chris will probably jump in to kind of build out on whatever I say. But look, what I would start with is, as you know well, we don't typically give comp guidance. I think what we were trying to do as we looked back was to provide a directional perspective on what we felt the industry kind of historical range looked like in more typical years. As you know, we talked about '24 being a year where we felt top line was going to moderate. \n I think -- four months into the year, I think what we can say is, clearly, 2024 isn't going to be a typical year for the broader industry. I say that because we're certainly seeing, as you heard in our upfront remarks, that the macro headwinds have been more significant than I think we even anticipated coming into the year and we continue to see those macro headwinds as we have started quarter 2. \n And frankly, many of our large international markets and the U.S. -- and I think we expect in the U.S. that we're going to start the quarter roughly flat from a comp sales perspective from what we can see so far. And so I think what we're seeing is in many of our largest markets internationally and the U.S. that the industry traffic is either flat or we're certainly seeing declining trends. And I think as a result of that, we believe we're going to likely probably be below that historical range that we had indicated. \n I think what's important is, clearly, we don't control the macro context around us. And so what we're focused on is always is listening to the needs of consumers, making sure we're making the appropriate adjustments in our business to deliver against those needs, and of course, is always ensuring that we can do it better than anyone else. \n And I think affordability is clearly an area where consumer expectations are heightened. I mean, I think consumers are obviously dealing with a lot in the current macro context. Obviously, they're getting hit, I think, across their full basket of goods and services by all the inflationary impacts. \n I think, importantly, we've got a really long and strong history of being a leader in both value for money and affordability. We've obviously been through these difficult context many times over time. I say that because I think it's important that we know what we need to do. I think we know how to do it well, and the financial strength of our business puts us in a position to be able to do that better than anyone else. And I think that's what we're going to make sure we're delivering against that, and each of our large markets is positioned for success against those current consumer expectations. \nChristopher Kempczinski: And then turning to value in the U.S., I think it's important to first recognize that there is some great value that our system, our franchisees are offering in the U.S. 90% of our system in the U.S. is offering meal bundles for $4 or less. And if you look at digital value, we've got some great digital offers out there. I just opened my app while I was waiting to jump on this answer and we're offering right now a Big Mac for $0.29 when you buy a Big Mac or you could get 30% off McCrispy. So there's a lot of great value out there. \n But I think the issue that we have in the U.S. is in an environment where everybody is out there with a value message, there's an opportunity for us to drive better awareness of what our value platform is. And one of the things that's going on in the U.S. right now is the value message that I was talking about, we're doing it in 50 different ways with local value. And what we don't have in the U.S. right now is a national value platform at the same time that our competitors are out there with a national value platform. \n So the opportunity for us in the U.S., I think, is to get more aligned to the system around a strong national value proposition that we can then use our media scale to drive high consumer awareness on it. So that's what I know Joe and the team are focused on the U.S. And as I look at the U.S. compared to other markets where we're having success, you've got to be able to have high awareness and that's, I think, the big opportunity for us going forward in the U.S. business. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Harbour: Yes. I guess, given kind of the response to that prior question, what's some of the timing on that value plan, especially in the U.S.? Do you think that we'll start to see some improvement in the second quarter? Do you think it sort of takes longer than that? What else could we think about from a sales driving perspective or maybe a product perspective that will be noticeable U.S. comp drivers as we think about this year? \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. Well, I think what we've seen, if I turn to France, as an example, France, I was talking about last quarter as having a number of areas of opportunity and in my prepared remarks, I noted that, that system in France came together very quickly around a national value program that they then put significant marketing support against and they got to north of 80% awareness in a very short period of time that's starting to drive encouraging trends in their business results. \n I think what that highlights is it's not about how quickly can you see the business impact when you have a strong marketing support against a compelling value platform, it's how quickly can your system move and pivot to getting that in place. And I know that, that's something that Joe and the U.S. team are talking with U.S. franchisees on. I think, again, there's lots of great value that we have out there at a local level, but it's how do we come together in the U.S. around a stronger national value platform that can compete. How long that takes, I think, is going to be up to individual conversations that happen in the market. But it's clear that once you have that in place, the business could start to respond pretty quickly. \nIan Borden: And maybe just the only build I'd add to what Chris said, Brian, is, I mean, I think I know, as Chris said, our U.S. leadership team is really -- is working really closely with our owner/operators. I think we have a good understanding of what we need to do, kind of how to do that well. And we're going to move, obviously, as quickly as we can together with owner/operators to kind of address that opportunity. And we've seen that work really well in other markets globally, as Chris was talking about. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. \nDennis Geiger: Wondering if you could speak a little bit more to kind of what you're seeing with that U.S. consumer, whether it's by income cohort or spending pattern. \n And then sort of beyond the affordability and aligning the system on a national value plan, can you speak at all to sort of some of the other key levers that maybe can be supportive of U.S. sales growth in the current environment? \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. Well, I think one of the things that we noted when in our opening is that the consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar. And the inflation that has occurred over the last couple of years in the U.S., I think, has certainly created that environment. \n And while it may feel it may be more pronounced with the lower-income consumer, I think it's important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value. And so our focus is on making sure, as I said, that we're offering strong value to our customers. And that's going to have benefits not just to low income, that will have benefits to middle and upper income as well. And so the actions that you take are the same regardless of the income cohort that you're talking about. \n From other sales driver standpoint, on that score, I feel really good about where we're at in the U.S. As I look at, most importantly, how we're running our restaurants, our franchisees in partnership with our U.S. team are doing a really nice job of running strong restaurant operations. We're seeing improvements in speed of service. We're seeing the turnover in our restaurants is down. \n All of those things in combination are improving customer satisfaction. We're seeing our satisfaction scores increase in the U.S. And then we will, of course, have menu innovation that happens throughout the year. It's part of what we do. I'm not going to get into detailing exactly what the menu innovation is going to be and when it comes, but certainly you can expect that we will use menu innovation as well to find ways to engage our customers. \n And lastly, I would just point out, we always have to be finding ways to be driving consumer interest around great marketing plans. And if we're doing great marketing, you can grow the business just with your core menu. And so I know the U.S. team, along with our agency in the U.S., Wieden+Kennedy, they're continuing to look for what's the next big idea that we have from a marketing standpoint to drive the business. So multiple levers at our disposal. \nIan Borden: And Dennis, maybe I'll just build on what Chris was saying because I think it's such an important point. I mean our -- the foundation of our business, the vast majority of our business is in an incredibly strong position. I mean, I think we come into this more challenged macro environment kind of in an advantaged position. And I think the emphasis with that would be we have a fully modernized estate, as Chris kind of referred to. We've got, I think, a marketing and brand engine that's best-in-class meaning I think the team continues to deliver great creative execution. I think that's resonating with customers in culturally relevant ways. We've got our system financial strength that's at one of its strongest points in our history. So we've got the ability to kind of lean into opportunities together because of all the work we've done over the last couple of years. \n And then if you think of our 3Ds of delivery, drive-thru and digital, we have a leadership position in each of those areas. We're continuing to invest to drive growth in those areas. Delivery, for example, the U.S. business kind of hit all-time highs in the first quarter. Delivery is -- sorry, digital, as you know, we've made a lot of progress in. And we know we continue to drive growth in digital more broadly. \n So I think we feel really good about the vast majority of our business. We just know the consumer is looking for more on affordability and value, and we're going to lean in and make sure we can meet those needs. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. \nJohn Ivankoe: I was wondering what kind of opportunity or maybe need that we have to address core menu pricing in the U.S.? And I speak specifically about things like Quarter Pounder combo pricing or Big Mac combo pricing that can actually be very different across the restaurant base even within a given market. And obviously, the press will communicate some of the highest pricing in certain stores as you talk about what the direction of pricing has happened to McDonald's across the country even if it is just certain stores. \n So is there a need or an opportunity to kind of get back and communicate around core menu pricing to kind of give the perception of value for consumers that maybe even or outside of the value menus of what we did pre-COVID? \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. Well, let me start with -- I think it's important to recognize that if you look at margins in the U.S. today, restaurant-level margins for franchisees versus where we were in 2019, we've just now rebuilt franchise restaurant-level margins back to where we were in 2019. So the pricing that's been taken over the last several years was all taken as a means to offset what we were seeing around quite high labor inflation and quite high commodity -- food and paper inflation. \n So restaurant margins are now back to where we are -- where we were again in 2019 in the U.S., which then says to me that we do have the ability to be thinking about what we do from a value proposition going forward, and I talked about that in my answer to the earlier question. \n I think the idea of where do we need to stay from a pricing standpoint on core menu, we've done a lot over the last several years building our pricing capabilities and the pricing capabilities that we have happen at the local level. So we will go and we will take a look at what are the competitive products around us, what are they priced at and how do our products match up against that. And all of that is then used to inform at the franchisee level, at the restaurant level what our relative pricing is. \n So I think from where we are, I feel like we are in a decent shape from an overall menu standpoint. Yes, there will be the one-offs that gets sensationalized and reported on. But again, our opportunity is we need to speak in a more compelling way with one voice about what are those entry point, affordable price points that will be attractive to consumers and that's what the focus for our U.S. team, I know is. \nIan Borden: Maybe John, I'll just build a little bit on what Chris talked to because I think -- maybe the way to think about it is what do we think good looks like in getting value and affordability right. And I would -- I think we would say it's a couple of things. It's making sure, as Chris said, we've got those entry-level items at affordable price points for people -- or for consumers. It's making sure that we've got an entry-level meal bundle that's at an affordable -- compelling affordable price point and doing that generally with products that consumers know and that we've got strong equity behind. And then I think if breakfast is a big part of our business like it certainly is in the U.S., making sure we've got compelling value at breakfast as well. \n And I think, obviously, from an executional standpoint, we've got to make sure we've got the right products at the right price, and we've got, as you've heard Chris talk about, that consumer awareness at a level of significance so that consumers are aware of the offers and the affordability price points and that's going to influence their visits as we look forward and they're looking across different options. \n So again, I think we're working hard to make sure we're delivering against each of those opportunities. And as Chris talked about, in markets where we've done that well, we're seeing really strong performance and that's the opportunity we're focused on making sure we have in place in each of our top markets. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore. \nDavid Palmer: You noted that customer satisfaction scores had been heading higher. And that definitely doesn't surprise me given all the improvements to the restaurants and digital and the core food renovations. But it does -- I guess what does surprise me is that the gap to the industry, at least in the U.S., has eroded that out-performance gap. I wonder whether it's the surveys or certain consumer trends as you slice it thin, even dayparts. \n What are the insights about why that gap has narrowed because it has been surprising. Is it just an entry price point opportunity in the value scores that you're seeing with certain income cohorts? And how does the opportunity for the U.S. differ from maybe some of your other international Big 5 markets? \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. I think on our overall satisfaction, again, we look and we're seeing improvement across all of our major markets on satisfaction, and as you noted, there's multiple aspects to that. \n I think where we see the one opportunity as you sort of then decompose drivers of satisfaction, certainly, in some markets we have seen that our relative superiority on affordability has declined. And I think if there's any pressure on overall satisfaction or if there's anything that's closing it, it's probably losing some of that relative superiority on affordability. Again, that's not in all markets, but that's in a few markets. \n It's important to still note we still are viewed as a superior value proposition, but the degree of gap in a few markets has narrowed. And so that leads back to all the things that we've been talking about on this call as things that we need to be focused on. \nIan Borden: David, just maybe to build because I think experience, as you noted, is encompassing of a number of different factors. I mean, I think we're driving better speed of execution consistently across our top markets. We know when we put capabilities in place, as you've heard us talk about previously like Ready on Arrival, which is in place in the U.S. that we're delivering hotter, fresher food as customers arrive to our restaurants and delivering an overall better experience. I think the sharp point and Chris mentioned this is just we've got that opportunity on affordability and we're really laser-focused on making sure we can meet the need that consumers are expressing in the current context. But we feel really good about all the other aspects of the experience and how we're delivering against what customers are expecting. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. \nEric Gonzalez: On the pricing discussion, and I appreciate the point that your store-level margins are back to 2019 levels, but perhaps you could speak to the current level of year-over-year pricing and your current inflation expectations for food and labor this year? \n And then just maybe whether you've seen any changes in the flow-through of that pricing or any elasticity changes. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. Well, my guess is your question is focused on the U.S. because obviously I could give a different answer depending on where you are in the world. But if I focus just on the U.S., most of the pricing that you see now in the U.S. is carryover pricing. It's not new pricing per se. Most of it again is carryover pricing. \n That said, we do continue to see there's certainly labor inflation. Much of that is coming out of what happened in California. And on a national level, you could probably see we're expecting high single-digit labor inflation. Again, much of that from the bleed over of what California introduced. \n And then on food and paper inflation, I think that's gone down to much more historical levels. So we're back at more historical levels on what we see from a food and paper inflation going forward. \nIan Borden: Maybe just to build, Eric, to what Chris said, I mean, the food and paper low single digits. So I think we have seen kind of favorable movement in this year, although we've still got a fair bit of carryover effect from '23 inflation, certainly into the first part of '24 from both food and paper and labor. \n I think what's important to note on pricing is, I think, our business, including our owner/operators, understand that the consumer is price-weary. And I think we certainly are going to be prudent and thoughtful about any further price increases that we're looking at for the rest of 2024 on that backdrop and keep working on the opportunity that we've talked about a fair bit already on the affordability and getting that in place to kind of address the consumer need. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. \nSara Senatore: I guess one clarification and then a question. You mentioned that the QSR industry traffic is flat to declining. I guess, I always think of this as an industry where traffic is kind of, at best, flat. So I'm just trying to understand, given you usually have better data than I do, whether that's an inflection point? Or this -- the sort of traffic trends have been more consistent, which it sort of sounds like? \n And then the question I have is you mentioned margins are right back to where they are. I think franchisee cash flow is also back to pre-COVID, not COVID peaks. But I guess as you think about maybe investing in value, do you contemplate you doing anything to support franchisees. I don't know if it's sort of fee abatements like digital fees or we've seen some other restaurants kind of pull back on those when franchisees are making investments, whether they be capital investments or in other operating expenses. So just is supporting franchisees something that you can do if you really need to reinvest in value? \nIan Borden: It's Ian. Let me take the clarification and then I'll let Chris address your question. So what I said earlier was that industry traffic, and I was talking about across many of our top markets, is flat or we're seeing declining trends. \n If I talk specifically about the U.S. in quarter 1, industry comparable traffic was negative and we expect it to be negative for the full year. And I think that's the context that's important, just to give the context to the more challenging macro environment. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Yes. And then turning to franchisee and your question about how we support franchisees, you're right that our U.S. franchisees, and I could go through other markets as well, but they're in a strong position. When you look at franchisee cash flow, we are at, I think, our second highest level ever, 2021 being the peak, but we're at very strong franchising cash flows. We're going to see franchisee cash flows increase in Q1. \n And if you think about the balance sheet for our franchisees, the modernization that we did on our restaurants in the U.S. many years ago now was all done in a period of super low interest rates. And so any debt that's being carried on the books for our franchisees is at significantly lower interest rates than what we're seeing in the market right now. And so our franchisees are in a strong position. \n As you know, they control pricing. We don't step in and subsidize pricing. But I think the opportunity here is what I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of great value out there in the market. We're just doing it in a very fragmented way. And so the opportunity for us is how do you maybe pull back a little bit on all the local value that we're offering, which, frankly, we don't have very high awareness on and how do you coalesce and drive awareness around a national value proposition. \n So I think there's a smart way to do this that can end up being net neutral to a franchisee P&L. But just using the size and scale of our marketing engine and the amount of media that we spend, I think that's going to be the opportunity for us going forward. And certainly, we're in a good position from a system financial health standpoint to go do that. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. \nLauren Silberman: I had a follow-up on the value question. You mentioned you're offering value 50 different ways. Can you just talk about what a future national value platform could look like given how different the cost environment looks like across the U.S.? I imagine price point value could be difficult. \n And then when you look at what type of value consumers are most looking for, is it price point, lower entry points, bundled deals? Are you seeing an uptick in the value mix? \nChristopher Kempczinski: Yes. I'll maybe start and then I'll hand off to Ian. But I think Ian outlined in general a construct that we see as sort of being our successful playbook, which is you need to have good entry level price points. You need to have a meal deal. And then there needs to be something that if you have a big breakfast business, you need to be offering value that's specific to breakfast. \n And in a number of markets around the world, we're doing that very successfully. Certainly, in the U.S., we see that there is different cost environment. But then, again, our competitors have those same differences between high-cost markets, low-cost markets, et cetera. And so -- and that exists in other markets as well. If you were to go to France, it's much different if you were to go to Paris than what it would be somewhere outside of Paris. \n So those differences exist in many markets around the world. I think what our system has historically shown an ability to do is working with our franchisees, how do you think about it from a portfolio standpoint. And ultimately, in this business, if you're driving transactions, if you're driving guest counts, that ends up being a good thing for everybody. \n So we have a history of being able to do this. We've done this as I mentioned in our opening. We've been doing this for 70 some-odd years. So I think we understand what it takes, but it happens through a conversation with our franchisees to get aligned around what that national value proposition looks like. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Bittner: As it relates to the operating margin guidance, mid- to high 40s range is still a very wide range, Ian, and I fully understand there's a lot of moving pieces in the financial model. But I'm curious, with a quarter in the books, if there's an opportunity to perhaps tighten the expectations around that range? As we look towards last year's 47%, is that kind of a good base case target for operating margins this year? Or should we anticipate declines similar to like what we saw in the first quarter? \nIan Borden: Brian, thanks for the question. Look, I mean, you hit on it. It's obviously in the context we're working through in '24. There are a lot of variables at play. And I think the macro context means it's difficult for us to kind of predict the forward look in terms of what's the duration of the macro headwinds we're seeing and the depth. So I think that obviously is impacting performance. And as always, our op margin leverage is going to be dependent on our strength and level of sales growth. \n Look, I think I remain really confident in our ability to drive leverage in op margin over time as we're able to kind of continue to drive strong top line growth. And I think we're confident, as we work to kind of address the affordability opportunities we've got, that's going to be helpful in getting sales growth back to the direction we want. And over time, that will certainly be helpful in continuing to drive leverage and op margin. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. \nAndrew Charles: Chris, looking to learn more about how this national value platform will be different from years past. So if I think, historically, back in 2018, for instance, the $1 $2 $3 was launched. It looked like it was a negative traffic year for the U.S. business just in that regional approach to value had been more successful the brand despite what you said about competitors that are pursuing more national value. So I'm curious what you think is going to make this time different that will lead national value to be more successful, if you can put about the constructs of what that will look like going forward. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. Well, state the obvious. It's up to the U.S. team in partnership with our owner/operators to define what is a national value proposition look like in the U.S. As you know, with $1 $2 $3, it took a minute for that program to gain traction, but it then drove very strong results. I think, certainly, if you look at the U.S. performance over the last many years under the $1 $2 $3, I think we're now -- we were in year 6 or 7 of the $1 $2 $3, that was a very successful platform for us in driving performance across the U.S. business. \n The point about how quickly does it actually impact transactions and turn that around, it goes back to how quickly you can drive awareness with the consumer on that. And the faster that you can drive awareness, the faster you can start to see that driving incrementality on the business. \n So I think, first, it's getting the platform defined, making sure that it's compelling with customers. And then making sure that you support it properly to drive the awareness that you need to ultimately impact transactions on the business. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Guggenheim. \nGregory Francfort: My question is just on the International business. And I'm curious what you're seeing, I don't know if it's maybe from a protest standpoint or if the business has continued to weaken there into the second quarter in the same way that it's done in the U.S. business and what you might be doing from a support perspective through the ideal royalty rate or anything like that? \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. I think if you look at the impact of some of the boycotts in a few of our markets, I wouldn't say things are getting any worse there. And then, I think, in some cases you might be able to look and say perhaps it's getting slightly better in some places. \n So no big change on that. I think it's also just worth -- it's interesting to note that in many of those markets, our delivery business is holding up quite well, which is kind of an interesting dynamic there. \n So maybe marginally better in some markets. But as I referenced on an earlier call, we're not expecting to see any meaningful improvement in the impacts on that until the war is over, and we continue to have that outlook on what the Middle East conflict is going to do to our trends. Ian, I'll pass it over to you. \nIan Borden: Yes. Maybe just one kind of build on the headwinds. I mean, I think what I said upfront, that the macro headwinds that we were seeing were more significant across a number of our large international markets and that's continued into the start of quarter 2. \n I think on support for kind of the IDL, look, I mean, you've heard me talk about this before. I mean, I think when there are external factors that are kind of beyond the control of our franchisees that are impacting the business and those franchisees are doing everything right and continue to do everything right for the McDonald's business, providing support in situations that warrant it, is kind of part of what I'll call our fundamental business model. \n I mean if and when we make decisions to provide support, it's always targeted and temporary. It's always designed to go to our franchisees who are most in need. I think we've talked previously that we have provided some support for some markets that have been impacted in the region. Obviously, we're continuing to look at the facts and circumstances and continue to work incredibly closely with our DL partners. \n I would just say that the level of support that's been provided so far has not gotten to what I'll call a significant level. But obviously, we're continuing to stay close and work very close with our DL partners in the region. \nMike Cieplak: Our next question is from Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler. \nBrian Mullan: Just a question on CosMc's. I wonder if you could just talk about what some of the early learnings are in your tests in both Illinois and Texas. \n And then related to that, can you just talk about how you might plan to approach it from here in terms of how you evaluate the stores, what that decision process looks like if you ever wanted to ultimately build more of them next year or beyond. Any color would be great. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure, Well I'm going to disappoint you, Brian, in telling that there's not a lot to report. I think what we're still seeing is there's a lot of interest in CosMc's that's sort of curiosity driven. And as a result of that, it's tough to get a sense of sort of what are the true kind of underlying performance expectations. \n As we've referenced in our Investor Day, what we're looking at for the ultimate success on this business is we've got to have a business that's driving comparable or stronger ROIC to a traditional McDonald's. There'd be no reason to be putting any capital against CosMc's unless it was neutral to accretive to building a traditional McDonald's. That's going to then be a function of what we see around both the absolute unit volumes in that concept, the margins associated with that and our ability to build these smaller-footprint restaurants at a lower cost than what we're expecting. \n So all of those things are things that we're going to be assessing in our test market. As I've referenced previously, we have 10 -- we plan on opening 10 restaurants. And it will be a function of unit volumes. It will be a function of margins and it will be a function of what the capital that we need to spend to get these things built. All of that will drive our overall assessment of what the ROIC potential is. \nMike Cieplak: We have time for one more question from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. \nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Just following up on the U.S. comps. I know you guys have mentioned the lower-income households and the weakness seen there and maybe some trading into food at home. Just wondering if you can maybe compare that to past slowdowns. I feel like the message has always been the benefit of the quick-service segment. Maybe you lose some on the low end, but importantly, you inherit some who trade down from above, like you said, if everyone is looking for value. \n And when that is a context, I think you mentioned that the system franchisees like the buy-in is there for the incremental value push. I just want to make sure I heard that right, whether there's any sentiment from the biennial in terms of franchisee sentiment, especially with the most recent fundamental easing. \nChristopher Kempczinski: Sure. Well, so I think it's tough to go back and compare the data today versus our last time that there was an economic slowdown. I think the dynamic that you described is what we do typically see in the business. I think, as you also know, Jeff, that our business over-indexes with lower income consumer. So there's that consideration. \n But I would just go back to we recognize that we're in an environment where the consumer is being price discriminating. And again, that's not just something that's low income. I think all consumers are looking for good value for good affordability. And so we're focused on that action. \n In terms of franchisee buy-in, that's a process that we work through in every single market to get alignment with our franchisees on what a national value program would look like, or if it's about launching a new menu item, what that timing of that would look like. So that's work that the U.S. team is doing. In a system that has 2,000 franchisees in the U.S., I think it's -- there are going to be different people in different places on that. And that getting to alignment ultimately comes through conversation. \n And we -- like I said, we've been doing this for 70 years. We know how to get it done. But it just -- it comes through a lot of conversations with U.S. franchisees as it would in any other market. \nIan Borden: Jeff, maybe just 2 quick hooks to what Chris said. I think across markets, I think what our leadership teams are spending time on talking to the business, talking to our franchisees about is what I'll call making sure we've got a street-fighting mentality in the current context. I mean, clearly, the macro is more difficult. Clearly, everybody is fighting for fewer consumers or consumers that are certainly visiting less frequently. And we've got to make sure we've got that street-fighting mentality to win irregardless of the context around us. \n And as I think we've talked a lot today about our position -- our system is positioned with the strength and capability. There's no reason why we shouldn't have the most compelling value and affordability positioning from the focus of a consumer. \n Ultimately, we're going to measure our progress through are we taking share. And I think we are, Chris and I and certainly the leadership teams, are laser-focused on that and that's the opportunity ahead, and we're very focused on that. \nMike Cieplak: Okay. That concludes our call today. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call. You may now disconnect."}]}
