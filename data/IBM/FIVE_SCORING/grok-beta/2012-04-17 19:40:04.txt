IBM's Q1 earnings showed a 15% increase in operating EPS, indicating strong profit and cash flow performance. The company has increased its full-year EPS guidance by $0.15, suggesting confidence in future stability and growth. Key drivers for this performance include better-than-expected software and services growth, cost management initiatives like workforce rebalancing, and strategic focus on growth markets which consistently outperform major markets. Specifically:
- **Software**: Growth centered around high-value offerings in analytics, cloud computing, and core middleware, with notable share gains in critical markets.
- **Hardware**: A strong first quarter last year led to a high comparison base, but IBM's new offerings like PureSystems are anticipated to contribute positively in the second half.
- **Services**: Despite challenges in Japan and the public sector, the company managed to drive strong profit growth through productivity initiatives, a balanced portfolio, and mix towards higher margin offerings. 

Given these factors, the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) outlook for IBM's stock price should benefit from the positive guidance update and robust start to the year. This implies a positive immediate reaction in the market.
