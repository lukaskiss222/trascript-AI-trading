IBM's Q4 earnings call highlighted several key factors likely to impact its stock price in the short term. While the company reaffirmed its long-term 2015 earnings targets and showed strengths in software, services, and financing, persistent challenges in hardware (specifically System z, Power, Storage, and X86) and growth market underperformance, particularly in China, could pressure stock performance. The lower initial EPS guidance for 2014 due to strategic actions like workforce rebalancing and divestitures might cause short-term investor hesitancy, compounded by currency headwinds. Meanwhile, positive moves such as  the launch of the Watson Group and IBM's plans to address hardware business model issues signal long-term resilience, but short-term reactions might be overshadowed by immediate EPS concerns and market uncertainties.
