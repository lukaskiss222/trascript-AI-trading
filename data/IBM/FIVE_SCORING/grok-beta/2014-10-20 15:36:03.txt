IBM's third quarter results failed to meet expectations due to challenges in software revenue, service productivity, and currency headwinds. Their strategic decisions like semiconductor divestitures, while potentially beneficial to margins and allowing reinvestment into growth, signal a shift towards lower short-term revenue with uncertain guidance. These factors, coupled with a notable reduction in EPS outlook, suggest a probable decline in stock value in the immediate future as investors might react negatively to reduced earnings and the expressed longer-term strategic focus.
