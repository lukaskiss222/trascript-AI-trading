While IBM's Q3 2006 earnings showed robust growth in revenue, EPS, and software margins, there are concerns around the services business's revenue growth and bookings. Although the company reported a strong performance in key areas like software and System Z, the lack of growth in long-term signings for services, coupled with the reliance on short-term business improvements, might introduce short-term stock volatility. However, IBM's strong cash flow generation, strategic acquisitions, and focus on high-margin areas likely provide a stable foundation, suggesting short-term pressure might be offset by long-term growth strategies.
