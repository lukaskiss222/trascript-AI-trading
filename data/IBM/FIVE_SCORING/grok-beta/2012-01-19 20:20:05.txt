IBM delivered a strong Q4 performance with 11% EPS growth, highlighting success in software, services, and growth markets. However, the 2012 EPS guidance of at least $14.85 suggests a modest acceleration from 2011's $13.44, with growth expected to be more skewed towards the second half due to anticipated hardware cycles. While this might moderate initial enthusiasm, IBM's focus on cloud, analytics, and share repurchase should maintain investor confidence over the next 1-2 weeks.
