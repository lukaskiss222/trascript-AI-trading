IBM's Q3 earnings call highlights a mixed bag of results with strong performances in services and software, offset by lower revenue in Systems and Technology due to product transitions and a tough compare in System z. The downturn in the financial services sector, especially in the U.S., impacted short-term growth in 3Q, but this appears confined. The overall outlook for 2008 remains supportive, with strong earnings growth projected, a solid balance sheet, robust services backlog, and advancements in higher-margin areas. A slight pullback in LT contract signings was balanced by strong short-term contract growth. Given these factors, IBM should experience minimal pressure in the stock price over the next week or two with opportunity for bounce back on improved performance.
