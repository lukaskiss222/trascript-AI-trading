IBM's Q3 earnings largely met expectations, with robust profit growth driven by margin expansion due to productivity initiatives, improved business mix, and a relatively stable performance in key high-margin areas like software. However, revenue was slightly short, largely due to a falloff in the third month of the quarter attributed to delays in closing some significant software and GBS deals which are expected to roll into Q4, potentially lifting software and hardware revenue growth rates. This points to no immediate negative sell-off but also lacks the catalyst for immediate stock appreciation, suggesting stability or a marginal positive impact in the short term.
