IBM's Q4 earnings call showcased a mix of challenges and strategic advancements. While total revenue was down 12% due to divestitures, currency movements, and business model changes, the company emphasized growth in strategic areas like cloud, analytics, and security, which saw substantial increases. The guidance for 2015 EPS reflects a cautious stance given potential impacts from ongoing currency translation, recent divestitures reducing revenue growth, and shifts in revenue models (e.g., software). However, the shift towards higher value, higher margin businesses, alongside the introduction of new technological innovations (like z13), indicates a positive outlook for market performance in the short term, although the initial EPS range might temper immediate expectations.
