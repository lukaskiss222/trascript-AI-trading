IBM delivered exceptionally strong second quarter results with improvements across all segments, robust free cash flow, and an upward revision to its full-year EPS guidance. Although currencies provided a tailwind, the robust cash management, cost savings from retirement plans, and a focus on high-growth emerging markets demonstrate positive intrinsic growth. Despite potential risks from currency fluctuations, the strategic execution coupled with strong performance metrics suggests a near-term bullish outlook for IBM's stock price.
