The strong 1Q earnings from IBM, particularly the 11% revenue growth and 36% EPS growth, coupled with improved guidance, suggest a positive stock reaction. The focus on emerging markets, successful product launches like the z10 and POWER6, and the strategic guidance towards cost-saving for clients indicate IBM is well-positioned in a challenging economic environment, likely leading to a short-term increase in stock value.
