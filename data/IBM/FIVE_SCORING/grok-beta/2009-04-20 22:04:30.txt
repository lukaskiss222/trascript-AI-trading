IBM's Q1 results showed resilience with a 4% EPS growth despite a revenue decline. The company's strategic shift to higher-value offerings, strong services signings, and continued margin expansion signal a stable short-term outlook.

Overall, IBM's guidance reaffirmation and confidence in its 2010 roadmap suggest a positive impact on its stock price in the next 1â€“2 weeks. [1]
