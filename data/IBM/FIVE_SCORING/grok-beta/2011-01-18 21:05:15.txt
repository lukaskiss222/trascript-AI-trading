IBM’s Q4 results propelled the company to finish the year with strong internals making it their best performance in nearly a decade. Revenue increased across the board, with notable strengths in Hardware and Software, where growth significantly surpassed expectations. Operational metrics like gross margin expansion, and pre-tax income growth suggest robust financial health and the company's positive guidance for 2011 at an 11% growth rate further supports optimism. Given IBM’s transformed business model, all these strongly indicate a positive short-term impact on the stock.
