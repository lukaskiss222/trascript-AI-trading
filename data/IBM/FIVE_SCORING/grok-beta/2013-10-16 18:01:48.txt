IBM's third-quarter earnings call revealed a mixed bag of operational performance, with significant headwinds from the hardware decline, primarily in China, and currency issues, offset by positive developments in services and software. The overall revenue was down, but operational improvements in backlog, especially in GBS, suggest potential stabilization and growth in services. The commentary around hardware stabilization and the expectation of a return to growth in GMU (Growth Markets Unit) after China's economic planning stabilizes indirectly supports a more bullish short-term outlook than indicated by third-quarter results. Given the focus on cost savings, backlog improvement, and strategic initiatives like cloud growth, these developments suggest that IBM's stock might see a mild positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks as the market anticipates better performance in the subsequent quarter and looks forward to IBM's ability to meet its 2015 targets.
