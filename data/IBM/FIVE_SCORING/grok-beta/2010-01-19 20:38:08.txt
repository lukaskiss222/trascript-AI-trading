IBM's Q4 earnings showcased their strategic positioning and adaptability in tough times. Despite a slight revenue miss, optimism is driven by improved gross margins in key segments, significant investments in growth areas like business analytics and cloud computing, and expectations for a stronger revenue growth into Q1. Management's outlook for EPS growth in 2010, aiming for at least double digits, reaffirms their confidence. The execution of a leaner cost base could provide real advantages as economic conditions improve, likely leading to a positive stock reaction in the short term due to these promising growth signals.
