This transcript from IBMâ€™s Q1 earnings presentation provides solid indicators for short-term stock performance. IBM reported an EPS of $1.08, up 27% year over year, and revenue growth of 4% excluding currency and PC business divestiture effects. While there are ongoing uncertainties in the hardware mix and challenges in some regions like Japan, the company's focus on high-value solutions, persistent cost management efforts, and positive trends in key software products like WebSphere and Tivoli suggest resilience and potential for growth. The commitment to operational discipline, along with an optimistic view of future performances, should buoy investor confidence in the short term.
