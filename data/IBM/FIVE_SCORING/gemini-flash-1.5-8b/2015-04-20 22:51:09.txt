IBM's earnings call highlights strong growth in strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, social, mobile) and high-end hardware (mainframe).  However, overall revenue was flat, primarily due to a significant impact from currency translation and the divestiture of non-strategic businesses.  Management is confident in the long-term strategy and expects continued strong performance in strategic initiatives, though there are short-term challenges in other areas.
