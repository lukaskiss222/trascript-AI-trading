IBM's earnings call highlighted revenue declines, but strong profitability improvements excluding the divested PC business.  Management emphasized continued focus on productivity initiatives and cost-cutting measures. Positive growth in key segments like storage and microelectronics, along with a strong services backlog, suggest a generally positive outlook, though currency fluctuations present a short-term headwind.  Short-term impact will likely be driven by investor reaction to the currency impact.
