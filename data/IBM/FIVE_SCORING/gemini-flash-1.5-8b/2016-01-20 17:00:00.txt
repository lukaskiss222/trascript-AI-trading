IBM's earnings call highlighted continued progress in the transformation to a cloud-centric company.  Strong growth in strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics) and a significant backlog in services suggest ongoing positive momentum. However, currency headwinds and reduced transaction-based software sales remain concerns for short-term performance.  Given the ongoing transformation and investment in future growth areas, the near-term impact on the stock is likely to be moderate, with potential for a slight dip in the short-term but with underlying positivity.
