IBM's earnings call shows strong performance across various segments, particularly in growth markets.  Increased guidance for 2011 EPS and significant backlog growth suggest continued positive momentum in the short term.  The company's focus on key growth initiatives, like cloud computing, and strong performance in hardware and software bode well for continued stock price appreciation in the next 1-2 weeks.
