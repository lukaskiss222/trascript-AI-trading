IBM's Q1 2021 earnings call highlighted a positive trajectory, with revenue growth in key segments like Cloud & Cognitive Software and Systems, and a return to growth in consulting. Management expressed confidence in the overall spend environment improving, especially in the Americas, although some caution remains in other regions.  Strong free cash flow and a healthy balance sheet further support positive momentum.
