IBM's Q1 2023 earnings call highlighted continued strength in Software and Consulting, particularly in Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing.  Management noted some deceleration in U.S. Consulting, but characterized this as a push-out of discretionary projects, not cancellations.  The company emphasized its AI strategy and productivity initiatives as key differentiators and drivers of future growth.  The call suggests a short-term (1-2 weeks) positive impact on the stock due to the solid financial performance and confirmation of ongoing focus on key growth areas.
