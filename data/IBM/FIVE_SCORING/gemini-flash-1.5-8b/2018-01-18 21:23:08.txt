IBM's earnings call highlighted continued growth in cloud and strategic imperatives, including strong performance in the Systems segment (especially IBM Z).  Management focused on the positive trajectory of the second half of 2017, and projected a stabilized margin for 2018.  However, there were some concerns regarding some specific areas of the traditional analytics business being down-shifted to the cloud, as well as ongoing challenges in EMEA, which may result in some short-term stock price pressure.
