IBM's earnings call indicates a strong first quarter, with revenue growth exceeding expectations, driven primarily by organic growth in Software and Consulting, and the contribution from the Kyndryl acquisition.  Management is optimistic about continued strong demand for IBM's technology, particularly in hybrid cloud and AI, and expects the revenue growth trend to continue.  The impact of macroeconomic factors like inflation and a strengthening U.S. dollar were partially offset by a robust performance in Software and Consulting.
