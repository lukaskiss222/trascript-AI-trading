IBM's earnings call highlighted strong growth in strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, etc.) but also acknowledged challenges in legacy software and certain geographic regions (BRIC countries).  Management emphasized the ongoing transformation to higher-value services and solutions, while noting that the short-term impact of this shift is a decline in profits from certain segments.  The stock price is likely to see a short-term fluctuation from this mixed bag of positive and negative drivers.
