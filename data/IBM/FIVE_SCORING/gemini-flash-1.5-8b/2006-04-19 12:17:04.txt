IBM's Q1 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations with 27% EPS growth and 4% revenue growth (excluding PCs and currency).  Management expressed confidence in achieving analyst estimates for the remainder of 2006, highlighting strong service signings and the potential for further improvement in emerging markets. While hardware sales were down, management attributed this to a product transition and mix shift rather than broader market pressures, citing good performance in microelectronics, storage, and System X servers.  The outlook suggests a positive near-term impact on the stock price.
