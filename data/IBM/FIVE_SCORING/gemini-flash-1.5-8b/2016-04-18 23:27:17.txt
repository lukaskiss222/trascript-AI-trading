IBM's earnings call highlighted strong growth in strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, etc.) but a slight revenue decline, mostly due to currency headwinds.  Management emphasized significant investments in transformation, including acquisitions (e.g., Truven), which are expected to drive future revenue and profit growth. While the upcoming second quarter is anticipated to show profit improvement, short-term impacts from workforce restructuring and currency fluctuations are noted.
