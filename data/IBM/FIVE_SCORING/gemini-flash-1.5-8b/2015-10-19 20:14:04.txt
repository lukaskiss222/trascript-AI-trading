IBM's earnings call highlighted continued progress in strategic imperatives like cloud and analytics, but also acknowledged slower-than-expected transformation in Global Business Services (GBS).  Management noted a weaker-than-expected end-of-quarter transaction slowdown and adjusted full-year EPS guidance downward, reflecting these concerns.  The negative short-term impact on the stock price is likely due to the downward guidance and concerns regarding the pace of the GBS transition.
