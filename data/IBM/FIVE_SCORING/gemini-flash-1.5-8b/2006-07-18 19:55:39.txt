IBM's earnings show solid software performance, driven by key middleware products like WebSphere and Tivoli, despite some slower growth in hardware and services.  Management attributes this to strong demand for SOA products and successful investments in acquisition and internal development.  They expect continued solid earnings per share growth for 2006 in line with analyst estimates.
