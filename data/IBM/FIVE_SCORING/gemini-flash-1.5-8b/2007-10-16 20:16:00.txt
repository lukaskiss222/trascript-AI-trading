IBM's earnings call highlighted strong services performance, with double-digit growth in both Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.  However, the Systems and Technology segment faced challenges due to product transitions and a slowdown in large deals, particularly in the financial services sector.  Management expressed confidence in closing these deals in Q4 and achieving double-digit software profit growth.  This suggests a short-term focus on executing on the current quarter and gaining back momentum in the Systems and Technology business.
