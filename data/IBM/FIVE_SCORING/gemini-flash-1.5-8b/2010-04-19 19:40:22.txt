IBM's Q1 earnings call shows strong performance across segments, particularly in software and consulting.  Management cited significant growth in consulting and business analytics, as well as improvements in hardware (System x, storage).  Increased EPS expectations and the substantial share repurchases suggest a positive outlook, though a key concern is the weakness in Application Management Services (AMS) signings and the uncertainty of a potential impact from the anticipated decline of PLM sales, which will likely affect Q1 2010 performance.
