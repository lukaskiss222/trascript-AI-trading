IBM's earnings call highlights significant strategic shifts, but short-term negative impacts.  The divestitures and planned restructuring will create short-term headwinds due to lower revenue and potential charges, making the 1-2 week outlook likely negative.  However, management's focus on cloud, data analytics, and mobile indicates a long-term positive strategy, although the immediate effect is not necessarily positive.
