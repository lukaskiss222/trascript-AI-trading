IBM's earnings call indicated strong performance in strategic imperatives (cloud, security, mobile, analytics) and a stable overall revenue, largely in line with expectations, despite some headwinds.  Management is focused on investments in cognitive solutions and cloud, and discussed successful partnerships and acquisitions that strengthen the company's long-term position.  While some core business segments (systems) experienced declines, the optimistic guidance and focus on strategic growth suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
