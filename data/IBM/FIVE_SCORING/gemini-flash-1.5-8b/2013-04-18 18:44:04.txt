IBM's Q1 earnings call indicated a short-term stock impact of potential mixed results.  While management emphasized growth in some areas (Services backlog, cloud, etc.), revenue decline and execution issues in key segments (software, mainframe, and certain hardware) are a concern.  The projected workforce rebalancing charges and associated EPS impact likely contribute to short-term investor uncertainty.
