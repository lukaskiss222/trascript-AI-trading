IBM's earnings call highlights strong Q4 performance, driven by robust Red Hat revenue, growing cloud adoption (Cloud Paks, OpenShift), and impressive mainframe sales (z15).  Management projects continued revenue and EPS growth in 2020, with continued investments in hybrid cloud and AI, and structural actions to enhance GTS profitability.  While some headwinds are expected, the overall tone is optimistic, potentially supporting a short-term positive stock reaction.
