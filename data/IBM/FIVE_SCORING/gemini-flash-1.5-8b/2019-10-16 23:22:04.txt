IBM's Q3 2019 earnings show strong performance in cloud and cognitive software, and Global Business Services, with considerable growth in signings and cloud adoption.  However, Global Technology Services (GTS) saw lower-than-expected client volumes in key markets, impacting revenue and profitability in the near term.  Management emphasizes short-term margin and cash management for GTS while continuing to invest in cloud capabilities and  expecting sustainable revenue growth in 2020.
