IBM's Q2 2019 earnings call highlighted strong performance in Cloud & Cognitive Software, driven by hybrid cloud offerings and security.  Management emphasized the Red Hat acquisition as a key driver of future growth, though the acquisition is initially EPS-dilutive.  The call also showed solid free cash flow generation and margin expansion, suggesting a positive outlook for the company, potentially offset by uncertainty around enterprise demand and the impact of Red Hat on guidance.
