IBM's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted strong performance in high-value segments like Cloud and GBS, with cloud growth accelerating to 12%.  Management maintained full-year guidance, despite some headwinds in emerging markets and the IBM Z product cycle.  The tone suggests a focus on long-term strategy, including the Red Hat acquisition, and a continued prioritization of higher-margin services.  This likely leads to a positive but muted reaction in the short term, with investors reassessing the impact of the Red Hat acquisition on their financial outlook.
