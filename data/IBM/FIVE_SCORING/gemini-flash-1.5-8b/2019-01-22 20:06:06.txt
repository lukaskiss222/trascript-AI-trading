IBM's earnings call highlights continued strong performance in services and software, particularly in hybrid cloud and AI offerings.  Management emphasizes the positive client response to the Red Hat acquisition, which, while not included in 2019 guidance, positions the company for future growth.  The 2019 guidance includes expected headwinds from currency and divestitures, but  management expresses confidence in achieving at least $13.90 EPS and $12 billion in free cash flow, supported by operating leverage and a focus on high-value segments.
