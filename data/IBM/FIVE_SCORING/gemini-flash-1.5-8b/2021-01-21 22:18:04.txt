IBM's earnings call highlights a cautious outlook for the first half of 2021, citing shorter-term client engagements and product cycle dynamics.  However, management expresses confidence in the second half, anticipating a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in GBS and improved software performance driven by Red Hat.  The company's focus on hybrid cloud and AI, along with ongoing investments,  suggests a gradual recovery, potentially leading to a positive stock price impact in later quarters.
