IBM's earnings call highlighted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on client priorities, particularly in the software segment, with noticeable client hesitation on CapEx spending toward critical business functions.  Management cited a shift in client focus to maintaining operations and preserving cash, leading to a pause on large software projects. While the company's hardware and services divisions showed relative strength, and a growth in cloud revenue,  IBM withdrew its 2020 financial guidance due to the unprecedented economic uncertainty. This suggests potential short-term negative impact on the stock price due to the uncertainty and potential revenue shortfall caused by the pandemic.
