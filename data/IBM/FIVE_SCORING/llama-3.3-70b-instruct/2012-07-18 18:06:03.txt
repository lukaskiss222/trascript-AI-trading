IBM's Q2 earnings report showed mixed results, with revenue growth impacted by currency fluctuations and a tough compare to last year's strong performance. However, the company delivered strong profit growth, driven by margin expansion and a solid performance in its growth markets. Management increased its full-year guidance for operating EPS to at least $15.10, driven by confidence in its business model and growth initiatives. While there are some headwinds, including currency dynamics and a challenging macroeconomic environment, IBM's strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheet position it well for the second half of the year.
