IBM's Q1 earnings call showed solid performance, with 7% revenue growth and 12% EPS growth, driven by strong performance in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Despite weakness in the U.S., particularly in the enterprise sector, the company expects improvement in the second quarter. IBM's services and software segments delivered strong results, with significant investments in emerging markets and high-value capabilities. The company's guidance for the full year remains unchanged, with expected earnings per share growth of 11%, and potentially closer to 12% including the gain from the sale of the printer business.
