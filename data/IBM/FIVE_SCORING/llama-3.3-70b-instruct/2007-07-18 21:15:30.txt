IBM's Q2 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and successful execution of the company's strategic plans. The company's revenue grew 9% year-over-year, with a 6% growth in constant currency, driven by strong performance in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The gross margin expanded to 41.8%, and the EPS grew 19% year-over-year, excluding the gain from the printer sale. The company also generated strong free cash flow of $2.7 billion, up $1.7 billion year-to-year. Given the company's solid execution and strong financial performance, I expect the stock to experience a positive impact in the short-term.
