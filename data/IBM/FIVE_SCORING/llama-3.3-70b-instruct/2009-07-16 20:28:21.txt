IBM's Q2 earnings transcript reveals a strong quarterly performance, with EPS growing 18% year-over-year to $2.32, driven by margin expansion and a lower share count. The company's strategic transformation, including its shift to higher-value businesses and global integration, has positioned it well for long-term growth. Despite revenue declines, IBM's software and services segments delivered double-digit profit growth, and the company expects this trend to continue. With a strong cash position and improved operating leverage, IBM is well-placed to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
