IBM's Q2 earnings report showed mixed results, with revenue growth of 2% and EPS growth of 13%, despite a significant currency headwind. The company's services segment returned to growth, and software performance was excellent, with Key-Branded Middleware up 10% at constant currency. However, the systems and technology segment saw a decline in Power Systems revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin due to mix. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to overcome currency fluctuations and delivered a strong EPS growth.

Given the steady improvement in the business, margin expansion, and strong EPS growth, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price. The company's ability to navigate through currency headwinds and deliver strong results positions it well for future growth.
