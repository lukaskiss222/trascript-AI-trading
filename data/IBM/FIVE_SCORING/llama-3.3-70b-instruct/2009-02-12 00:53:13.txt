Kenexa's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving record annual sales but facing significant headwinds in the current economic environment. The lowered 2008 guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts signal short-term challenges. However, management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
