IBM's Q1 earnings report showed mixed results, with revenue declines in certain segments, but strong growth in others, such as cloud and Smarter Planet initiatives. The company's guidance for the year remains unchanged, with expected operating EPS of at least $16.70. While there are some execution challenges and macroeconomic headwinds, the company is taking actions to improve performance, including workforce rebalancing and investments in key growth areas. The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to the mixed results, but the company's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning value to shareholders should support the stock price over time.
