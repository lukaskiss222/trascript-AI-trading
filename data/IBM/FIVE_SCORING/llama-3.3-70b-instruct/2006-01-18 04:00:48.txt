IBM's Q4 earnings report showed mixed results, with revenue declining 12% year-over-year but earnings per share increasing 20%. The company's hardware and software segments performed well, with strong growth in storage, microelectronics, and key branded middleware products. However, the services segment saw a decline in revenue, primarily due to weaker short-term signings and a high level of backlog erosion. Despite this, IBM's profit margins improved, driven by benefits from restructuring actions and a better contract profile. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to drive margin improvements and achieve mid-single-digit revenue growth in the second half of 2006.
