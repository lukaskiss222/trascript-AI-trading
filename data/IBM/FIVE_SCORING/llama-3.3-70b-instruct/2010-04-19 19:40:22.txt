IBM's earnings transcript reveals a strong first quarter with improved revenue growth, solid margin expansion, and a significant increase in free cash flow. The company's software business performed exceptionally well, with revenue growth of 11% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for business analytics, storage management, and other key areas. Consulting signings also showed a notable improvement, up 18% year-over-year, which is a positive indicator for future revenue growth. Management's guidance update, increasing EPS expectations to at least $11.20, suggests confidence in the company's ability to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the year.
