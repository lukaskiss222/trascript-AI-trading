IBM's third-quarter earnings report showed strong revenue growth, margin expansion, and a significant increase in earnings per share. The company's growth markets, including the BRIC countries, had a stellar performance, with revenue up 13% at constant currency. The Systems and Technology segment also had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% and pre-tax income up 46%. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to achieve its 2015 roadmap, with a focus on driving revenue growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. Given the company's solid performance and positive outlook, I predict a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
