IBM's Q3 earnings report revealed mixed signals, with the company achieving record earnings per share but missing revenue expectations. The main challenges were in the growth markets, particularly China, where revenue declined 22% due to a slowdown in demand. However, management expressed confidence in improving performance, driven by growth initiatives in areas like cloud, business analytics, and Smarter Planet solutions. Despite the short-term headwinds, IBM maintained its full-year EPS guidance and expressed confidence in achieving its 2015 roadmap objectives. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key markets, but the company's long-term prospects remain intact.
