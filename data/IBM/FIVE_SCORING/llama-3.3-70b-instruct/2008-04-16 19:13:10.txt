IBM's strong Q1 performance, with 11% revenue growth and 36% EPS growth, driven by solid performances in services and software, suggests a positive short-term outlook. Management's increased guidance for 2008, citing strong operating performance and a solid balance sheet, further supports this view. While some areas, like System x and OEM Technology, showed weakness, these are lower-margin businesses with little impact on overall profit. The company's ability to deliver value propositions that save customers costs and conserve capital, particularly in emerging markets, positions it well for continued growth.
