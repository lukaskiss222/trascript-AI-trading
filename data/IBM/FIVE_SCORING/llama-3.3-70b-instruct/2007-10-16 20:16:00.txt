IBM's Q3 earnings call revealed strong performance in services, with both Global Technology Services and Global Business Services delivering double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion. However, the company's hardware business was impacted by product transitions and tough compares, while software growth was affected by large deal deferrals. Despite these challenges, management expressed confidence in meeting full-year objectives, driven by the strength of the services business and a solid financial base. The stock is likely to remain stable in the short term, with a positive outlook for the fourth quarter.
