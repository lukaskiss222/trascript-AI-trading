IBM's Q1 earnings report showed mixed results, with revenue declining 10% year-over-year but improving 4% when excluding the impact of the divested PC business and currency fluctuations. The company's services segment saw signs of turnaround, with improved growth and margins, while hardware performance was impacted by product transitions and mix. Software revenue was up, driven by strong growth in middleware, particularly WebSphere and Tivoli. Given the company's solid cash performance, strong balance sheet, and confidence in its long-term business model, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
