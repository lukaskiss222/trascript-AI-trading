IBM's earnings transcript revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company beating expectations in some areas while facing challenges in others. The company's software and services segments performed well, with software revenue growing 5% year-over-year and services backlog increasing 7% at constant currency. However, hardware sales were weak, with revenue declining 12% year-over-year. Despite these challenges, IBM's management expressed confidence in the company's ability to achieve its long-term objectives, including reaching $20 in operating EPS by 2015. The company also announced a $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge, which will impact earnings in the short term but is expected to yield benefits in the long term. 

Overall, while IBM's results were not entirely positive, the company's strong services and software performance, combined with its confident outlook, suggest that the stock will likely experience a positive impact in the short term.
