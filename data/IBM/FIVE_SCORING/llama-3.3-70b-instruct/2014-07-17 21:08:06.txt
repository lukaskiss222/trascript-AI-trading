IBM's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company's strategic imperatives showing strong growth, while its core franchises faced some challenges. The company's revenue was down 2% year-over-year, but its operating earnings per share were up 34%. IBM's CEO and CFO expressed confidence in the company's ability to drive growth in the second half of the year, particularly in its Software segment. However, the company's Services business faced some headwinds, including a decline in signings and revenue growth. Overall, IBM's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the mixed results, but the company's long-term prospects remain positive.
