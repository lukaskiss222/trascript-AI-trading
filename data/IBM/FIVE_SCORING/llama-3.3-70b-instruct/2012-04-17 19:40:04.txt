IBM's Q1 earnings call revealed strong margin and profit performance, driven by the company's focus on productivity and growth initiatives, particularly in software and services. The company's operating EPS of $2.78 was up 15% year-over-year, and management increased its full-year 2012 guidance to at least $15. While the company faces headwinds in certain areas, such as Japan and public sector, its growth markets and software segments continue to show strength. With a solid balance sheet and continued investments in key areas, IBM is well-positioned for long-term growth.
