### Analysis

IBM's Q3 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported $23.7 billion in revenue, a 4% decline year-over-year, primarily driven by currency impacts and a slowdown in growth markets, particularly China. The company also reported a 10% increase in operating EPS to $3.99, driven by improvements in gross and net margins. However, the company's performance in growth markets was down 9% at constant currency, with China down 22%, impacting hardware sales significantly. Despite these challenges, IBM remains optimistic about its growth initiatives in Smarter Planet, business analytics, and cloud, which are expected to drive higher margins and revenue growth in the future. The company also expects to return to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2014, driven by improved execution and the resolution of macroeconomic issues in China. Overall, IBM's performance in Q3 was mixed, with currency impacts and growth market slowdowns offsetting improvements in software and services. The company's long-term growth prospects remain strong, but short-term challenges in hardware and growth markets could impact its stock price in the next 1–2 weeks.
