### Analysis

IBM's Q3 2019 earnings call highlighted a mixed performance with strong growth in key areas like Cloud & Cognitive Software and Global Business Services, while Global Technology Services (GTS) faced challenges due to lower client volumes. The company's focus on hybrid cloud and digital transformation is paying off, as seen in the robust growth of Cloud & Cognitive Software and the strong start of Red Hat integration. The announcement of the z15 mainframe and the DS8900 storage system also signals innovation in hardware. However, the Q3 results were impacted by lower volumes in GTS and transaction processing platforms, which could continue to affect the company's near-term performance. The company's guidance for Q4 and 2020 remains positive, but the short-term outlook is clouded by the challenges faced in GTS and the impact of the stronger dollar.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on IBM's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the mixed performance and the ongoing challenges in GTS. The company's long-term growth prospects remain promising, but near-term headwinds could lead to a moderate correction in the stock price. Therefore, the rating for the short-term impact on the stock price is:
