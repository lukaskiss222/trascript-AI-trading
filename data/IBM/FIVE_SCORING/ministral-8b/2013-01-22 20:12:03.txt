**Analysis:**
IBM's earnings call highlighted strong performance in the Software business, with significant growth and margin improvement. The company expects a robust product cycle for Power7 Plus and plans to continue optimizing its operating margins through mix shifts and cost reductions. However, the call provided limited clarity on the growth prospects for GBS and GTS, which may weigh on the stock in the short term.

**Conclusion:**
IBM's stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the lack of clear guidance on GBS and GTS growth, but the overall positive outlook for Software and margin improvements should provide support. The stock may experience some volatility but is unlikely to react strongly in either direction.

**Rating:** [0]
