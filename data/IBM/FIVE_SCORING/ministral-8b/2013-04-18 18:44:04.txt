**Analysis:**

IBM's Q1 results were mixed, with revenue down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to currency impacts and execution issues. The company's guidance for the year remains unchanged, with EPS of at least $16.70. Management highlighted several challenges, including the impact of the Yen, execution issues in software and mainframe businesses, and underperformance in certain product lines. However, they also pointed to strong backlog growth and a pipeline of rollover transactions, which should drive growth in the second quarter. The company's focus on cost-cutting, workforce rebalancing, and strategic initiatives suggests a long-term view, but short-term challenges may weigh on the stock.

**Conclusion:**

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered revenue growth and execution issues, but long-term growth prospects and strategic initiatives may provide support. The rating is:

**0**
