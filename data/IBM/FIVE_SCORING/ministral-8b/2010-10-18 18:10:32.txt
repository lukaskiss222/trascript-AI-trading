### Analysis

IBM's earnings call highlighted strong performance across multiple segments, with notable improvements in revenue growth and margin expansion. The company's focus on growth markets and strategic investments in areas like IT infrastructure and industry leadership is paying off, as shown by the robust growth in BRIC countries and the continued expansion in the growth markets.

Despite the lower tax rate, which added $0.16 to earnings per share, the company raised its full-year EPS guidance to at least $11.40, reflecting its strong performance and expectations for continued growth. The company's steady improvement in business performance, driven by strong revenue growth and margin expansion, indicates a solid foundation for future growth.

However, concerns remain around the outsourcing business, where signings have been down for three quarters. While the company expects this to be a temporary issue, driven by the delayed closing of large deals, the continued underperformance in outsourcing signings could be a cause for concern.

Overall, IBM's strong performance and continued investment in growth areas suggest a positive outlook for the stock. The company's ability to deliver consistent earnings growth and its focus on strategic investments position it well for long-term success.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on IBM's stock is likely to be positive, driven by the strong earnings performance and the raised EPS guidance. The company's focus on growth markets and strategic investments, along with its ability to deliver consistent earnings growth, suggests a solid foundation for future growth. However, concerns around the outsourcing business could temper some of the enthusiasm around the stock. Overall, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
