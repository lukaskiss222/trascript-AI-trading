### Analysis

IBM's Q1 2023 earnings report shows a mixed bag of results. The company reported mid-single-digit revenue growth at constant currency, which aligns with their midterm model. However, there are concerns about a potential slowdown in consulting demand, particularly in the United States, which could impact revenue growth. Despite these concerns, IBM remains confident in their software and hybrid cloud growth prospects. The company also highlighted their focus on productivity and cost-cutting measures, which should support their revenue and free cash flow growth targets. Overall, while there are some headwinds, IBM's strategic focus on hybrid cloud and AI, along with their strong balance sheet and cash position, should help them navigate the current economic uncertainty.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on IBM's stock price is expected to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong performance in Q1, along with their strategic focus on high-growth areas like hybrid cloud and AI, should provide some support to the stock price. However, the uncertainty around consulting demand and the potential impact of macroeconomic factors could create some volatility in the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
