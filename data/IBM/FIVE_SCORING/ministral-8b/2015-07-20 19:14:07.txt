### Analysis

IBM's second quarter and first half results showed mixed signals. The company achieved strong growth in strategic imperatives, particularly in cloud and analytics, while also facing headwinds from currency impacts and divestitures. The guidance for the full year was maintained, with EPS expected to be between $15.75 and $16.50. The company continues to invest heavily in strategic imperatives, which is expected to drive long-term growth. However, the software segment's performance was a concern, with a 3% decline in constant currency terms, driven by headwinds from the operating system and the impact of currency. The company's focus on shifting resources to higher-value offerings and improving productivity in the services business is expected to drive margin improvements over time. Overall, while there are short-term challenges, the company's long-term strategy and investments in strategic imperatives suggest potential for growth.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be negative due to the mixed results and the ongoing challenges in the software segment. However, the company's long-term strategy and investments in strategic imperatives suggest potential for growth, which could lead to a recovery in the stock price over the long term.
