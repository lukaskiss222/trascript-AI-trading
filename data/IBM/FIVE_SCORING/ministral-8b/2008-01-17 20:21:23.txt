**Analysis:**
IBM's Q4 and full-year results were strong, with record revenue and earnings per share growth. The company's global reach, strong services momentum, and robust cash position are key drivers of its performance. However, the economic uncertainty and potential slowdown in IT spending pose risks. The company's guidance for 2008 is conservative, with EPS growth expected to be 15% to 16%. The stock may experience short-term volatility due to economic uncertainty and potential changes in guidance.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to economic uncertainty and potential changes in guidance. However, the company's strong fundamentals and global reach suggest that it is well-positioned to weather the current economic environment. The stock may rally if economic conditions improve or if the company provides positive surprises.

**Rating:** [1]
