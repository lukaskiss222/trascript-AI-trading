### Analysis:

IBM's Q4 and full-year 2019 results were strong, with revenue growth of 3% at constant currency, excluding divestitures. The company delivered $77 billion in revenue, $12.81 in operating earnings per share, and $12 billion in free cash flow. The company's strategic focus on hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum computing, along with the successful Red Hat acquisition, drove strong performance. Management highlighted the benefits of the IBM and Red Hat combination, including the growth of Red Hat's normalized revenue and the strong performance of Cloud Paks. However, the company faces headwinds from the divested businesses and the impact of the Red Hat acquisition on purchase accounting and cash taxes.

In the 2020 outlook, IBM expects to grow revenue, operating earnings per share, and free cash flow. The company plans to continue investing in hybrid cloud and data and AI capabilities, drive productivity, and take structural actions, especially in GTS. The company expects to deliver at least $13.35 in operating earnings per share for the year and approximately $12.5 billion in free cash flow.

### Conclusion:

IBM's strong Q4 and full-year 2019 results, driven by the successful Red Hat acquisition and strategic focus on hybrid cloud and AI, suggest a positive outlook for the stock in the short term. The company's guidance for 2020, including revenue growth, operating earnings per share, and free cash flow growth, further supports this positive outlook. However, the company faces headwinds from the divested businesses and the impact of the Red Hat acquisition on purchase accounting and cash taxes. Overall, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
