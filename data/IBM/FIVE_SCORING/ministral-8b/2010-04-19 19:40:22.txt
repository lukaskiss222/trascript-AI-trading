### Analysis

IBM's Q1 2010 earnings call revealed a strong performance, with earnings per share (EPS) up 16% year-over-year, driven by improvements in revenue growth and cost management. The company's focus on business analytics and transformation initiatives, particularly in consulting services, has shown promising results. The guidance for the year was increased to at least $11.20 EPS, reflecting optimism about the company's ability to continue its growth trajectory. The call also highlighted the company's strong balance sheet and liquidity position, with $14 billion in cash and a conservative debt-to-cap ratio. The main concerns include the potential impact of the PLM transaction on software revenue growth and the uncertainty around the IT spending environment.

### Conclusion

The earnings call indicates a positive outlook for IBM, with strong revenue growth and cost management. The increased guidance for the year suggests that the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. However, the impact of the PLM transaction on software revenue growth and the uncertainty around the IT spending environment are potential risks that investors should be aware of. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be positive, given the strong performance and increased guidance.
