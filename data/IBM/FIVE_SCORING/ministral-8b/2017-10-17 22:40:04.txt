### Analysis:

IBM's Q3 2017 earnings call provided a mixed bag of results, with some positive signs and ongoing challenges. The company reported strong performance in Cognitive Solutions and Systems segments, driven by the successful launch of the new z14 mainframe and growth in cloud and security offerings. However, challenges persist in GBS, with application management still facing headwinds and margins remaining under pressure. The company expects to continue improving margins and revenue growth in the coming quarters, but the outlook remains uncertain due to ongoing transformation efforts and the impact of the mainframe cycle.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on IBM's stock price is expected to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong performance in key segments and its focus on strategic imperatives provide a positive outlook. However, ongoing challenges in GBS and the uncertainty surrounding the mainframe cycle may temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the stock is likely to experience moderate volatility in the coming weeks, with potential for short-term gains if the company continues to execute its strategic initiatives effectively.
