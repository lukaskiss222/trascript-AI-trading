### Analysis

IBM's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed several key points that have implications for the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks:

1. **Strong Performance in Strategic Areas**: IBM reported strong growth in its strategic imperatives, particularly in cloud, analytics, security, and mobile solutions. This indicates that IBM is successfully shifting its focus towards high-value, high-margin areas.

2. **Growth and Margin Stability**: The company expects PTI margins to expand in 2017, which is a positive sign for earnings growth. While gross margins may not necessarily grow, the focus on PTI margin expansion suggests that IBM is managing its costs effectively.

3. **Tax Headwind**: The company expects a tax headwind in 2017, which could impact earnings. However, this is expected to be a manageable headwind and not significantly impact the overall financial performance.

4. **Workforce Rebalancing Savings**: IBM expects to see significant savings from its workforce rebalancing efforts, which will contribute to improved profitability in 2017.

5. **Mainframe Cycle**: IBM is likely to see the impact of the mainframe product cycle later in the year, which could drive additional revenue growth. The focus on Blockchain as a workload driver for the mainframe is a positive sign for the future.

### Conclusion

Given the strong performance in strategic areas, expected margin stability, and a manageable tax headwind, IBM's stock is likely to see a positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks. The company's focus on high-value, high-margin areas and its ability to manage costs effectively are positive signs for future earnings growth.
