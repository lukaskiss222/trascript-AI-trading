Based on the earnings transcript, IBM reported strong financial performance in 2014, with revenue of $24.1 billion and net income of $5.8 billion. The company's strategic imperatives, which include cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security, grew at a double-digit rate of 16%. However, the company's guidance for 2015 was more conservative, with EPS expected to decline to a range of $15.75 to $16.50. This decline is primarily due to the impact of currency fluctuations, divestitures, and the need to invest in strategic initiatives. Additionally, the company's free cash flow is expected to be relatively flat in 2015, with a realization rate of 79%. Overall, while IBM's strategic imperatives are driving strong growth, the company's guidance for 2015 suggests that the stock may face short-term headwinds. However, the company's long-term growth trajectory and investments in strategic initiatives suggest that the stock may have potential for growth in the longer term.
