### Analysis:

IBM's Q2 earnings report shows a mixed performance with a slight decline in revenue and EPS due to currency impacts and workforce rebalancing charges. However, the company's management expressed confidence in its ability to achieve its full-year EPS target of at least $16.90, excluding the workforce rebalancing charge. This confidence is driven by strong performance in high-margin businesses like software and systems, as well as robust growth initiatives in Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, and Cloud. Additionally, the company's services business showed improved backlog growth and cost management, which will likely contribute to better performance in the second half of the year. The company's guidance for the second half of the year is positive, and management expects to see sequential improvements in key segments.

### Conclusion:

IBM's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term (1â€“2 weeks) due to the company's strong performance in high-margin businesses and growth initiatives, as well as the positive guidance for the second half of the year. The company's ability to manage costs and improve its services business will also contribute to a positive outlook. However, the stock may face some short-term pressure due to currency impacts and the uncertainty around the large divestiture project.
