### Analysis

IBM's Q4 and full-year earnings call highlighted mixed performance, with notable growth in software and services, but significant challenges in hardware and currency headwinds. The company's guidance for 2014 projects $18 of operating EPS, driven by a combination of improved operational performance, reduced currency headwinds, and the positive impact of the sale of the customer care business. The key pivot points for achieving this EPS target include improving hardware performance, increasing productivity, and maintaining strong growth in software and services. Additionally, IBM's strategy of investing in growth areas like Smarter Planet, business analytics, and cloud, as well as its commitment to returning value to shareholders, will be crucial for achieving its 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.

### Conclusion

IBM's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the mixed performance in the fourth quarter and the challenges in hardware and currency headwinds. However, the company's strong growth in software and services, along with its strategic investments and return to shareholders, suggests long-term potential. The stock is expected to be impacted by the company's ability to manage these challenges and deliver on its 2014 and 2015 objectives.
