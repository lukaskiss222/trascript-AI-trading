IBM's Q4 earnings call presented a mixed picture: while operating earnings per share increased by 3.5% and management expressed confidence about entering 2017 stronger, the slight revenue decline of 0.7% and acknowledgment of tax headwinds may temper investor enthusiasm. The company's guidance of at least $13.80 EPS for 2017 suggests modest growth expectations. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral.
