IBM reported strong Q3 results, exceeding expectations with a 15% increase in EPS (excluding one-time items) and robust growth in software and hardware segments, particularly in mainframes and middleware. Despite some concerns over lower long-term services signings, management's optimism and reaffirmed guidance suggest confidence in future performance. The positive earnings surprise and strong financials are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
