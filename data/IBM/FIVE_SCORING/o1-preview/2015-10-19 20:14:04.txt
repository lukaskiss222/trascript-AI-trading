IBM's earnings call highlighted some short-term challenges, including a 1% decline in revenue and a 3% drop in software revenue. The company lowered its full-year EPS guidance, citing slower-than-expected transformation in its Global Business Services and weaker software transactions at the end of the quarter. While strategic imperatives showed strong growth, these issues may weigh on investor sentiment, likely causing a negative impact on the stock price in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
