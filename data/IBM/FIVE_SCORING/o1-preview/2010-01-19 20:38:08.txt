IBM's earnings call highlighted strong profit growth, margin expansion, and an optimistic outlook for 2010, including an EPS target of at least $11. Despite modest revenue growth, management's focus on higher-margin businesses, successful cost-cutting initiatives, and expectations of improved performance in software and services are likely to boost investor confidence. The positive guidance and strong execution should have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
