IBM's Q3 earnings showed a 2% revenue decline due to a stronger dollar, with flat revenue at constant currency. While the company maintained its full-year EPS guidance and emphasized growth in strategic areas like cloud and AI, there were challenges in the Cognitive Solutions segment and a decrease in certain revenues. The mixed results and management's acknowledgement of headwinds may lead to a slight negative impact on the stock in the short term.
