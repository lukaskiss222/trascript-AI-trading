IBM reported strong quarterly results with 8% revenue growth, 21% EPS growth, and increased full-year EPS guidance. The company showed robust performance across key segments and growth initiatives, and management's positive tone reflects confidence in ongoing momentum. Despite some concerns over services signings and public sector weakness, the strong results and raised guidance are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock.
