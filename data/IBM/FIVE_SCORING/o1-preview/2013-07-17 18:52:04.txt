IBM's earnings call presented a mixed outlook. The company reported solid growth in its high-margin software and services segments and raised its operating EPS guidance excluding the rebalancing charge. However, the reduction in all-in EPS guidance due to a delayed divestiture, ongoing weakness in hardware sales, and currency headwinds suggest potential short-term challenges. These factors may lead to negative sentiment impacting the stock price in the near term.
