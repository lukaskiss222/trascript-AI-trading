IBM's fourth quarter earnings show a return to revenue growth after a period of decline, driven by strong performance in strategic areas like cloud and security. While this is positive, concerns remain about margin pressures, higher tax rates affecting 2018 EPS, and lower free cash flow guidance. Overall, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the renewed growth momentum.
