IBM's earnings call highlighted a significant miss in expectations, a reduction in full-year guidance, and the abandonment of its 2015 EPS target of $20. Weakness in key segments like software and services, combined with currency headwinds and a slowdown in September, indicates substantial short-term challenges. These factors are likely to exert strong downward pressure on the stock price in the immediate future.
