IBM exceeded expectations in its Q2 2024 earnings by delivering strong revenue growth, profitability, and cash-flow generation, especially from its Software and Infrastructure segments. The positive short-term impact is reinforced by the raised free cash flow guidance and the substantial progress in AI and cloud strategies. However, there is some pressure in the Consulting segment due to macroeconomic factors affecting discretionary spending. Despite this, IBM's strategic advancements and raised guidance suggest a positive outlook for the stock in the short term.
