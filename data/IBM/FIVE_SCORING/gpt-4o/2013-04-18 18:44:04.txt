The IBM earnings transcript indicates a mixed quarter. Financially, the company sees a shortfall due to delayed software and mainframe deals, which they expect to close in the next quarter. This indicates potential for a recovery in Q2 performance. However, operating expense management, strong service bookings, and growth in areas like Smarter Planet and cloud suggest resilience. Management remains confident in achieving annual EPS targets despite challenges, but the near-term outlook suggests pressure on the stock due to current uncertainties and significant restructuring charges expected in Q2.
