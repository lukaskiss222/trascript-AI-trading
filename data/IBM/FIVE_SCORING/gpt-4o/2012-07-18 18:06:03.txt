IBM's earnings call reflects a solid financial performance, with key positives including a 14% increase in operating EPS and a record $18 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. The company showed strength across various markets, particularly in growth markets like China and Russia, where software revenue was up double digits. Despite a strong dollar impacting revenue growth by about $1 billion, IBM increased its full-year EPS guidance, signaling confidence in ongoing performance. The company's focus on productivity, margin expansion, and growth in strategic areas such as cloud and analytics could buoy investor sentiment in the short term.
