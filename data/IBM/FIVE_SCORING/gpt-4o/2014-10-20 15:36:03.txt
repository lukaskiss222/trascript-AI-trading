IBM's earnings call reveals significant challenges and strategic shifts. The company's third-quarter results were below expectations, largely due to weaker software revenues, inadequate productivity in services, and a negative currency impact. Notably, IBM's divestiture of its semiconductor manufacturing business marks a bold move to focus on high-value strategic areas like cloud and data analytics. While the company continues to manage expectations downward, with 2015 EPS targets no longer feasible, these strategic adjustments may yield long-term benefits. However, given the immediate financial underperformance and headwinds, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure.
