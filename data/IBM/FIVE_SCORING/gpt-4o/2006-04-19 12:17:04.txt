IBM's Q1 results exhibited strong earnings performance with EPS up 27% year-over-year and solid cash generation, despite a reported 10% revenue decline largely due to the divestiture of its PC business. The company demonstrated robust service and software growth, particularly in key middleware products like WebSphere and Tivoli. However, challenges remain in hardware margins and Asia-Pacific performance, particularly Japan. Given these mixed signals but fairly positive short-term guidance and sentiment from management, the stock is likely to remain stable or see a slight uptick in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
