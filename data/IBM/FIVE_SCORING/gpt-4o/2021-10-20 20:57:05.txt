IBM's Q3 2021 earnings call reveals a mix of strategic progress and short-term challenges. While the company sees growth in key areas like hybrid cloud and AI, and benefits from strong software revenues, revenue grew only 2% when excluding Kyndryl. Management acknowledges the disruption due to the Kyndryl separation and hardware segment challenges. Despite positive long-term prospects with strategic focus post-separation, these uncertainties and modest revenue growth may pressure the stock in the short term, particularly in the face of increasing complexity in transition phases, prompting a cautious market reaction.
