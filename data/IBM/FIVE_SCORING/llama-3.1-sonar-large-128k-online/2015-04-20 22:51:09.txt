IBM's first-quarter earnings call presented several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Strong Strategic Imperatives Growth**: IBM saw significant growth in its strategic imperatives, such as cloud, analytics, and mobile, with a 30% increase in these areas. However, management clarified that this rate is not expected to sustain at 30% but rather return to the historical 19-20% growth rate.

2. **Currency Impact**: The stronger dollar had a substantial impact on revenue and profit, with an estimated $0.15 to $0.20 per share impact in the quarter. This could continue to affect earnings if currency rates remain unfavorable.

3. **Hardware Performance**: The mainframe business saw a significant boost, with revenue more than doubling, driven by the new z13 mainframe. This performance is expected to continue, although with some seasonal and comparative challenges in the second quarter.

4. **Services Segment**: While services revenue was down, the segment showed signs of improvement, particularly in cloud and strategic imperatives. However, FX and the shift away from lower-margin services impacted profitability.

5. **Free Cash Flow and Guidance**: IBM expects flat free cash flow for the year, with positive factors like lower cash taxes offset by increased CapEx and performance-related payments. Guidance for operating EPS remains at $15.75 to $16.50 for the full year.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for IBM's stock is likely neutral to slightly positive. The strong growth in strategic imperatives and hardware, combined with the company's ongoing transformation and investment in high-value areas, are positive indicators. However, the significant currency impact and some challenges in the services segment may temper immediate upside.
