IBM's first-quarter 2019 earnings call presented several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Revenue and Growth**: While overall revenue was down 4.7% due to currency headwinds, IBM saw growth in high-value areas such as cloud, cognitive software, and consulting. Cloud revenue accelerated to 12% at constant currency, and consulting revenue was up 9%[3].

2. **Margin Expansion**: The company reported significant margin expansion, with operating gross margins up 90 basis points and operating pretax margins up 320 basis points. This was driven by strong performance in services businesses and operational efficiencies[3].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: IBM maintained its full-year expectations for operating earnings per share and free cash flow, despite some challenges in emerging markets and the impact of the IBM Z product cycle. The company is confident in its ability to absorb headwinds and meet its full-year expectations[3].

4. **Red Hat Acquisition**: The upcoming acquisition of Red Hat is expected to enhance IBM's position in the hybrid cloud market, but its financial implications are not included in the current guidance until the deal closes in the second half of 2019[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term:

- Strong performance in high-value segments and margin expansion are positive indicators.
- Maintained guidance and confidence in meeting full-year expectations suggest stability.
- The Red Hat acquisition, although not yet included in guidance, is expected to be a strategic boost.

However, minor headwinds from currency and emerging market performance might slightly temper the immediate positive impact.
