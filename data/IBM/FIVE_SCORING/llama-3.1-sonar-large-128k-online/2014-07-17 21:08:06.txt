The earnings transcript for IBM reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

## Positive Factors:
- IBM reported stable revenue performance, with double-digit growth in strategic areas like cloud, AI, and mobile, which are crucial for the company's long-term strategy.
- The company saw improvements in profit margins, with a 10 basis point increase in gross margin and significant increases in pre-tax and net margins.
- Strong cash generation was noted, with $3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter, and expectations to generate at least $16 billion for the year.
- Investments in cloud, Watson, and chip innovation are positioned to drive future growth and maintain IBM's leadership in high-performance systems.

## Neutral to Negative Factors:
- The overall revenue was down 2% or 1% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of the customer care business.
- Services revenue was flat, and signings were the lowest in over six years, indicating potential secular pressures in core franchises.
- Hardware revenue, particularly in Power and System x, showed significant declines, though mainframe performance was strong.
- The company faces ongoing challenges in certain regions, such as Asia-Pacific outside of Japan, and secular shifts in hardware business segments.

## Management's Tone and Guidance:
- Management remains optimistic about the second half, expecting Software revenue growth to accelerate to mid-single digits and Services profit growth driven by productivity improvements.
- The guidance for operating earnings per share of at least $18 for 2014 and $20 for 2015 suggests confidence in long-term performance.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact. The strong performance in strategic areas and improved profit margins are positive indicators, but the challenges in core franchises and regional performance may temper immediate gains.
