IBM's Q1 2021 earnings call presented several positive and some cautionary notes that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

### Positive Factors
- **Revenue Growth and Cloud Performance**: IBM reported a 1% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong performance in Cloud & Cognitive Software and Systems segments. Cloud revenue was up 18% for the quarter and over $26 billion for the last 12 months, indicating robust adoption of IBM's hybrid cloud platform[1][3][4].
- **Margin Expansion and Free Cash Flow**: The company saw an expansion in gross profit margins and a significant increase in adjusted free cash flow, which is a key indicator of financial health and investment potential[1][3][4].
- **Investments and Strategic Initiatives**: IBM is investing heavily in AI, cloud, and ecosystem partnerships, which are expected to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth in the future. The go-to-market changes and acquisitions are also positioned to contribute positively[1][3][4].

### Cautionary Notes
- **Mainframe Cycle and Seasonality**: While the mainframe cycle performed exceptionally well, there is caution about counting on continued acceleration, which might affect second-quarter expectations. Normal seasonality might not fully materialize due to this factor[1][3][4].
- ** signings and Backlog**: Although GBS showed improved growth, signings were down due to tough comparisons from large deals in the previous year. There is some pause in pipeline builds due to the upcoming spin of the managed infrastructure services business[1][3][4].
- **Geographical and Industry Variations**: The spend environment varies by geography and industry, with some regions and sectors showing caution, which could impact overall growth[1][3][4].

### Conclusion
Given these factors, IBM's stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The strong cloud performance, margin expansion, and robust free cash flow generation are positive indicators. However, the cautious notes on mainframe cycle continuity and some pipeline pauses might temper immediate expectations.
