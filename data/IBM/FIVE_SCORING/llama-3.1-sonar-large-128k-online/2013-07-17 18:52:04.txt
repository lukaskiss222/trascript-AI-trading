The earnings transcript for IBM indicates several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Indicators
- IBM reported strong performance in high-margin businesses, including software and System Z mainframes, with software revenue up 4% year-to-year and System Z revenue growing 11% at constant currency.
- The company saw a return to growth in Global Business Services (GBS) and strong backlog growth in services, up 7% at constant currency, which is the best in four years.
- IBM's growth initiatives, such as Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, and Cloud, showed significant growth, with cloud up over 70% in the first half of the year.
- The company announced the acquisition of SoftLayer, enhancing its cloud capabilities, which is seen as a positive strategic move.

## Challenges and Headwinds
- The revenue growth was impacted by currency fluctuations, particularly the devaluation of the yen, which affected IBM's profitability in Japan.
- Hardware performance was mixed, with Power and Storage revenues continuing to decline, although at a slower rate than in the previous quarter.
- The $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge affected the current quarter's earnings, although it is expected to yield benefits in the second half of the year.

## Guidance and Outlook
- IBM increased its full-year operating EPS guidance, excluding the workforce rebalancing charge, to at least $16.90, which is a positive signal for investors.
- The company remains confident in achieving its 2015 objective of at least $20 in operating EPS on an all-in basis.

Given these points, the overall impression is that while IBM faces some short-term challenges, particularly with currency and hardware segments, the strong performance in software, services, and growth initiatives, along with improved guidance, suggests a positive outlook.
