IBM's Q1 earnings transcript reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Strategic Imperatives Growth**: IBM reported 17% growth in strategic imperatives, which now represent 37% of total revenue. This growth, particularly in cloud, analytics, mobile, and security, is a positive indicator[4].

2. **Revenue and Profit Impact**: Despite the strong growth in strategic areas, total revenue was down 2% at constant currency, and profit was impacted by significant workforce transformation charges and currency effects. However, the company expects these actions to improve their long-term position[4].

3. **Acquisitions and Investments**: IBM made several significant acquisitions and investments, such as The Weather Company and Truven, which will contribute to revenue but are expected to be a drag on profit in the short term. These investments are seen as positive for long-term growth[4].

4. **Guidance and Expectations**: The company maintained its full-year guidance of at least $13.50 in operating earnings per share and expects improved free cash flow. However, Q2 earnings are expected to be lower than consensus due to the impact of restructuring charges and acquisition integrations[4].

Given these points, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the mixed results, particularly the revenue decline and profit impact from restructuring charges. However, the strong growth in strategic imperatives and significant investments in future growth areas are positive long-term indicators.

**Rating: -1**

This rating reflects the potential short-term negativity from the revenue decline and profit impact, but acknowledges the long-term potential from strategic investments and growth in key areas.
