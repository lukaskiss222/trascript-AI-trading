IBM's third-quarter earnings call presented several key points that are relevant for assessing the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Margin Performance**: Despite a challenging economic environment, IBM achieved strong margin performance, driven by its services and software segments. This included a 2-point expansion in gross margin and a 1.8-point expansion in pre-tax margin, which are significant positives.

2. **Revenue Growth and Geographic Performance**: IBM reported a 5% increase in revenue, with strong growth in emerging markets (13% at reported rates and 10% at constant currency). However, there were some slowdowns in major markets, particularly in China due to the Olympics.

3. **Cost Management and Efficiency**: The company has been aggressively managing costs and improving efficiency, which has contributed to its strong profit performance. This includes significant reductions in spending and improvements in operational efficiency, particularly in Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.

4. **Services and Software Strength**: The services segments showed robust performance, with high margin expansion and strong signings, particularly in short-term deals. Software revenue also grew 12% year-over-year, driven by acquisitions and strong demand for products that improve operational efficiency.

5. **Hardware Challenges**: While the overall hardware segment faced challenges, especially in industry-standard servers, high-end systems like System z and System p performed well. The company expects some improvement in the X86 server business in the fourth quarter and into 2009.

6. **Liquidity and Financial Health**: IBM demonstrated a strong liquidity position with nearly $10 billion in cash, a $10 billion backup credit facility, and successful access to term debt markets. This reduces concerns about funding and provides flexibility.

7. **Guidance and Confidence**: The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance of at least $8.75 EPS, driven by confidence in its operational plan, margin performance, and the quality of its services contracts. However, there are concerns about the economic environment and potential impacts on transactional business.

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting IBM's ability to manage through a tough economic environment with strong operational efficiency, margin performance, and a solid financial position. However, there are some cautionary notes regarding the hardware segment and the broader economic challenges.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to IBM's strong margin performance, efficient cost management, and robust services and software growth. While there are challenges in the hardware segment and economic uncertainties, the company's solid financial health and confident guidance mitigate these concerns.
