The earnings transcript for IBM reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Profit Performance**: IBM reported revenue that was essentially flat when excluding the impact of currency and divestitures. The company saw strong growth in strategic imperatives, such as cloud, analytics, and security, but faced headwinds in software revenue and geographic regions like the BRIC countries[5].

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: Despite challenges, IBM maintained its full-year EPS guidance and slightly improved its free cash flow outlook. However, the impact of currency is expected to be more significant than previously anticipated, which could affect earnings[5].

3. **Investments and Transformation**: The company is heavily investing in strategic imperatives, which are showing strong growth. However, these investments are currently impacting profit margins, and management emphasized that these investments are crucial for long-term growth[5].

4. **Segment Performance**: The services segment saw mixed results, with growth in some areas like cloud and security but declines in traditional ERP implementations. The software segment faced challenges, particularly due to the impact of currency and shifts towards SaaS models[5].

5. **Cash Flow and Margin Improvement**: IBM generated strong free cash flow and improved margins through portfolio actions, despite ongoing investments. However, the services segment's profitability was affected by currency translation and workforce rebalancing[5].

Given these points:

- The strong performance in strategic imperatives and the company's ability to maintain EPS guidance are positive factors.
- However, the ongoing impact of currency, the decline in software revenue, and the mixed performance in services segments could create short-term uncertainty.

Overall, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative impact in the short term due to these mixed signals.
