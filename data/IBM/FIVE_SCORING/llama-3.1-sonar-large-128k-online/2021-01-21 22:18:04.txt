The transcript of IBM's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: IBM reported a revenue decline of 6% year-over-year, with significant headwinds in the software segment due to the wrap on peak Enterprise License Agreements (ELAs) from the previous year and clients opting for shorter-duration engagements amid economic uncertainty. Despite this, the company maintained strong free cash flow and expanded gross profit margins[5,.

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: IBM expressed confidence in revenue growth for 2021, driven by Red Hat's strong performance, the return of Global Business Services (GBS) to pre-pandemic growth rates, and the absence of product cycle dynamics as a headwind in 2022. However, the first half of 2021 is expected to be impacted by the shift to shorter-duration software transactions and IBM Z product cycle dynamics[5,.

3. **Structural Actions and Spin-Off**: The company took significant structural actions to simplify and optimize its operating model, which included a $2.04 billion pre-tax charge. The spin-off of the Managed Infrastructure Services business (NewCo) is progressing, with a focus on improving the financial profile of both IBM and NewCo[5,.

4. **Client Feedback and Market Position**: Despite some client caution due to the spin-off, IBM reported positive client feedback and strong renewal rates, indicating confidence in the long-term value proposition of both IBM and NewCo[5,.

Given these points:

- The immediate reaction to the earnings report might be negative due to the revenue decline and the one-time charges.
- However, the long-term outlook, strong free cash flow, and confidence in revenue growth could mitigate this negativity over the short term (1-2 weeks).

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the revenue decline and one-time charges but may stabilize or recover as investors focus on the company's robust free cash flow, improving gross margins, and the positive long-term outlook.
