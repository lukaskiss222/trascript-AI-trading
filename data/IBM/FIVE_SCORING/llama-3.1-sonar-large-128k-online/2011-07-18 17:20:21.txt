IBM's second-quarter earnings call presented several positive indicators that suggest a strong short-term outlook for the company's stock. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: IBM reported a 12% revenue growth and an 18% increase in operating earnings per share, which is a significant improvement year-over-year. This performance has led to an increase in the full-year 2011 earnings per share expectation to at least $13.25.
- **Strong Performance in Growth Initiatives**: The company saw robust growth in its key initiatives, including business analytics (up over 20%), cloud computing (cloud revenue already exceeding full-year 2010 results), and Smarter Planet solutions (up over 50%).
- **Global Expansion and Market Share Gains**: IBM continued to gain market share, particularly in growth markets, with revenue up 13% at constant currency. The company also reported significant competitive displacements, especially in the UNIX segment, and strong performance in mainframes and other system brands.
- **Financial Health**: IBM generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and returned nearly $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's balance sheet remains strong with a cash balance of $11.8 billion and manageable debt levels.
- **Positive Outlook and Guidance**: The management expressed confidence in the company's long-term roadmap, aiming for at least $20 in EPS by 2015. The current performance and momentum suggest they are on track to meet these objectives.

Given these strong financial results, positive growth in key segments, and the company's confident outlook, it is likely that IBM's stock will see a positive impact in the short term.
