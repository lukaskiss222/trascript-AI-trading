IBM's fourth-quarter earnings call presents a mixed picture but with several positive indicators for the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Growth**: IBM reported revenue of $22.1 billion, down 2% but with strong growth in strategic imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security) which now represent 35% of IBM's revenue. This segment grew 26% for the year, indicating a successful transformation towards higher-value areas[3].

- **Margin and Profit**: Despite a decline in overall revenue, IBM maintained strong profit margins, with operating earnings per share of $4.84. The company also saw improvements in gross and pre-tax income margins, driven by portfolio actions and investments in high-value areas[3].

- **Cash Flow and Investments**: IBM generated strong free cash flow of $13.1 billion for the year, driven by lower cash tax payments and improvements in working capital. The company continued to invest heavily in R&D, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, positioning itself for future growth[3].

- **Guidance and Outlook**: For 2016, IBM expects continued growth in strategic imperatives, modest expansion in gross margin, and free cash flow in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion. The company anticipates an impact from currency on pre-tax profit growth but remains confident in its strategy and ability to execute[3].

Given these points, here is the short-term impact on the stock:

- The strong performance in strategic imperatives, continued margin expansion, and robust cash generation are positive indicators.
- However, the ongoing impact of currency on revenue and profit, as well as the mixed performance in some segments, could introduce some volatility.

**Conclusion**:
The overall positive trends in strategic growth areas, improved margins, and strong cash flow suggest a generally positive outlook, although currency headwinds may introduce some short-term volatility.

**Rating**: 1
