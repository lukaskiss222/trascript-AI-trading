IBM's first-quarter earnings call for 2009 presented several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock.

- **Strong Margin Performance**: IBM reported significant margin expansion, driven by improvements in services and software segments, and a shift towards higher-value businesses. This margin strength is expected to continue, supporting the company's EPS guidance of at least $9.20 for the year.
- **Robust Cash Flow and Financial Position**: IBM generated $1 billion in free cash flow, reduced debt by $3 billion, and returned nearly $2.5 billion to shareholders. This strong cash position and cash flow performance provide flexibility for future investments and share repurchases.
- **Growth in Strategic Areas**: The company saw strong growth in its services signings, particularly in strategic outsourcing, and in growth markets such as India and China. Initiatives like Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, and Cloud Computing are also positioned for future growth.
- **Operational Efficiency**: IBM has implemented various cost-saving and productivity initiatives, which are expected to yield significant benefits throughout the year. The bulk of the restructuring activities are behind them, with the benefits primarily ahead.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, indicating that IBM is well-positioned to navigate the current economic environment and deliver strong financial performance.
