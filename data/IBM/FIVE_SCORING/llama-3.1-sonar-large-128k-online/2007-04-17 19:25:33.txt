IBM's first-quarter earnings transcript indicates a mixed but generally positive performance, which is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

## Strong Global Performance
IBM reported a 7% revenue increase as reported and 4% at constant currency, driven by strong performances in Asia-Pacific and Europe, which offset the weaker results in the U.S..

## Margin Improvement
The company expanded its gross profit margin for the 11th consecutive quarter, driven by an improving business mix and productivity initiatives. This suggests continued operational efficiency and strategic success.

## Services and Software Growth
Global Business Services and Global Technology Services showed solid growth, with GBS delivering particularly strong results. Software revenue also grew 9% year-to-year, led by double-digit growth in strategic branded middleware products.

## Challenges in U.S. and Hardware
While the U.S. market was weaker, especially in the enterprise sector, IBM expects improvement in the second quarter. The hardware segment had mixed results, with strong performance in System z and System p, but weakness in System i and storage.

## Financial Objectives
IBM reaffirmed its long-term earnings per share growth objective of 10% to 12%, with expectations for 2007 earnings per share growth to be around 11%, potentially closer to 12% including the gain from the divestiture of the printer business.

Given these points, the overall tone of the transcript is positive, with IBM demonstrating resilience and growth in key areas despite some regional and segment-specific challenges.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to IBM's strong global performance, margin improvements, and growth in services and software.
