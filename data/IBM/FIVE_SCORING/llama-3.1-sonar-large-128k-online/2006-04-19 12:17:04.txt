IBM's Q1 2008 earnings transcript indicates several positive and some mixed trends that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks).

### Positive Trends:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: IBM reported a 21% increase in pre-tax income and a 27% increase in EPS year-over-year, driven by solid revenue growth, especially in services and software[2][4].
- **Cash and Balance Sheet Strength**: The company demonstrated strong cash generation, ending the quarter with $12.3 billion in cash and low non-financing debt levels. This financial strength positions IBM well for future investments and shareholder returns[2][4].
- **Growth in Emerging Markets**: Significant growth in emerging countries like India, China, Brazil, and Russia, with India showing a 61% year-over-year growth, indicates a strong expansion strategy[2].
- **Software Performance**: Key middleware products, such as WebSphere and Tivoli, saw double-digit growth, reflecting strong demand for services-oriented architectures and systems management solutions[2].

### Mixed and Cautionary Trends:
- **Hardware Margins**: While hardware revenue was mixed, with strong performances in microelectronics and System X servers, there were declines in other server brands due to product transitions and mix shifts. This could impact short-term margins[2].
- **Retirement-Related Expenses**: Despite a reduction in estimated retirement-related expenses, this remains a significant year-over-year headwind[2].
- **Asia-Pacific Performance**: While there was modest improvement, the region, particularly Japan, continues to be a drag on overall performance. Improvement is expected but not immediate[2].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance, robust cash generation, and positive trends in services and software, the short-term impact on IBM's stock is likely to be positive. However, the mixed signals from hardware and the ongoing challenges in Asia-Pacific might temper the enthusiasm slightly.
