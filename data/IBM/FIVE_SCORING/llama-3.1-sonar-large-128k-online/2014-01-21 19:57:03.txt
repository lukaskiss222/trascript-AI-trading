The earnings transcript for IBM highlights several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Mixed Performance**: IBM reported a strong quarter in software and services, but hardware performance was weak due to the mainframe product cycle and other business model issues. This mixed performance might lead to cautious investor sentiment[3].

2. **Guidance and EPS Expectations**: IBM provided guidance for 2014 with an expectation of at least $18 in operating EPS, which is a 10.5% increase from 2013. However, the first quarter is expected to be weak due to restructuring charges, which could affect short-term investor confidence[3].

3. **Cash Flow and Financial Flexibility**: Despite a challenging year in cash flow, IBM expects to improve free cash flow in 2014 by about $1 billion. The company also maintains a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility for acquisitions and share repurchases[3].

4. **Challenges in Growth Markets**: IBM continues to face challenges in growth markets, particularly in China, which could impact short-term revenue growth. However, the company is optimistic about long-term opportunities in these markets[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility due to the mixed performance, particularly the weak hardware segment and the challenging first quarter. However, the strong software and services performance, along with positive long-term outlook and financial flexibility, may mitigate some of the negative impact.
