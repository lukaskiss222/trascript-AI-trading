The earnings transcript for IBM's Q3 2021 reveals several key points that will likely influence the stock's performance in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Growth**: IBM reported modest revenue growth, but it fell short of expectations in some areas, particularly in hardware and certain software segments. However, the company saw strong growth in Red Hat, security, automation, and cloud services, which are key drivers of future growth[3,.

2. **Kyndryl Separation**: The upcoming separation of Kyndryl is expected to cause a short-term pause in client spending, particularly in hardware and managed infrastructure services. However, IBM is confident that this pause will be temporary and will not have long-term systemic issues[3,.

3. **Cost and Margin Pressure**: IBM is investing heavily in skills, innovation, and its ecosystem, which is currently putting pressure on margins, especially in the Global Business Services segment. However, the company expects these investments to pay off in the future[3,.

4. **Free Cash Flow and Financial Health**: IBM generated solid free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet, which will support future investments and provide attractive shareholder returns[3,.

Given these points, the short-term impact on IBM's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the short-term disruptions and margin pressure associated with the Kyndryl separation and the ongoing investments. However, the company's strong cash generation, strategic growth initiatives, and confidence in achieving midterm objectives suggest that the long-term outlook remains positive.
