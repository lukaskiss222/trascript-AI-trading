The earnings transcript for IBM reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Revenue and Profitability**: IBM reported a 4% decline in revenue, largely due to currency impacts and significant declines in hardware sales, particularly in growth markets like China. However, the company maintained strong profit margins and delivered a 10% increase in operating EPS, helped by tax benefits and share repurchase programs[3,.

2. **Growth Markets and China**: The company faced significant challenges in growth markets, particularly China, where revenue was down 22% and hardware sales plummeted by 40%. This is attributed to the ongoing economic reform plans in China, which are expected to impact demand until after the first quarter of 2014. However, IBM is confident in returning to mid-single-digit growth in these markets once the economic plans are announced[3].

3. **Services and Software**: Despite some execution issues, the services segment showed improvement, with Global Business Services (GBS) revenue growing 5% at constant currency. Software revenue was up 1% at constant currency, though below expectations, with a strong pipeline expected for the fourth quarter[3].

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: IBM is maintaining its full-year 2013 EPS guidance of at least $16.25 and remains confident in achieving its 2015 EPS target of at least $20. The company expects to stabilize hardware profitability and return growth markets to mid-single-digit growth in 2014[3].

Given these points:

- The short-term impact on the stock is likely to be negative due to the revenue decline, significant challenges in growth markets, and the ongoing impact of currency fluctuations.
- However, the company's strong profit margins, optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, and long-term growth strategies may mitigate some of the negative sentiment.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the revenue decline and challenges in growth markets, but the overall financial health and long-term outlook may prevent a significant drop.
