IBM's Q2 2023 earnings call painted a generally positive picture, despite some challenges. Here are the key points influencing the short-term stock price impact:

1. **Revenue and Profit Growth**: IBM reported 2% constant currency revenue growth, which is the company's best in seven years. Operating pretax income grew 11%, and earnings per share increased by 5% despite significant tax headwinds[3}.
2. **Segment Performance**: Strong growth in software and consulting segments, with cloud revenue up 20% and security revenue up 80%. However, Cognitive Solutions revenue was down 1% at constant currency, and infrastructure revenue declined 15%[3].
3. **Margin Expansion**: Gross profit margin expanded by 140 basis points, driven by improving portfolio mix and productivity initiatives. Services gross margins are expected to expand in the second half[3].
4. **Currency Impact**: The U.S. dollar appreciation created a headwind, but IBM's hedging programs mitigate this impact on profit levels. However, currency fluctuations will continue to affect top-line revenue and gross margins[3].
5. **Guidance and Outlook**: IBM remains confident in its full-year guidance, expecting at least $13.80 in operating earnings per share and $12 billion in free cash flow. The company is optimistic about its strategic imperatives, particularly cloud and AI[3].

Given these points:

- The strong revenue and profit growth, along with the expansion of gross profit margins, are positive indicators.
- The challenges in Cognitive Solutions and the impact of currency fluctuations are manageable and being addressed through hedging and operational efficiencies.
- The overall optimism and confidence in meeting full-year guidance are supportive of the stock.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report, solid revenue and profit growth, and the company's confidence in its future outlook.
