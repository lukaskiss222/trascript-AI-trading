The earnings transcript for Kenexa Corporation reveals several key points that indicate a challenging short-term outlook but a strong long-term position.

### Key Points:
- **Revenue and Guidance**: Kenexa's fourth-quarter revenue was $45.1 million, down 6% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The company expects revenue in the range of $38 to $41 million for the first quarter of 2009, with non-GAAP operating margins targeted between 12% to 14% in the middle case scenario.
- **Economic Impact**: The macroeconomic environment significantly impacted the company, particularly in the RPO (Recruitment Process Outsourcing) segment, where 80% of clients are operating at or below minimum guaranteed levels. This segment is highly sensitive to hiring trends and economic conditions.
- **Cost Cutting and Efficiency**: Kenexa has implemented cost-cutting measures, including a workforce reduction of approximately 150 employees, to adjust to the lower revenue run rate. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong balance sheet and cash flow.
- **Market Position**: Kenexa's ATS (Applicant Tracking System) business remains robust, with a high renewal rate of over 90% and significant new customer additions. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on market consolidation and the need for efficient talent management solutions.
- **Future Outlook**: The company is cautious about the near-term outlook due to economic uncertainties but remains bullish about the long-term opportunities in the talent management market. Key indicators for a turn in the business include the credit market opening up and improvements in the conversion rate of verbal to signed contracts.

### Short-Term Impact on Stock Price:
Given the current economic challenges, reduced revenue, and significant goodwill impairment charge expected, the short-term outlook for Kenexa's stock is likely to be negative. The company's guidance and the ongoing economic uncertainties suggest that investors may react cautiously in the near term.
