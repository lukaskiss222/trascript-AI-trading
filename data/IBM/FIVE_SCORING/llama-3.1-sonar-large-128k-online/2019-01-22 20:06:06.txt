IBM's fourth-quarter earnings call presented several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: IBM delivered solid revenue, operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share for the year, despite some headwinds such as currency impacts and the wrap on the IBM Z product cycle.
2. **Operating Leverage and Margin Expansion**: The company expanded both gross and pre-tax operating margins, driven by strong performance in services and software, particularly in hybrid cloud, analytics, and AI offerings.
3. **Cloud and Strategic Imperatives Growth**: IBM's cloud revenue grew significantly, with an annual run rate for cloud-delivered-as-a-Service of over $12 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Strategic imperatives revenue was up 9% to about $40 billion.
4. **Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization**: IBM announced divestitures of lower-value businesses, which, while neutral to profit in 2019, will improve the revenue and margin profile in the long term.
5. **Red Hat Acquisition**: The pending acquisition of Red Hat is expected to accelerate hybrid cloud adoption and is seen positively by clients, though its financial impact is not included in 2019 guidance due to timing uncertainties.
6. **Guidance for 2019**: IBM expects operating earnings per share of at least $13.90 and free cash flow of about $12 billion, despite headwinds from currency, divestitures, and tax rates.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to:

- Strong financial performance and margin expansion
- Growth in high-value segments such as cloud and AI
- Positive client response to the Red Hat acquisition
- Continued commitment to shareholder returns through dividends and share buybacks

However, there are some minor headwinds like currency impacts and the wrap on the mainframe cycle, but these are largely managed within the company's guidance.
