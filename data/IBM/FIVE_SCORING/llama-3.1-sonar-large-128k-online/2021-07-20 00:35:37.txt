The IBM Q2 2021 earnings call presents several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Signals
- IBM reported a 3% revenue growth, driven by strong performances in Global Business Services and Cloud & Cognitive Software, which is a positive indicator of the company's strategy execution[5|.
- The company saw significant growth in cloud revenue, up 13% (9% adjusting for divested businesses and currency), and a strong increase in software revenues, up 6% (2% adjusting for currency)[1|.
- IBM's hybrid cloud strategy, particularly the integration of Red Hat, is showing promising results, with Cloud Paks maturity and adoption contributing to the growth[5|.
- The company maintained a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, with $8.2 billion in cash on hand and a reduction in debt[1|.
- Operational margins expanded, and gross profit dollars grew, contributing to improved cash performance[5].

### Mixed Signals
- While revenue growth was positive, the net income was down 10% year-over-year, and diluted earnings per share decreased by 11%[1|.
- There were investment-related pressures on margins in the Global Business Services and Cloud & Cognitive Software segments, which might impact short-term profitability[5|.
- Labor shortages and wage increases were noted as challenges, particularly in the services business[5|.
- Some segments, like Transaction Processing Platforms, saw declines, which could be due to macroeconomic and competitive pressures[5].

### Conclusion
Given the overall positive trends in revenue growth, cloud adoption, and the strategic execution of IBM's hybrid cloud and AI focus, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. However, the mixed signals around net income and margin pressures might temper some of the immediate enthusiasm.
