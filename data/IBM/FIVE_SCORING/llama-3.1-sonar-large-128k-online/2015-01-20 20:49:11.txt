The transcript of IBM's fourth-quarter earnings call for 2014 reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Profit Performance**: Despite a 12% revenue decline due to currency and divestitures, IBM's strategic imperatives showed strong growth, with cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security solutions growing 16%. However, the overall revenue growth was impacted by significant currency headwinds and divestitures.

2. **Guidance for 2015**: IBM expects flat revenue growth in 2015 due to ongoing currency impacts and the effects of divestitures. The company projected operating EPS in the range of $15.75 to $16.50, with flat free cash flow.

3. **Margin and Investment**: IBM is investing heavily in cloud, AI, and other strategic areas, which is expected to drive long-term growth but may impact short-term margins. The company anticipates continued margin expansion as these investments mature.

4. **Geographic Performance**: Mixed performance across different geographies, with Japan and China showing some stabilization, while other growth markets remain challenging.

5. **Cash Flow and Share Repurchase**: Free cash flow is expected to be flat, with reduced share repurchase activity compared to 2014. This could impact EPS growth.

Given these points, the immediate impact on IBM's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the flat revenue guidance, reduced share repurchase activity, and ongoing currency headwinds. However, the strong growth in strategic imperatives and long-term investment strategy may maintain investor confidence.
