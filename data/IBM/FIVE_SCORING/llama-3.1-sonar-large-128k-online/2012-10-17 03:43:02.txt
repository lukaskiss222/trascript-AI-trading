The earnings transcript for IBM indicates a mixed performance with some positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- IBM reported a 10% increase in operating EPS to $3.62, driven by margin expansion, productivity initiatives, and a gain from the divestiture of the Retail Store Solutions business[6}.
- The company saw strong growth in key initiatives such as Business Analytics, Cloud, and Smarter Planet, with double-digit revenue growth in these areas.
- IBM maintained its full-year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10 and remains on track for its 2015 target of $20 in operating EPS.
- The introduction of new products, including the zEnterprise EC12 mainframe and POWER7 plus servers, is expected to drive revenue and margin growth in the fourth quarter.

### Negative Factors:
- Revenue was down 5% year-over-year, including a 4-point currency headwind, and down 1% when normalized for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions.
- The third month of the quarter saw a decline in revenue growth rates, particularly in North America and some growth markets.
- Significant workforce rebalancing activities and higher tax rates impacted costs and net income.
- Some segments, such as System z and storage hardware, experienced declines in revenue.

### Conclusion:
Given the mixed performance, the short-term impact on IBM's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the revenue decline and challenging macroeconomic environment. However, the strong margin expansion, solid performance in key growth initiatives, and new product introductions provide a positive outlook for the future.
