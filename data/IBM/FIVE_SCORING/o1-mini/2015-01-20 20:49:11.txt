IBM reported strong growth in its strategic areas like cloud, analytics, and security, offset by challenges in traditional segments and significant currency headwinds. Management's focus on long-term growth initiatives and positive guidance for 2015 suggests confidence in overcoming short-term obstacles. These factors are likely to support a modest positive movement in IBM's stock over the next couple of weeks.
