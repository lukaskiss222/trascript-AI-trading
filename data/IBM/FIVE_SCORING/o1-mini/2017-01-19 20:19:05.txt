IBM reported a mixed Q4 performance with operating EPS increasing by 3.5%, driven by growth in strategic areas like cloud and cognitive solutions. While revenue declined slightly on a constant currency basis, management's optimistic guidance for 2017 and continued investments in growth sectors are likely to reassure investors. The overall sentiment suggests a modest positive impact on IBM's stock in the short term.
