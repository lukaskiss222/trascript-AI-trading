IBM reported a 2% decline in revenue but achieved a 14% increase in earnings per share, indicating strong profitability despite mixed performance across different segments. The robust software growth and ongoing cost-cutting measures may offset concerns from the services and hardware downturns, suggesting a balanced short-term outlook. Additionally, continued share buybacks and dividend increases support potential positive sentiment.
