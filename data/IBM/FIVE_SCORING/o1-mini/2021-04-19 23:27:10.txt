IBM reported a modest 1% revenue growth in Q1 2021, driven by strong performances in Cloud & Cognitive Software and Global Business Services. Management conveyed confidence in ongoing strategic initiatives and future growth prospects, which likely outweigh the slight revenue growth. The positive guidance and solid free cash flow support a short-term positive sentiment for the stock.
