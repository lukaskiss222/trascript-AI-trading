IBM delivered strong earnings with a 16% increase in EPS and a 5% revenue growth, driven by robust performance in software and services. The raised guidance to at least $11.20 EPS for the year and ongoing share repurchases indicate management's confidence in continued growth. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
