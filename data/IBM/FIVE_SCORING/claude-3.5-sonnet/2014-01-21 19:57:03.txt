Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on IBM's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerns include:

1. Significant hardware business challenges with profit down $750M in Q4 and $1.7B for the year, with no clear turnaround timeline presented.

2. Continued weakness in China with revenue down 23%, and management indicating recovery will take time.

3. Complex tax dynamics from normalized tax rate moving from below 23% to 23% creates earnings headwinds.

While management provided a path to their $18 EPS target for 2014, the near-term Q1 guidance of 14% of full year EPS (implying ~$2.50 vs consensus of $3.27) and planned restructuring charges will likely pressure the stock in the short term, despite longer-term strategic investments in areas like cloud and Watson.
