Based on the transcript fragments, IBM appears to be executing well on their strategic initiatives. Key positives include strong software business growth (from $2.4B to $11B), successful margin expansion through mix shift to higher-value offerings, and effective cost management through their $8B enterprise initiative. Management's confident tone about Power7 Plus cycle and their clear strategy for margin improvement through software mix and operational efficiency is encouraging. The focus on high-margin areas like Business Analytics, Smarter Planet, and Cloud computing, with their higher software content, suggests continued profit improvement.
