Based on the detailed earnings transcript, IBM delivered a strong quarter with several positive indicators:

- Revenue up 5% (4% constant currency) to $22.6B
- Strong software business performance with revenue up 9% 
- Exceptional System Z mainframe performance up 25%
- Pre-tax profit up 9% with solid 14% margins
- Management rolling through $0.10 EPS beat to full year estimates
- Strong cash flow and balance sheet position

However, there were some concerns around services signings being below expectations and increased operating expenses. Management expressed confidence in their long-term model and strategy.

Given the overall strong results, solid execution across key businesses, and management's confident outlook, I expect the stock to react positively in the near-term.
