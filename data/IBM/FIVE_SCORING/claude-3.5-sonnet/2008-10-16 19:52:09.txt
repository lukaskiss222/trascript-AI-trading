Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, I assess that IBM demonstrated resilience and strong execution despite challenging macro conditions. Key positives include:

1. Strong margin expansion driven by cost optimization and mix shift to higher-margin businesses
2. Solid services performance with highest margins in 6 years
3. Limited exposure to troubled financial institutions (~1% of revenue)
4. Strong liquidity position with $10B cash and access to credit markets
5. Management confidence in hitting full year guidance

However, there are some concerns:
- Hardware weakness, especially in x86 servers
- Currency headwinds emerging
- Some backlog deterioration
- Macro uncertainty impact on deal closings

Overall, given IBM's defensive business model with high recurring revenues, strong cost controls, and management's confident outlook for Q4, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction in the next 1-2 weeks.
