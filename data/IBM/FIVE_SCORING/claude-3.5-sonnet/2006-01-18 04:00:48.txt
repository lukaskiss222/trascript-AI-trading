Based on the earnings transcript, IBM showed mixed performance but with several positive indicators for near-term stock performance. Key positives include:

1. Strong performance in key growth areas like middleware software, microelectronics, and storage systems
2. Improved services margins driven by restructuring benefits and cost controls
3. Growth in strategic outsourcing signings and stable backlog
4. Management's confidence in growth acceleration through 2006
5. Healthy cash flow and continued share buybacks

Some concerns include currency headwinds and pension costs, but these appear manageable. Management's tone was generally optimistic about near-term prospects while acknowledging competitive pressures.

Given the solid execution in core businesses, margin improvements, and management's positive forward outlook despite some challenges, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction over the next 1-2 weeks.
