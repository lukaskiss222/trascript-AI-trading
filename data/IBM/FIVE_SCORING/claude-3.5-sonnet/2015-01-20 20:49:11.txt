Based on this earnings transcript, IBM is showing mixed signals but faces significant near-term headwinds. While the company is making strategic progress in cloud, analytics, and other growth initiatives ($25B in strategic imperatives revenue, growing 16%), they are guiding for lower 2015 EPS ($15.75-16.50 vs $16.53 in 2014) due to currency headwinds, restructuring costs, and continued business model transitions. The cautious guidance, currency impacts, and ongoing transformation challenges suggest the stock will likely face pressure in the next 1-2 weeks, despite some positive long-term strategic positioning.
