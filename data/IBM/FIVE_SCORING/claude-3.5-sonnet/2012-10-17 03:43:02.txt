Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on IBM's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's why:

Positives:
- Maintained full year EPS guidance of at least $15.10
- Strong performance in growth initiatives (Cloud, Analytics, Smarter Planet)
- Good margin expansion and cost control
- Solid backlog numbers, especially in growth markets

Negatives:
- Revenue miss and concerning slowdown in September
- Weakness in North America and traditional segments
- Services revenue growth challenges
- Macro uncertainty impacting customer spending
- Several large software deals pushed out of quarter

While IBM is executing well on its long-term strategy and cost management, the near-term revenue headwinds and uncertain macro environment will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the immediate term.
