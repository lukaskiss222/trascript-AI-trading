Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, IBM showed strong execution and resilience in a challenging environment. Key positives include:

1. Strong margin expansion and cost control, with pre-tax margin up 1.3 points
2. Services signings up 10% at constant currency
3. Software business remained stable with good recurring revenue
4. Management's increased confidence in achieving at least $9.20 EPS for 2009
5. Strong cash position ($12.3B) and continued focus on strategic investments

While revenue declined 11% as reported (-4% constant currency), the company's shift to higher-margin businesses and aggressive cost management should support near-term stock performance. Management's confident tone and clear strategic direction suggest the stock should perform well in the coming weeks.
