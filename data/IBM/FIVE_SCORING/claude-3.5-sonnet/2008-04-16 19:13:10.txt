Based on the earnings call transcript, IBM delivered a strong Q1 with broad-based growth across services, software, and key hardware segments. Key positives include:

1. Strong services performance with both GTS and GBS growing 17%
2. Successful z10 mainframe launch driving System z revenue up 10%
3. Robust growth in emerging markets 
4. Margin expansion across segments
5. Raised full year EPS guidance by $0.25 to $8.50

Management expressed confidence in their business model and strategy, particularly in:
- Focus on high-value offerings that deliver cost savings to clients
- Strong growth in emerging markets
- Solid pipeline in services
- Technology leadership with new products like z10 and POWER6

While there were some weaker areas (System x, OEM technology), these were lower-margin businesses with minimal profit impact. The company's overall execution, guidance raise, and management's confident tone suggest the stock should perform positively in the near term.
