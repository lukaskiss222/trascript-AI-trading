Based on the earnings transcript, I predict a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact on IBM's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

Positive factors:
- Strong software performance with 5% revenue growth and share gains in key middleware
- Maintained solid margins and profitability despite revenue challenges
- Reiterated full-year earnings guidance in line with expectations
- Strong cash flow and continued share buybacks

Negative factors:
- Services signings declined significantly (-34% YoY)
- Elongated sales cycles and some enterprise spending hesitation
- Supply chain issues impacted hardware deliveries
- Mixed performance across geographies

While there are some concerning trends in services bookings and enterprise spending, IBM's diverse portfolio, solid execution on margins, and maintained guidance suggest the market reaction should be relatively muted. The company appears to be navigating the challenges while continuing to deliver on profitability targets.
