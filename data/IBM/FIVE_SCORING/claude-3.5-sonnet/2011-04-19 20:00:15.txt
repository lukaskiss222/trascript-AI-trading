Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that IBM's stock is likely to have a positive short-term impact. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 8% with broad-based strength across segments
- Operating EPS grew 21% year-over-year to $2.41, beating expectations
- Management raised full-year EPS guidance by $0.15 to at least $13.15
- Strong performance in key growth initiatives (Cloud revenue up 5x, Analytics up 20%)
- Healthy margins with PTI and net income margins up 60 basis points

Minor Concerns:
- Services signings down 18% year-over-year at constant currency
- Some weakness in public sector business
- Potential Japan impact, though management indicates it's manageable

The overall tone was confident, with management highlighting strong execution and raising guidance. The breadth of strength across segments and geographies, combined with the guidance raise, suggests positive momentum that should translate to stock appreciation in the near-term.
