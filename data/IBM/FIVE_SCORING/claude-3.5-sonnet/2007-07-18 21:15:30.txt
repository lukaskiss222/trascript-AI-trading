Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, IBM demonstrated strong performance across multiple dimensions. Key positives include:

1. Broad-based revenue growth (9% reported, 6% constant currency) - strongest in 6 years
2. Strong services performance with signings up 22% and backlog growth
3. Software growth of 13% with key branded middleware growing at 2x market rate
4. Improved execution in Americas with US revenue up 6%
5. Strong cash flow generation with FCF up $1.7B year-over-year
6. Raised full year EPS guidance to 14-15% growth

The tone from management was very confident, highlighting operational improvements, market share gains, and positive momentum heading into H2. While there were some areas of weakness (microelectronics, storage), the overall business trends and execution appear quite strong.

Given the broad-based strength across geographies and business segments, improved guidance, and management's confident tone, I expect this earnings report to have a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
