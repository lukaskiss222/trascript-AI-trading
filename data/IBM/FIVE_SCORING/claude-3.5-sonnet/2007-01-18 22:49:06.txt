Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, I would make the following analysis for IBM's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positives:
- Very strong services signings at $17.8B, up 55% YoY
- Software revenue grew 14%, with key middleware up 25%
- Strong cash flow generation and $9.8B returned to shareholders
- Management confident in meeting 10% EPS growth target for 2007

Key Concerns:
- Margins pressured by acquisition integration costs
- Hardware growth mixed with some segments declining
- Higher expenses expected to continue in first half of 2007
- Pension costs increasing slightly in 2007

Overall, while there are some margin and expense headwinds in the near-term, IBM showed strong momentum in its key strategic areas of software and services. Management's confident outlook and emphasis on successful integration of acquisitions suggests the stock should perform reasonably well over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the generally solid results.
