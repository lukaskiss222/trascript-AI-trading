Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give IBM a positive short-term rating:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q1 performance with EPS up 27% YoY and revenue growth of 4% at constant currency
- Services signings improved with long-term up 20% and short-term up 5% 
- Software segment showed robust growth, particularly in key middleware products
- Management expressed confidence in meeting full year estimates
- Strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet

Some Concerns:
- Hardware margins faced pressure due to product mix and transitions
- Continued weakness in Japan/Asia-Pacific region
- Currency headwinds expected to impact revenue by 1-2% in Q2

Overall, while there are some near-term pressures in hardware and regional performance, the core services and software businesses are showing good momentum. Management's confident tone and solid Q1 execution suggest the stock should see positive momentum over the next 1-2 weeks.
