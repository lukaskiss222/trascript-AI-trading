Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of IBM's Q4 2010 performance and short-term outlook:

Key Positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 7% (best in a decade)
- Hardware revenue up 21% with growth across all platforms
- Software revenue up 11% (excluding PLM divestiture)
- Services signings up 18% to $22.1B
- Strong backlog at $142B
- Positive guidance for 2011 with EPS target of $13+

Key Points to Watch:
- Services revenue growth was modest at 2%
- Need to monitor integration of recent acquisitions
- Pension-related costs will create some headwinds

For the next 1-2 weeks, I expect a positive stock reaction given:
1. Strong beat on both revenue and earnings
2. Multiple signs of business momentum entering 2011
3. Confident management tone and raised guidance
4. Strong performance across all major segments

Rating: [2]
The combination of broad-based strength, raised guidance, and management's confident outlook suggests the stock should rally notably in the near term.
