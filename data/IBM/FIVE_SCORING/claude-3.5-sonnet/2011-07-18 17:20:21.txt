Based on the earnings call transcript, IBM demonstrated strong performance across multiple segments with positive indicators for short-term stock performance. Key highlights include:

1. Strong revenue growth of 12% with hardware and software both up 17%
2. Operating EPS growth of 18% and raised full-year guidance
3. Healthy services backlog at $144B, up $15B year-over-year
4. Strong growth in strategic initiatives (cloud, analytics, Smarter Planet)
5. Solid performance in growth markets, up 13% at constant currency
6. Margin pressure from workforce rebalancing appears temporary

Despite some minor concerns around services margins and currency impacts, the overall tone is very positive with management expressing confidence in both near-term outlook and long-term 2015 targets. The company's broad-based strength across segments and geographies suggests the stock should perform well in the following 1-2 weeks.
