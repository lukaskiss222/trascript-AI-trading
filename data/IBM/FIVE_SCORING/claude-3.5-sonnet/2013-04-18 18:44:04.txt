Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on IBM's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerning factors include:

1. Revenue miss and execution issues with delayed software/mainframe deals (~$400M) slipping into Q2
2. Disappointing growth market performance (only 1% growth)
3. Significant weakness in hardware business, particularly Power systems (-31%)
4. Major workforce restructuring/rebalancing planned for Q2 
5. Currency headwinds, especially from Yen depreciation impacting profits

While management maintained full-year EPS guidance of $16.70, the numerous operational challenges and planned restructuring suggest near-term pressure on the stock as investors digest these issues.
