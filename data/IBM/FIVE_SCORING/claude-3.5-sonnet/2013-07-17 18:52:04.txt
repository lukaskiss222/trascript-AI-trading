Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that IBM's stock is likely to have a positive short-term impact over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong software performance with 10% growth in key branded middleware and market share gains across all brands
2. Services backlog at a 4-year high (+7% constant currency), suggesting improved revenue growth ahead
3. Management raised full-year EPS guidance by $0.20 to $16.90 (excluding restructuring)
4. Cost savings from $1B workforce restructuring starting to materialize in Q3/Q4
5. Continued strong growth in strategic initiatives (Cloud +70%, Analytics +11%)

While there are some headwinds from currency and hardware weakness, the overall tone was confident about second half improvements and the raised guidance suggests momentum. The fundamentals point to near-term stock appreciation.
