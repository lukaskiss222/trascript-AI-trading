Based on this extensive earnings call transcript, I see several key positives and concerns for IBM's stock in the next 1-2 weeks:

Positives:
- Strong Q4 results with revenue up 10% and EPS up 24%
- Solid guidance for 2008 EPS of $8.20-8.30 
- Global reach providing growth buffer (65% of revenue outside US)
- Strong services signings and $118B backlog
- Healthy cash position ($16.1B) and plans for continued buybacks
- New product cycles in mainframes and POWER6 systems

Concerns:
- Economic uncertainty and potential IT spending slowdown
- Financial services exposure (28% of revenue) amid sector weakness
- Currency benefits masking slower organic growth
- Product transitions could impact near-term hardware sales
- Integration costs from pending acquisitions

Overall, while there are macro concerns, IBM appears well-positioned with its global reach, recurring revenue base, and operational execution. The strong Q4 results and constructive 2008 outlook should provide positive sentiment in the near-term.
