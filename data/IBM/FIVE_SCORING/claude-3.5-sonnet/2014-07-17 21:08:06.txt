Based on my analysis of IBM's Q2 earnings call transcript, here are the key points impacting the short-term stock outlook:

Positives:
- Strategic growth areas (cloud, analytics, mobile) showing strong performance with double-digit growth
- Mainframe business stabilizing, down only 1% YoY
- Company reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance of $18
- Continued strong margins and cost management

Negatives:
- Software growth was flat/weak, missing expectations for improvement
- Services signings down 33% in first half, lowest in 6 years
- Growth markets (ex-Japan) still challenged, especially Asia-Pacific
- Company faces ongoing secular challenges in hardware business

While IBM is making progress on strategic initiatives, the weakness in core software and services businesses is concerning for near-term performance. The company faces execution challenges as it transitions its business model.

Given the mixed signals but predominantly negative trends in key businesses, I expect modest downward pressure on the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
