Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on IBM's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong earnings beat and raised guidance: IBM increased full-year EPS guidance by $0.50 to "at least $9.70", demonstrating confidence in their outlook despite the tough environment.

2. Impressive margin expansion: Pre-tax margins improved by 4 points to 18.3%, the highest in 10 years for a non-Q4 quarter, driven by mix shift to higher-margin software/services and cost efficiency.

3. Cost savings upside: Management increased expected cost savings for 2009 from $3B to $3.5B, with $2B still to be realized in H2.

4. Strategic transformation progress: Software and services profits continue to grow double-digits, reducing reliance on hardware and improving overall business mix.

While revenue declined 7% constant currency, the company demonstrated strong execution on margins and costs, while providing an optimistic outlook for H2 improvement in hardware and services segments.

Rating: [1] Positive impact on stock price over next 1-2 weeks given the strong execution, raised guidance, and continued transformation progress.
