Based on reviewing this earnings transcript for IBM (actually Kenexa), several key points emerge:

1. The company is experiencing significant headwinds due to the deteriorating economic environment, with reduced guidance and challenges in their RPO (Recruitment Process Outsourcing) business.

2. However, their core ATS (Applicant Tracking System) business remains relatively strong with 90%+ renewal rates and record new customer wins in Q4.

3. Management outlined three scenarios for 2009:
- Bear case: $35-37M quarterly revenue (10-12% margins)
- Middle case: $38-42M quarterly revenue (12-14% margins) 
- Bull case: $43M+ quarterly revenue (15%+ margins)

4. The company is taking cost reduction actions including laying off ~150 employees to align with lower revenue expectations.

Given the mixed signals but overall cautious tone, reduced guidance, and clear pressure on key business segments like RPO, I expect a modestly negative short-term impact on the stock price. While there are some bright spots like ATS strength, the broader economic challenges and reduced outlook will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the near term.
