Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on IBM's stock price. Here's my analysis:

Key Positives:
- Very strong Q2 results with revenue up 13% and EPS up 28% YoY
- Raised full year EPS guidance by $0.25 to at least $8.75
- Strong performance across all major segments (Services, Software, Hardware)
- Healthy growth in both emerging markets (14%) and established markets (5%)
- Robust services signings growth of 12% 
- Strong cash flow generation and balance sheet position
- Management's confident tone about H2 2008 outlook

Minor Concerns:
- Some currency benefit boosting reported numbers
- System x server revenue declined 5%
- Some services contracts rolled into Q3

The results significantly beat expectations and the raised guidance demonstrates management's confidence in the business momentum despite macro concerns. The broad-based strength across geographies and business segments suggests sustainable performance.
