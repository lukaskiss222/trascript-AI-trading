Based on the earnings transcript analysis, IBM delivered a strong quarter with several positive indicators for future growth. Key points supporting a positive outlook:

1. Solid execution with 13% EPS growth despite currency headwinds
2. Major product launches coming in Q3 (new mainframe and Power systems)
3. Improving services trends and strong software performance
4. Raised full year EPS guidance to at least $11.25
5. Growth markets performing well, now equal in size to Euro-zone business

However, there are some modest concerns:

1. Currency headwinds impacting reported numbers
2. Some weakness in public sector spending
3. Services signings down 12% year-over-year

Overall, the positives significantly outweigh the negatives. The company is executing well and has strong momentum heading into the second half with major product cycles. The raised guidance and management's confident tone suggest the stock should perform well over the next 1-2 weeks.
