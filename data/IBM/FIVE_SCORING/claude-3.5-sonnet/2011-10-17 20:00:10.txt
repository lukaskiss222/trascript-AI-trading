Based on my analysis of IBM's Q3 earnings call transcript, here are the key points supporting my rating:

Positives:
- Strong EPS growth of 15% YoY to $3.28
- Raised full year EPS guidance to $13.35 from $13.25
- Software segment showed robust 13% revenue growth
- Strong growth in strategic initiatives (Cloud, Analytics, Smarter Planet)
- Healthy growth markets performance with 13% constant currency growth
- Expanded operating margins

Concerns:
- Major markets growth was flat this quarter, showing deceleration
- Financial services sector growth slowed meaningfully
- Services backlog declined sequentially for first time in 5 years
- System z revenue declined 5% facing tough comparisons
- Macro uncertainty could impact Q4 transactional volumes

Overall, while there are some concerns about growth deceleration in certain areas, IBM demonstrated strong execution, margin expansion and raised guidance. The company appears well-positioned with its strategic initiatives and growth markets exposure to maintain momentum.
