Based on the earnings call transcript, IBM faces significant near-term headwinds that will likely pressure the stock price. Key concerns include:

1. Missed earnings expectations and abandoned 2015 EPS target of $20
2. Weakness across major segments including software and services
3. Significant currency headwinds expected to impact Q4 and 2015
4. Services signings and backlog declining
5. Major restructuring and workforce rebalancing charges coming in Q4

While management outlined strategic initiatives around cloud, analytics, and mobile, and highlighted divestitures of underperforming businesses, the transformation appears to be taking longer than expected. The defensive tone from executives and acknowledgment of execution issues suggests continued challenges ahead.

The market is likely to view this as a significant reset quarter that will take time to work through, putting pressure on the stock in the near-term.
