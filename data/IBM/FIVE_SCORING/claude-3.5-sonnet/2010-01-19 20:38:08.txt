Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on IBM's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong Q4 results with EPS of $3.59 (up 10% YoY) and achievement of 2010 EPS targets one year early
2. Improved revenue growth outlook with guidance for 4-5% better growth in Q1 2020
3. Continued margin expansion and cost savings of $3.7B in 2009
4. Strong software and services signings/pipeline entering 2010
5. Clear guidance for double-digit EPS growth in 2010 (at least $11)

While there are some minor concerns around currency headwinds and European weakness, the overall tone is confident with multiple growth drivers intact and improved business momentum heading into 2010.
