Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on IBM's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerns include:

1. Significant revenue declines in growth markets, particularly China where hardware sales fell 40%
2. Six straight quarters of negative revenue growth and missed consensus expectations
3. Heavy reliance on tax benefits to meet earnings expectations this quarter
4. Ongoing challenges in the hardware business with $1B year-to-date profit decline
5. Questions about ability to meet 2015 EPS target of $20 given current trajectory

While management outlined plans to address these issues, the near-term headwinds appear significant and may cause investors to question IBM's growth prospects and financial model sustainability.
