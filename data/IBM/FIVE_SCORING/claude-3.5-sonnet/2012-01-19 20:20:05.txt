Based on analyzing this earnings transcript, I predict a positive short-term impact on IBM's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong financial execution with revenue of $107B (+7% YoY), operating EPS of $13.44 (+15% YoY), and healthy margins across segments. The company beat expectations and showed particular strength in strategic growth areas like analytics (+16%) and cloud (3x growth).

2. Management's tone was notably confident, providing clear 2012 guidance of at least $14.85 EPS and reaffirming their 2015 roadmap of $20+ EPS. They demonstrated strong momentum in key growth markets and market share gains across most segments.

3. The company showed excellent execution on margins and cost management while maintaining strategic investments, suggesting sustainable earnings growth potential.
