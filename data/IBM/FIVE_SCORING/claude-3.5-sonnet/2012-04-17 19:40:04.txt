Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on IBM's stock price. Here are the key factors:

Positive factors:
- Increased full year 2012 EPS guidance from $14.85 to $15.00
- Strong software revenue growth (7% constant currency) and margins
- Double-digit growth in strategic initiatives like analytics, cloud, and Smarter Planet
- Solid free cash flow generation of $1.9B (up $1.1B YoY)

Some concerns:
- Services backlog down 2% (though growth markets backlog up 14%)
- Hardware revenue declined 7% YoY
- Challenges in GBS services segment especially in Japan
- Currency headwinds expected to continue

Overall, while there are some mixed signals, the raised guidance, strong software performance, and momentum in strategic growth areas should drive positive sentiment in the near-term. Management demonstrated confidence in their execution and long-term strategy.
