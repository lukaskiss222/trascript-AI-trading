Based on the earnings call transcript, IBM demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Revenue growth improved to 4% at constant currency, with particularly strong performance in growth markets (up 13%)
2. Key segments showed momentum:
- Systems/Technology revenue up 10%
- Software revenue growth expected to accelerate in Q4
- Global Business Services up 5%

3. Margins expanded across segments and the company increased full year EPS guidance to $11.40 (up from $11.25)

4. Strong product cycle momentum with new mainframe and Power systems launches

5. Management expressed confidence in Q4 outlook, particularly in software acceleration and continued hardware strength

The main concerns are around services signings being down, but management provided reasonable explanations and indicated a strong pipeline ahead.

Given the broad-based strength across segments, improved guidance, and management's confident outlook for Q4, I expect this earnings report to have a positive near-term impact on the stock.
