Based on the earnings call transcript, I am positive about IBM's short-term stock outlook. Key reasons:

1. Strong Q1 performance with EPS up 16% YoY and revenue growth of 5%, indicating business momentum

2. Management raised full-year EPS guidance by $0.20 to at least $11.20, demonstrating confidence

3. Software segment showed excellent growth (11%) with expanding margins, driving profitability

4. Strategic initiatives like business analytics and cloud are gaining traction

5. Strong cash position ($14B) and continued share buybacks provide support

The overall tone was quite confident, with management highlighting broad-based improvements across segments and geographies. The combination of raised guidance, strong software performance, and upcoming product cycles suggests positive momentum over the next few weeks.
