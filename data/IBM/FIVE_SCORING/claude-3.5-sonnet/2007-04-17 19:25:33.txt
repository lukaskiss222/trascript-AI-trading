Based on my analysis of IBM's Q1 earnings call, I anticipate a modestly positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Positives:
- Strong global performance, especially in Asia Pacific (9% growth) and Europe showing improvement
- Maintained full-year EPS growth guidance of 11-12%
- Strong performance in key strategic areas like software middleware (17% growth) and Global Business Services (32% profit growth)
- Continued strength in high-margin mainframe and POWER systems

Concerns:
- U.S. market weakness, particularly in March enterprise spending
- Services margins declined, though management outlined clear plans for improvement
- Some softness in storage and microelectronics revenue

Overall, while there are some near-term challenges in the U.S. market, IBM's global diversification, maintained guidance, and strength in key strategic businesses should provide support for the stock. The execution plans outlined for addressing weak areas appear credible.
