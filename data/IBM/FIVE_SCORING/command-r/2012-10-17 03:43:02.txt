IBM's mixed Q3 results and cautious tone indicate short-term challenges. Revenue missed expectations due to weak software and services performance, particularly in the US and growth markets. However, strong margin expansion and focus on productivity initiatives helped maintain profit levels. The near term is clouded by deal delays and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, but new product launches and growth initiatives offer potential for the longer term. The stock will likely face pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
