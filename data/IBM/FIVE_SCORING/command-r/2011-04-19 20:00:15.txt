IBM's robust Q1 earnings report demonstrates strong performance across its business segments, particularly in growth initiatives like Smarter Planet and Business Analytics. The company's focus on cloud, analytics, and strategic outsourcing bodes well for the future. Impressive margin expansion and a healthy balance sheet also boost its prospects. However, the underwhelming services signings and the potential impact of the Japan crisis on future quarters create short-term uncertainty. The stock is likely to experience a positive, but modest impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks. [1]
