While the USmarket showed signs of weakness, management remains confident in their Growth and Value strategy, focusing on emerging markets and higher-value segments. The stock is likely to experience a positive, albeit modest, impact in the short term, bolstered by robust international sales, a solid services pipeline, and continued investment in growth initiatives.
