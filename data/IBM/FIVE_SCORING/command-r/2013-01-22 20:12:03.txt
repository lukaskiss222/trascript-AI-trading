IBM's earnings call showed a company focused on software growth and margin optimization. The emphasis on high-margin software and initiatives like Business Analytics and Cloud computing is positive, with management anticipating continued software success. However, the muted revenue growth outlook for 2013 and uncertainties around hardware and services growth are concerning. The stock is likely to remain stable in the short term as investors assess the growth prospects.
