The market's reaction to IBM's earnings call is likely to be cautious optimism. While the report reveals short-term challenges, including achieved EPS growth driven largely by tax benefits and a conservative 2014 outlook, the company's long-term focus on cognitive computing, cloud, and emerging markets is promising. The stock is unlikely to see a substantial boost in the short term, but nor should it experience a significant drop, given IBM's steady performance and commitment to its 2015 roadmap.
